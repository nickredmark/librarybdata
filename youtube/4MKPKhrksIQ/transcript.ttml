<p begin="00:00:10.260" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">session we are going over the prototype</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">for the project tracker which hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">part of this will also be involved with</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:21.000" style="s2">coming up with a better name but this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:25.980" style="s2">talking off and on about and people have</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:28.050" style="s2">you know asked about something similar</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.980" end="00:00:29.880" style="s2">in one degree or another in the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.050" end="00:00:31.700" style="s2">group I would say probably three to five</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.880" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">times at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.700" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">so other any questions before we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">started and do screen sharing and is it</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">okay if I put the link to their website</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">on the screen um yeah sure that made</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">sense okay Pablo there&#39;s been in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">works how long have you been working on</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:54.059" style="s2">it I&#39;m like the actual prototype maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.059" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">I like until I mean I technically added</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">the objects longer than that but not it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">was barely started then so effectively</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d say about two weeks it is built</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">on the neck platform which means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:09.590" style="s2">not it&#39;s not coated it&#39;s kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:11.010" style="s2">know a drag-and-drop</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.590" end="00:01:14.520" style="s2">what-you-see-is-what-you-get style</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.010" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">editor there&#39;s definitely going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">some features that you know people might</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">ask for that we just can builder that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to build so this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">of meant to be a proof of concept that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:25.880" style="s2">meant to get us as close to this as</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:28.860" style="s2">possible we&#39;re we&#39;re seeing some</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.880" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">benefits out of it and then ideally</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.860" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">enough till we actually get some users</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">using it so people understand what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">trying to do and then we can move into</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:38.850" style="s2">an actual like coded version Hey and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:43.310" style="s2">Betty&#39;s here about him this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.850" end="00:01:43.310" style="s2">prototype exactly this is a prototype</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.030" end="00:01:48.149" style="s2">then here Henley did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.530" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">anything before we get started with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.149" end="00:01:55.350" style="s2">piece preacher did you already give</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">updates are we even doing that today I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.350" end="00:02:04.350" style="s2">can&#39;t remember now it&#39;s just the the</p>

<p begin="00:02:04.350" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">is if we have enough time after the neck</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:10.209" style="s2">one there&#39;s a another prototype I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:15.159" style="s2">hoping to show about</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.209" end="00:02:20.290" style="s2">the patio video chat stuff so cool if we</p>

<p begin="00:02:34.780" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">image you won&#39;t need to because I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.969" end="00:02:41.409" style="s2">screen sharing and I can actually here</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:43.780" style="s2">on site with me share my screen and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.409" end="00:02:46.540" style="s2">we can switch the way that this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.780" end="00:02:47.859" style="s2">arranged that I should have to do some</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.540" end="00:02:49.269" style="s2">sharing of a nun sharing and then re</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.859" end="00:02:52.180" style="s2">sharing just because all in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.269" end="00:02:54.909" style="s2">Chromebook and don&#39;t have a ton of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.180" end="00:02:58.329" style="s2">so let me switch oh really did that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.909" end="00:03:00.519" style="s2">perfect so we&#39;re looking at the public</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.329" end="00:03:02.859" style="s2">for version versa mint and incognito tab</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.519" end="00:03:05.079" style="s2">because I&#39;m actually logged in in Chrome</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.859" end="00:03:07.919" style="s2">so this is how it&#39;ll look if you just go</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.079" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">and view the the prototype without</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.919" end="00:03:11.169" style="s2">looking in its gonna start you off on</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:13.719" style="s2">the home page which has got a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.169" end="00:03:15.819" style="s2">rough description of the different pages</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.719" end="00:03:18.010" style="s2">available the home page in theory should</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.819" end="00:03:20.379" style="s2">end up having sort of the most used</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.010" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">features things that will relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.379" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">other pages and you&#39;ve got your two tabs</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:27.849" style="s2">up here projects and events with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:31.810" style="s2">some sub pages each under projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.849" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">project directory this is a list of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.810" end="00:03:36.040" style="s2">the projects that have been submitted</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:37.030" style="s2">and these are only ones that are being</p>

<p begin="00:03:54.299" end="00:03:59.049" style="s2">made the ones public that either are</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.910" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">category that&#39;s been put into the short</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.070" end="00:04:43.910" style="s2">intro which is kind of just meant to be</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.900" end="00:06:10.100" style="s2">he would need to add in order to ask for</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.150" end="00:06:12.070" style="s2">help that&#39;s a part of what we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.100" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">for feedback on is to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.070" end="00:06:16.670" style="s2">project owners feel that there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:18.740" style="s2">here that they can actually use it to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.670" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">indicate the areas that they need help</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.740" end="00:06:24.110" style="s2">and then underneath we have the two</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:25.910" style="s2">different event areas there&#39;s upcoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.110" end="00:06:27.980" style="s2">events so you can see here there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.910" end="00:06:30.500" style="s2">wiki election livestream for tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.980" end="00:06:32.300" style="s2">it&#39;s got the public URL so again if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.500" end="00:06:34.760" style="s2">had you know things scheduled in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.300" end="00:06:37.590" style="s2">future this could be a spot where you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.760" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">can just go to that page</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.590" end="00:06:40.980" style="s2">you&#39;ll see later this is also listed</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.690" style="s2">somewhere else so it just makes it easy</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.980" end="00:06:44.970" style="s2">to see what all the different projects</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.690" end="00:06:47.940" style="s2">have scheduled and be able to join from</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.970" end="00:06:52.350" style="s2">here we are also tracking on the backend</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.940" end="00:06:54.330" style="s2">what the I guess the panelist URL is so</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.350" end="00:06:55.800" style="s2">if people sign up for events actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.330" end="00:06:58.920" style="s2">you know join of the panelists where</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.800" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">they&#39;re you know using their webcam and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.920" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">a microphone they&#39;ll have that URL</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:07.170" style="s2">available if they&#39;ve been registered and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:09.180" style="s2">then finally we have the completed</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.170" end="00:07:10.470" style="s2">events which mostly make sense for</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.180" end="00:07:12.150" style="s2">things like live streams because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.470" end="00:07:15.000" style="s2">public URL turns into this you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.150" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">streaming later URL so if this was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.000" end="00:07:19.500" style="s2">topic you&#39;re interested in you can go to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:21.570" style="s2">view it there those last two aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.500" end="00:07:22.650" style="s2">terribly important on the project page</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.570" end="00:07:24.510" style="s2">but they&#39;re still there so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.650" end="00:07:26.010" style="s2">it it&#39;s more useful when you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.510" end="00:07:27.540" style="s2">seeing a list of all the events so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.010" end="00:07:29.730" style="s2">can see sort of what&#39;s coming up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.540" end="00:07:34.110" style="s2">what&#39;s happened in the past and again</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.730" end="00:07:35.730" style="s2">same kinds of information available the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.110" end="00:07:38.070" style="s2">other area under projects is for help</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.730" end="00:07:42.060" style="s2">needed and so this is just a list of all</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.070" end="00:07:43.500" style="s2">the different help needed posts that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.060" end="00:07:45.420" style="s2">different projects have made so right</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.500" end="00:07:48.540" style="s2">now there&#39;s only one from with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.420" end="00:07:51.180" style="s2">election if we went to let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.540" end="00:07:53.880" style="s2">reason score and Bentley had added</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.180" end="00:07:55.500" style="s2">something under help needed then under</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.880" end="00:07:57.270" style="s2">the Pelt needed page you would actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.500" end="00:07:59.790" style="s2">see two posts one from wiki election the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.270" end="00:08:01.410" style="s2">one from reason score where of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.790" end="00:08:03.810" style="s2">the Eagle here is to say hey here&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.410" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">know the five or ten areas that some</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.810" end="00:08:07.380" style="s2">people across all these different</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:09.450" style="s2">projects are looking for help and as it</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.380" end="00:08:11.100" style="s2">gets into you know a lot more we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.450" end="00:08:12.390" style="s2">start to add filters and give people the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.100" end="00:08:14.460" style="s2">ability to say hey show me you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.390" end="00:08:16.470" style="s2">either what kind of like sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.460" end="00:08:17.610" style="s2">projects need help or you can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.470" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">something like show me who needs help</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.610" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">with marketing because that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:24.900" style="s2">good at that kind of thing and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:27.480" style="s2">going to look the same as if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.900" end="00:08:28.860" style="s2">view upon the project page it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.480" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">different way to see a list sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.860" end="00:08:36.919" style="s2">across all the projects does this make</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:36.919" style="s2">sense so far yeah it looks good</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.530" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">so the second part to the public view is</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.410" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">the events so there&#39;s scheduled events</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:46.350" style="s2">where these are things that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:50.010" style="s2">you know in theory definitely going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.350" end="00:08:50.910" style="s2">happen it&#39;s split into two sections one</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.010" end="00:08:53.580" style="s2">is project event</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:08:56.130" style="s2">so just like it sounds these are events</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.580" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">that are linked to a project same as</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.130" end="00:09:01.860" style="s2">before you know if reason score had a a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:04.170" style="s2">live stream or an event published you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.860" end="00:09:06.660" style="s2">would see all the events across all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.170" end="00:09:09.030" style="s2">different projects that are scheduled in</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.660" end="00:09:11.340" style="s2">the future there&#39;s some amount of sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.030" end="00:09:13.110" style="s2">of timezone translation here so we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.340" end="00:09:17.640" style="s2">see you know that it&#39;s happening at noon</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.110" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern 8 p.m. GMT or UTC</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.640" end="00:09:22.410" style="s2">or whatever we want to call it and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:26.100" style="s2">expected to be around an hour and again</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.410" end="00:09:28.290" style="s2">delete join and then the other part are</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.100" end="00:09:30.030" style="s2">the events that aren&#39;t linked to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.290" end="00:09:33.840" style="s2">project so that&#39;s going to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.030" end="00:09:35.310" style="s2">things like possibly idea cafes or just</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.840" end="00:09:38.040" style="s2">something where you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.310" end="00:09:39.570" style="s2">buy-in from multiple people to say yep I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.040" end="00:09:41.580" style="s2">would show up to that you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.570" end="00:09:45.140" style="s2">finalist so it&#39;s not just one person</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.580" end="00:09:47.670" style="s2">talking it&#39;s kind of trying to get um</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.140" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">the buy-in from people but these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.670" end="00:09:51.930" style="s2">topics that are confirmed as yep you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">know we got the minimum number of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.930" end="00:09:57.990" style="s2">this should be happening and then under</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:00.150" style="s2">events you&#39;ve got proposed events which</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.990" end="00:10:02.040" style="s2">these are meant to be events that people</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.150" end="00:10:03.990" style="s2">are saying you know hey I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.040" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">in talking about this here&#39;s the time</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.990" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in talking at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:09.270" style="s2">duration and time zone stuff again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:11.820" style="s2">then again you can see how many people</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.270" end="00:10:14.250" style="s2">are confirmed so when you&#39;re signed in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.820" end="00:10:16.920" style="s2">as a member you&#39;ll be able to say you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.250" end="00:10:19.310" style="s2">know I want to go to that and then after</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.920" end="00:10:23.490" style="s2">we get a certain number it can</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.310" end="00:10:27.000" style="s2">automatically propose to the schedule</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.490" end="00:10:35.070" style="s2">list so does that make sense for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.000" end="00:10:37.110" style="s2">public view yeah perfect so now let me I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.070" end="00:10:39.470" style="s2">should go back here and stop sharing for</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.110" end="00:10:39.470" style="s2">a second</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.350" end="00:10:52.300" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d gone in and put there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.650" end="00:10:53.950" style="s2">already I think you had a stub in there</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.300" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">for reasons go I went and filled out a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.950" end="00:10:57.130" style="s2">few of the things I didn&#39;t get to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.570" end="00:11:02.790" style="s2">events or the requesting people I might</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.130" end="00:11:05.830" style="s2">go ahead and do that but it seems usable</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.790" end="00:11:08.010" style="s2">and then if we want to go forward we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.830" end="00:11:10.120" style="s2">might just figure out how we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.010" end="00:11:12.910" style="s2">post about it because a couple people</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.120" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">keep kind of asking for this right sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.910" end="00:11:16.600" style="s2">of thing when they come in but maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:20.950" style="s2">should hear what Ghibli and Susan I</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.600" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">think and there is still the the member</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.950" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">area but if it is adding to no on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:29.430" style="s2">public sort of before we switch hats you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.320" end="00:11:32.230" style="s2">get that and go to the back end yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.430" end="00:11:37.750" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t think did I get an email</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.230" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">invite I think I do still need to like</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.750" end="00:11:41.020" style="s2">do some testing and figure out how the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:43.180" style="s2">emails go out after you&#39;re approved you</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.020" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">have been you have been approved I</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.180" end="00:11:47.020" style="s2">didn&#39;t add like the stub article for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:48.850" style="s2">because I wasn&#39;t sure exactly how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.020" end="00:11:51.220" style="s2">wanted to sort of spell or arrange the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.850" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2">Touro flow coming there wasn&#39;t sure</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.220" end="00:11:56.380" style="s2">oh oh oh you ready bro and then flow all</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:11:58.660" style="s2">together okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.380" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">cultural cultural content culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.660" end="00:12:05.410" style="s2">comments okay yeah I had mostly right</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:07.390" style="s2">okay he&#39;s checking again to see if there</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.410" end="00:12:10.840" style="s2">was a way I could I can&#39;t put in events</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.390" end="00:12:12.760" style="s2">I was under the events page or under</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.840" end="00:12:15.070" style="s2">solution raising events what is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.760" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">option to add it that&#39;s what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.070" end="00:12:21.270" style="s2">to go over next so the the member area</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:24.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t ideal it&#39;s kind of a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.270" end="00:12:25.420" style="s2">restriction in knack there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.040" end="00:12:26.980" style="s2">ways you can do it this seem to be that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.420" end="00:12:28.170" style="s2">the better way so we&#39;ll go through it</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.980" end="00:12:30.220" style="s2">and if it&#39;s you know completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.170" end="00:12:35.170" style="s2">offensive then we can look at some other</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.220" end="00:12:39.100" style="s2">ways of doing it so now we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.170" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re logged in and it looks very</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.100" end="00:12:42.520" style="s2">much the same you know you&#39;ve got home</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:44.440" style="s2">projects events that that&#39;s all exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.520" end="00:12:47.350" style="s2">the same the only thing different is you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.440" end="00:12:49.930" style="s2">have a new tab called member area if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.350" end="00:12:51.430" style="s2">click on member area well I see that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.930" end="00:12:53.530" style="s2">image isn&#39;t loading anymore that&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.430" end="00:12:56.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just a screenshot saying to use</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.530" end="00:12:57.790" style="s2">this section here so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.200" end="00:12:59.740" style="s2">when you log in you go to member area</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.790" end="00:13:00.870" style="s2">and now all of the things that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.740" end="00:13:05.700" style="s2">you can do as a member</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">in this gray bar here so you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.700" end="00:13:08.970" style="s2">can go to your account settings and do</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:12.390" style="s2">your basic you know changing your email</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.970" end="00:13:14.640" style="s2">and password and stuff like that you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.390" end="00:13:16.589" style="s2">go to your my projects or so I&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.640" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">got the one project you can hit view and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.589" end="00:13:19.740" style="s2">sort of see how it looks or if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:22.170" style="s2">actually want to change something you</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.740" end="00:13:23.850" style="s2">can go there head--it and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.170" end="00:13:26.370" style="s2">you can do things like saying actually I</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.850" end="00:13:28.470" style="s2">don&#39;t want to publish it or but by</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.370" end="00:13:29.910" style="s2">default like if you submitted your</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.470" end="00:13:32.130" style="s2">project in the past when you sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.910" end="00:13:33.510" style="s2">a member account and I notice it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.130" end="00:13:35.010" style="s2">I&#39;ll actually assign that to you so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.510" end="00:13:37.529" style="s2">might already have one when you pop in</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.010" end="00:13:39.450" style="s2">it&#39;ll default to not being published you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.529" end="00:13:41.310" style="s2">can say yes and then it will show up</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.450" end="00:13:46.410" style="s2">when somebody who&#39;s you know a member of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.310" end="00:13:48.089" style="s2">the public and hasn&#39;t logged in they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.410" end="00:13:49.710" style="s2">be able to go to the project directory</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.089" end="00:13:51.390" style="s2">and see your project if it&#39;s set to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.710" end="00:13:52.740" style="s2">published and then everything else is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.390" end="00:13:56.790" style="s2">just the details that we saw on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.740" end="00:13:58.680" style="s2">page we probably do need to do some work</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.790" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">categories I think since making an</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.680" end="00:14:02.220" style="s2">education or the only two I have it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:05.160" style="s2">there right now we can add those quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.220" end="00:14:06.420" style="s2">easily but for the ones that had in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.160" end="00:14:12.750" style="s2">prototype those need to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.420" end="00:14:16.170" style="s2">common culture honestly don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.750" end="00:14:20.220" style="s2">sense and what um solution raising is</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.170" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">like solutions yeah I have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.220" end="00:14:23.400" style="s2">different like groups of categories</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.800" style="s2">where we&#39;ll have to figure it out to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.400" end="00:14:27.570" style="s2">know have it makes sense it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.800" end="00:14:29.459" style="s2">important that sort of it works for</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.570" end="00:14:32.540" style="s2">project owners you know that you feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.459" end="00:14:34.680" style="s2">like yeah that um that generally sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.540" end="00:14:36.779" style="s2">somewhat decently categorizes the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.680" end="00:14:39.180" style="s2">project and it also makes sense for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.779" end="00:14:40.589" style="s2">potential you know volunteers to show up</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.180" end="00:14:42.330" style="s2">and it makes sense that that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.589" end="00:14:44.040" style="s2">would structured the you know projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.330" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">that they might be interested in helping</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.040" end="00:14:50.220" style="s2">out with yeah so you need to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:53.730" style="s2">people and do card sorting right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.220" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">what is the dominant words that to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.730" end="00:14:59.850" style="s2">that I need to get people involved</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:01.350" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s hopefully what this will</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.850" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">come up with and I would love your help</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.350" end="00:15:04.350" style="s2">on that because it sounds like you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:06.050" style="s2">hell of a lot more experienced what</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.350" end="00:15:09.780" style="s2">brand it comes to that kind of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.050" end="00:15:12.410" style="s2">have I have some experience just not for</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.780" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">the last you know five or ten years okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.410" end="00:15:17.990" style="s2">yeah so this is built so you could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.610" style="s2">the owner of multiple projects and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.990" end="00:15:21.290" style="s2">you know you can go in and view each one</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:23.449" style="s2">you want to add a project there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.290" end="00:15:26.209" style="s2">the add project button and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.449" end="00:15:27.949" style="s2">got your basic stuff here and then after</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.209" end="00:15:30.139" style="s2">it&#39;s added you&#39;ll be the one that owns</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.949" end="00:15:32.209" style="s2">it right now it&#39;s just one user per</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.139" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">project your your your essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.209" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">owner of that project record in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:37.459" style="s2">database so you&#39;ll be the one who can</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:41.660" style="s2">see it and you control if it&#39;s published</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.459" end="00:15:42.920" style="s2">or not and then from here from view you</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.660" end="00:15:45.800" style="s2">know you can do things like add project</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.920" end="00:15:48.589" style="s2">roles where product accruals are made to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.800" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">either say who is working on it or you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.589" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">can say like yep they&#39;re active and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:53.720" style="s2">they&#39;re actually doing it you can pick</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">the member and so on or you can say we</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.720" end="00:15:56.689" style="s2">need help and then it shows up in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:59.300" style="s2">help needed section so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.689" end="00:16:03.560" style="s2">meant for both not the most usable but</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.300" end="00:16:05.779" style="s2">it&#39;s what we have for now under project</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.560" end="00:16:07.939" style="s2">roles that&#39;s the actual roles that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.779" end="00:16:10.100" style="s2">have in a project so of course in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.939" end="00:16:12.529" style="s2">case I have a role as a product owner</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.100" end="00:16:15.500" style="s2">wiki election if I were helping out on</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.529" end="00:16:17.240" style="s2">reason score or something I might also</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.500" end="00:16:19.910" style="s2">have a project role here for reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.240" end="00:16:21.350" style="s2">score I wouldn&#39;t have a reason score</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.910" end="00:16:23.420" style="s2">under my projects because I don&#39;t own it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.350" end="00:16:27.019" style="s2">but I can at least go there and change</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.420" end="00:16:28.939" style="s2">like the information available in things</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.019" end="00:16:32.660" style="s2">I don&#39;t own the project but I control</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.939" end="00:16:34.519" style="s2">you know like for example if I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.660" end="00:16:38.120" style="s2">working on a project anymore I might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.519" end="00:16:39.589" style="s2">able to deactivate my project role but</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.120" end="00:16:42.230" style="s2">for now that&#39;s mostly on the project</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.589" end="00:16:44.149" style="s2">owner side but would you have a spot</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.230" end="00:16:45.920" style="s2">that we are able to you know give people</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.149" end="00:16:47.389" style="s2">access to change their their their</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.920" end="00:16:50.209" style="s2">project roles if they feel so inclined</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.389" end="00:16:52.220" style="s2">if you were going to be volunteering on</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.209" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">projects and you didn&#39;t have a project</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.220" end="00:16:56.689" style="s2">of your own in mind projects page would</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:16:58.850" style="s2">be empty and then your project roles</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.689" end="00:17:01.009" style="s2">page will have every role that you play</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.850" end="00:17:02.660" style="s2">across possibly multiple projects right</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.009" end="00:17:04.100" style="s2">so if you were volunteering with three</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.660" end="00:17:08.110" style="s2">projects you have three project roles</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.100" end="00:17:10.790" style="s2">and no projects does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.110" end="00:17:13.700" style="s2">mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.790" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">and then finally we have B my events and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.700" end="00:17:17.570" style="s2">there is the my events with those again</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:19.850" style="s2">are the events that you own so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.570" end="00:17:21.650" style="s2">similar to two to the projects where one</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.850" end="00:17:24.710" style="s2">user can sort of add an event and keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.650" end="00:17:28.700" style="s2">it up to two to date with things as they</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.710" end="00:17:31.040" style="s2">change you can see I have two ones in</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.700" end="00:17:33.680" style="s2">the past ones in the future and then if</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.040" end="00:17:34.790" style="s2">you sign up for an event and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.680" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">role and it&#39;s sort of you know you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.790" end="00:17:38.570" style="s2">aren&#39;t the owner but you want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">to for example say actually no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.570" end="00:17:43.820" style="s2">coming or if there&#39;s some amount of back</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:45.350" style="s2">and forth and being able to control how</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.820" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">and when and if you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.350" end="00:17:50.350" style="s2">interacting with an event that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:54.440" style="s2">home that&#39;s done under event invitations</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.350" end="00:17:55.790" style="s2">so event invitations the ones that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.440" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">said yes I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.790" end="00:18:01.880" style="s2">yes I&#39;m participating in yes everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:06.140" style="s2">participating and all running it</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.880" end="00:18:07.790" style="s2">technically it would show up here and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.140" end="00:18:10.580" style="s2">then if you&#39;re watching it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.790" end="00:18:13.370" style="s2">need to register you can just go to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.580" end="00:18:18.580" style="s2">scheduled events and click there to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:20.600" style="s2">watch it and it&#39;s more we you know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.580" end="00:18:22.850" style="s2">future people want to be able to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.600" end="00:18:24.710" style="s2">like bookmark things that you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.850" end="00:18:26.330" style="s2">end up with a bunch of events and people</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.710" end="00:18:27.920" style="s2">want to be able to say well that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.330" end="00:18:29.480" style="s2">interesting you know I want to see that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.920" end="00:18:33.320" style="s2">and sort of a separate list of things</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.480" end="00:18:38.570" style="s2">that I&#39;ve curated for myself we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.320" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">build that but then under events also</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.570" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">there&#39;s the ability to add events there</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.630" end="00:18:48.140" style="s2">so for the times for right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.370" end="00:18:49.730" style="s2">everything is entered in Pacific time</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.140" end="00:18:52.010" style="s2">and then the other fields are are</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.730" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">calculated right so it just says the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.010" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">eastern time is just the Pacific time</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:18:59.480" style="s2">plus three hours and GMT is the Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:19:01.220" style="s2">time plus eight hours and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.480" end="00:19:03.080" style="s2">know there&#39;s some need to have the end</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.220" end="00:19:06.620" style="s2">time we can also calculate you know take</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.080" end="00:19:09.170" style="s2">the start time add the duration to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.620" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s your year end time I figured</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.170" end="00:19:12.680" style="s2">that having start time and duration is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:13.750" style="s2">probably enough for now but we can tweak</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.680" end="00:19:16.790" style="s2">that as needed</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.750" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.790" end="00:19:21.890" style="s2">keep up with the changing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:23.679" style="s2">differences between GMT and you might</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.890" end="00:19:26.299" style="s2">just take that out and make people</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.679" end="00:19:28.249" style="s2">we might be able to do an automated link</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.299" end="00:19:31.899" style="s2">to one of the time and date websites</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.249" end="00:19:35.539" style="s2">that will give them lots of it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.899" end="00:19:37.460" style="s2">yeah if this ends up being unwieldy then</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.539" end="00:19:39.739" style="s2">yeah we can totally do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.460" end="00:19:41.419" style="s2">each one is a separate ones like if</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.739" end="00:19:43.309" style="s2">we&#39;re saying you know that GMT just</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.419" end="00:19:44.929" style="s2">changes at a different time it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.309" end="00:19:46.789" style="s2">pain but it&#39;s just going in and changing</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.929" end="00:19:48.769" style="s2">one field on the back end say oh now</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.789" end="00:19:50.809" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s plus seven instead of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.769" end="00:19:54.649" style="s2">plus eight and then a week later</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.809" end="00:19:57.159" style="s2">changing it back yeah well but only B</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.649" end="00:19:59.749" style="s2">you would change it like when the winner</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.159" end="00:20:01.669" style="s2">America does it you probably change PT</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.749" end="00:20:04.220" style="s2">or PPD you wouldn&#39;t but you would change</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.669" end="00:20:05.809" style="s2">eastern time and actually wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.220" end="00:20:06.859" style="s2">because they would yes I think the only</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.809" end="00:20:09.470" style="s2">thing that would be weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.859" end="00:20:11.419" style="s2">it is GMT because they change their</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.470" end="00:20:15.019" style="s2">clocks at a difference a couple weeks</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.419" end="00:20:17.090" style="s2">different yeah well I agree yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.019" end="00:20:18.200" style="s2">bit messy in it yeah I guess it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.090" end="00:20:19.369" style="s2">better way to do it you&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.200" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">problem because of the dates in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.369" end="00:20:23.950" style="s2">future then some will be in the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:26.359" style="s2">during the change them well that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.950" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">it might be good just to take it off for</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.359" end="00:20:30.619" style="s2">now cuz it all it won&#39;t be right</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:32.779" style="s2">perfectly I think they&#39;ve all now</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.619" end="00:20:34.249" style="s2">changed over and we have until fall and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.779" end="00:20:37.309" style="s2">who knows what the world looks like in</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.249" end="00:20:38.840" style="s2">fall right yeah if there&#39;s Australia and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.309" end="00:20:43.369" style="s2">North America all change their clocks</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.840" end="00:20:50.179" style="s2">were good until the fall and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.369" end="00:20:52.549" style="s2">decade away very true yeah and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.179" end="00:20:54.470" style="s2">just meant to be sort of you know again</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.549" end="00:20:56.029" style="s2">part of the prototype I find that most</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.470" end="00:20:58.489" style="s2">people are pretty good at knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.029" end="00:20:59.809" style="s2">convert their own time zone you know so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.489" end="00:21:02.269" style="s2">people get used to like oh hey it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.809" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">new Pacific that&#39;s of a Pacific is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.269" end="00:21:07.309" style="s2">fairly standard one so hopefully people</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:08.929" style="s2">will know how to convert it um but if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.309" end="00:21:10.909" style="s2">can sort of make this work more group</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.929" end="00:21:12.470" style="s2">more gracefully then I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.909" end="00:21:14.029" style="s2">helpful to be able to just you know go</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.470" end="00:21:15.739" style="s2">onto the column and say okay that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.029" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">get my time cool especially if you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.739" end="00:21:20.929" style="s2">people from various time zones although</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:24.590" style="s2">I guess they all have them is it for</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.929" end="00:21:26.210" style="s2">time anyway so that&#39;s kind of moved but</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.590" end="00:21:27.979" style="s2">I think that&#39;s about it to show for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.210" end="00:21:29.359" style="s2">prototype so far so you have your public</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.979" end="00:21:31.669" style="s2">version with projects and events and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.359" end="00:21:33.769" style="s2">then your your your member account you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.669" end="00:21:36.809" style="s2">go to member area it&#39;s the gray bar up</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.769" end="00:21:38.940" style="s2">here and you can change your own account</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.809" end="00:21:48.379" style="s2">project that Rosie playing a project and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.940" end="00:21:50.700" style="s2">your events during this time period</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.379" end="00:21:52.529" style="s2">solution raising is to have somebody add</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.700" end="00:21:54.440" style="s2">a project or do that during this time</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.529" end="00:21:56.850" style="s2">that maybe we could do that on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.440" end="00:21:58.110" style="s2">different video and upload it just so</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.850" end="00:22:01.649" style="s2">people know how they can add their</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.110" end="00:22:03.870" style="s2">projects to to it themselves I did it</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.649" end="00:22:07.409" style="s2">and it was fairly intuitive and if I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.870" end="00:22:09.210" style="s2">do it even though I hate slack and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.409" end="00:22:12.990" style="s2">hate discard and I hate certain other</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.210" end="00:22:15.899" style="s2">things it&#39;s fairly user friendly so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.990" end="00:22:19.080" style="s2">and I fully understand the you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.899" end="00:22:20.369" style="s2">people have some reluctance to sign up</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.080" end="00:22:24.749" style="s2">for yet another member account</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.369" end="00:22:26.759" style="s2">I&#39;m 100% I understand all of that but at</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.749" end="00:22:28.830" style="s2">this point that&#39;s a there is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.759" end="00:22:31.049" style="s2">to have some sort of single sign-on but</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.830" end="00:22:32.850" style="s2">it seems to be like for companies so</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.049" end="00:22:34.049" style="s2">it&#39;s got like Facebook and Google how</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.850" end="00:22:35.909" style="s2">it&#39;s made if like you&#39;re all a part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.049" end="00:22:39.690" style="s2">the same domain which we aren&#39;t at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.909" end="00:22:43.129" style="s2">moment then that won&#39;t work so for now</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.690" end="00:22:46.889" style="s2">you do have to have a a member account</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.129" end="00:22:48.570" style="s2">from the right up on the nak website</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.889" end="00:22:50.490" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be fairly secure</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.570" end="00:22:54.419" style="s2">they have like a pretty detailed page on</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.490" end="00:23:00.920" style="s2">their security methodologies so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.419" end="00:23:03.969" style="s2">see how it it works up the back time</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.920" end="00:23:03.969" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.179" end="00:23:10.529" style="s2">good work thank you if you guys have any</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.759" end="00:23:12.570" style="s2">questions about that either in a session</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.529" end="00:23:16.919" style="s2">or anyone watching feel free to reach</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.570" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">out and as I think I&#39;ve sort of hinted</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.919" end="00:23:20.820" style="s2">at the beginning I think Susan had</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">signed up for an account I have to go in</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:23.879" style="s2">there to prove it right now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:27.629" style="s2">think efforts approved I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.879" end="00:23:29.970" style="s2">sends them an email so like now I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.629" end="00:23:31.019" style="s2">Susan was notified but now you can go in</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.970" end="00:23:33.629" style="s2">there and use your account and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.019" end="00:23:36.210" style="s2">able to sign in add projects of whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.629" end="00:23:37.590" style="s2">so that&#39;s a part of what I&#39;ll have to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.210" end="00:23:39.539" style="s2">at some point is actually going to add</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.590" end="00:23:43.019" style="s2">the alerts for when they&#39;re set to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.539" end="00:23:47.129" style="s2">active right and that and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.019" end="00:23:48.809" style="s2">generates an email exact because it does</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.129" end="00:23:50.279" style="s2">generate an email to me to let me know</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.809" end="00:23:52.379" style="s2">that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.279" end="00:23:54.149" style="s2">registered it&#39;s just when I go in there</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.379" end="00:23:55.799" style="s2">and set them as active there&#39;s no email</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.149" end="00:23:58.950" style="s2">back to you saying hey that user account</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.799" end="00:24:00.659" style="s2">you asked for it it&#39;s active now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.950" end="00:24:02.460" style="s2">that&#39;s really important because I find</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.659" end="00:24:04.950" style="s2">in a lot of the UX stuff that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.460" end="00:24:07.409" style="s2">that there is this initial yes I want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.950" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">do it and then if there is a delay even</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.409" end="00:24:14.330" style="s2">of sometimes hours especially if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:17.639" style="s2">day people just don&#39;t even respond yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.330" end="00:24:19.379" style="s2">which I might if it&#39;s easy to change I</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.639" end="00:24:20.869" style="s2">might just take off the need for</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.379" end="00:24:23.219" style="s2">activation until it becomes a problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.869" end="00:24:24.749" style="s2">like it&#39;s really only manda you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.219" end="00:24:25.830" style="s2">there&#39;s people in there that for some</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.749" end="00:24:27.830" style="s2">reason we don&#39;t want in there people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.830" end="00:24:29.909" style="s2">standing it then I can go in there and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.830" end="00:24:32.909" style="s2">turn it on but that&#39;s actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.909" end="00:24:35.070" style="s2">a better thing to do so now we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.909" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">invite people in the game be projects</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.070" end="00:24:39.839" style="s2">group to come and add their own and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:42.089" style="s2">have to go through the same process</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.839" end="00:24:46.200" style="s2">Susan did write of requesting it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.089" end="00:24:48.509" style="s2">then yeah and if they don&#39;t have our</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.200" end="00:24:50.070" style="s2">project if they don&#39;t have a project</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.509" end="00:24:51.749" style="s2">they can still sign up there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.070" end="00:24:53.190" style="s2">two different views for like if you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.749" end="00:24:55.759" style="s2">a project versus if you don&#39;t i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.190" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">away on the back end to note who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.759" end="00:25:00.149" style="s2">project owner it&#39;s mostly the same i</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">think it just did it won&#39;t show you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.149" end="00:25:04.379" style="s2">projects but like you still you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:08.009" style="s2">still have events you can still have</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.379" end="00:25:12.119" style="s2">project roles you can still manage your</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.009" end="00:25:14.369" style="s2">member account one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.119" end="00:25:15.509" style="s2">still needs improvement of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.369" end="00:25:16.889" style="s2">that still needs improvement is if</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.509" end="00:25:18.749" style="s2">you&#39;re a member like going to an event</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.889" end="00:25:22.879" style="s2">being able to sort of sign up for an</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.749" end="00:25:22.879" style="s2">event easily and see if you&#39;re signed up</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.509" end="00:25:28.019" style="s2">but everything else there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.099" end="00:25:29.759" style="s2">there&#39;s ways to go at it and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.019" end="00:25:31.649" style="s2">your event roles and add them now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.759" end="00:25:34.409" style="s2">just not the most intuitive it would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.649" end="00:25:35.789" style="s2">better to have a list of events you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.409" end="00:25:36.599" style="s2">go to the event and see here&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.789" end="00:25:39.289" style="s2">signed up</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.599" end="00:25:41.969" style="s2">oh I&#39;m signed up that kind of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.289" end="00:25:44.820" style="s2">mean you have several people using this</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.969" end="00:25:46.469" style="s2">and we do have like like anything right</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.820" end="00:25:49.589" style="s2">if it&#39;s only the three of us there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.469" end="00:25:51.570" style="s2">point but if there are on four of us I</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.589" end="00:25:54.899" style="s2">guess using it only the four of us it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.570" end="00:25:56.669" style="s2">won&#39;t be much point but if we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.899" end="00:25:58.109" style="s2">multiple people using it put in an event</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.669" end="00:26:00.570" style="s2">so we can see what events are going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.109" end="00:26:02.519" style="s2">and find out what common events we want</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.570" end="00:26:04.140" style="s2">to have it can be a very very useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.519" end="00:26:06.899" style="s2">tool so thank you for making it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.140" end="00:26:08.460" style="s2">betta see if it doesn&#39;t back to get some</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.899" end="00:26:11.029" style="s2">yeah I mean clearly where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.460" end="00:26:14.250" style="s2">building for the future so right</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.029" end="00:26:16.529" style="s2">building so that also making sure that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.250" end="00:26:19.110" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have projects but are</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.529" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">interested in helping out that&#39;s a clear</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.110" end="00:26:24.120" style="s2">distinction otherwise right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.740" style="s2">why there&#39;s like a fair amount to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.120" end="00:26:27.480" style="s2">the public portions people who just</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.740" end="00:26:29.130" style="s2">wanted to kick tires they did they can</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.480" end="00:26:31.169" style="s2">show up see projects see who needs help</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.130" end="00:26:33.390" style="s2">see the events well you can even just</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.169" end="00:26:34.740" style="s2">use that to manage the event it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.390" end="00:26:37.289" style="s2">to just go there to see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.740" end="00:26:37.889" style="s2">oh it sounds cool click to view that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.289" end="00:26:39.899" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.889" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">the thing right there the only other</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.899" end="00:26:43.799" style="s2">fields that you might add to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:46.440" style="s2">project information itself would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.799" end="00:26:49.110" style="s2">perhaps something about when it started</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.440" end="00:26:51.149" style="s2">like and sort of a timeline some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.110" end="00:26:54.450" style="s2">indication of where you are with respect</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.149" end="00:26:57.960" style="s2">to what you&#39;re doing and yeah I can have</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.450" end="00:27:00.269" style="s2">that that might be useful yeah I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.960" end="00:27:01.559" style="s2">mean it&#39;ll be optional so we can you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.269" end="00:27:03.059" style="s2">know stick it on there you can fill it</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.820" end="00:28:17.050" style="s2">right post it so we could add it to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.080" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">to the pinned</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.050" end="00:28:25.870" style="s2">post although we might need to clean</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:28.510" style="s2">that up a bit to make room I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.870" end="00:28:31.930" style="s2">if there&#39;s any other place I think a pin</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.510" end="00:28:35.830" style="s2">post makes sense I&#39;m wondering if once</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.930" end="00:28:38.020" style="s2">we get sort of some decent sample data</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.830" end="00:28:39.580" style="s2">possibly even just from us if we when</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.020" end="00:28:41.650" style="s2">you want to do like a single you know a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.580" end="00:28:43.570" style="s2">one-time cross post like in the game</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.650" end="00:28:45.370" style="s2">view homepage or like you know ask Jim</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.570" end="00:28:47.710" style="s2">if we can be like hey because now that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.370" end="00:28:49.000" style="s2">kind of starts to bridge the gap of if</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.710" end="00:28:51.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a project but you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.000" end="00:28:53.380" style="s2">help with the project yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.400" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">now that community idea and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.380" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">said periodic updates from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:29:00.730" style="s2">individual groups is actually desired so</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">I think like yeah good it is the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.730" end="00:29:07.900" style="s2">meta project update is it is very yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:09.580" style="s2">game be main group right okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.900" end="00:29:11.500" style="s2">that&#39;s really important too because when</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.580" end="00:29:14.200" style="s2">I first came in I just went to the main</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.500" end="00:29:16.360" style="s2">game B page and hung out there for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.200" end="00:29:18.520" style="s2">while but then I want to do something I</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.360" end="00:29:22.620" style="s2">want to build something so then I found</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.520" end="00:29:27.640" style="s2">your page right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.620" end="00:29:29.470" style="s2">and one of the things I hinted at in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.640" end="00:29:30.940" style="s2">beginning definitely open to better</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.470" end="00:29:34.870" style="s2">names than project tracker because</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.940" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean it&#39;s kind of descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.870" end="00:29:38.560" style="s2">but also kind of vague because I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:41.470" style="s2">that one of the posts was sort of taught</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.560" end="00:29:42.730" style="s2">was more thinking I liked I think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.470" end="00:29:44.710" style="s2">person who posted thought that it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.730" end="00:29:46.270" style="s2">meant to track kind of like the game B</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.710" end="00:29:47.530" style="s2">project is in like the separate pages</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.270" end="00:29:49.150" style="s2">and they&#39;re like why wouldn&#39;t I just use</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.530" end="00:29:52.330" style="s2">the game B homepage I was like okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.150" end="00:29:57.070" style="s2">not those it&#39;s these and then banner</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.330" end="00:30:00.270" style="s2">said Africa was explained but yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.070" end="00:30:02.980" style="s2">I can&#39;t think about it clarify that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.270" end="00:30:04.930" style="s2">definitely think of each Facebook page</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.980" end="00:30:07.240" style="s2">as a project but really those are</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.930" end="00:30:08.920" style="s2">community could be like they could be in</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.240" end="00:30:10.360" style="s2">there but also they don&#39;t have like</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.920" end="00:30:12.850" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.360" end="00:30:15.070" style="s2">and they&#39;re not the only ones so I know</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.850" end="00:30:18.760" style="s2">so we posted on online tools which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.070" end="00:30:21.310" style="s2">specifically true it&#39;s great so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.760" end="00:30:25.510" style="s2">something like emerging game B projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.310" end="00:30:27.280" style="s2">yeah we once it gets my sure enough we</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.510" end="00:30:28.810" style="s2">might want to ask me wiki of about like</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.280" end="00:30:30.790" style="s2">updating the projects page to point</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.810" end="00:30:32.050" style="s2">there you like oh if you want this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.790" end="00:30:34.330" style="s2">you should be here go here instead</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.050" end="00:30:36.460" style="s2">because that&#39;s the new home for it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.330" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">yeah the wiki did it ever come back up</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:50.290" style="s2">okay so that that might be moved itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.580" end="00:30:53.020" style="s2">I think fell a part of it as projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.290" end="00:30:55.990" style="s2">and one of the things that I think will</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.020" end="00:30:58.330" style="s2">end up being an issue slash question is</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.990" end="00:31:01.690" style="s2">just like which projects how do we</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.580" end="00:32:02.920" style="s2">right and sort of a checklist do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.090" end="00:32:05.860" style="s2">feel that you fall into this category</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.920" end="00:32:08.740" style="s2">these categories which sort of broadly</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.860" end="00:32:12.790" style="s2">describe it what a game B project is if</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.740" end="00:32:17.770" style="s2">so you know make sure you join up but if</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.440" end="00:32:24.910" style="s2">a list that&#39;s kind of meant to be a hey</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.120" end="00:32:26.530" style="s2">here are some examples and not going too</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.910" end="00:32:28.270" style="s2">hard on those if you&#39;re if you&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.530" end="00:32:30.190" style="s2">kind of project go away we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.270" end="00:32:31.780" style="s2">you of course was that here&#39;s what we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.190" end="00:32:33.670" style="s2">want and then if we have people join up</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.780" end="00:32:35.350" style="s2">who have you know the Craigslist for for</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.670" end="00:32:40.210" style="s2">slaves were like okay we probably should</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.670" end="00:32:52.570" style="s2">or so not that that&#39;s sometimes easier</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.160" end="00:32:54.220" style="s2">rather than thinking of everything you</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.570" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">could possibly be like I just said about</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.220" end="00:33:01.450" style="s2">the food co-op right yeah well there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:33:02.620" style="s2">one that&#39;s absolutely suitable then if</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.850" end="00:33:38.790" style="s2">alright I think we have to add it to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.590" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">permission</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.790" end="00:33:47.770" style="s2">speaking of command and control no you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:53.140" style="s2">know yeah so this is actually not the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.770" end="00:33:55.240" style="s2">one I wanted to show but who was working</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.140" end="00:33:58.870" style="s2">on this site this is one of the options</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.240" end="00:34:01.300" style="s2">so this is Jonas or yonis his site that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.870" end="00:34:04.450" style="s2">he created to kind of help us kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.300" end="00:34:08.050" style="s2">have discussions so you would go in here</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.450" end="00:34:10.390" style="s2">and type in your name and then it shows</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.050" end="00:34:12.190" style="s2">up like these are rooms where things can</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.390" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">be happening or you could start a new</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.190" end="00:34:19.480" style="s2">one which I haven&#39;t tried which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:23.310" style="s2">actually he&#39;s got a really nice design</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.480" end="00:34:29.230" style="s2">here so let&#39;s join the ALU in Jo GI</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.310" end="00:34:31.090" style="s2">these are all tests oh yeah so yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.230" end="00:34:32.830" style="s2">think he&#39;s still kind of working on this</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.090" end="00:34:36.070" style="s2">apparently I just have the oh no</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.830" end="00:34:37.630" style="s2">something&#39;s popping up I haven&#39;t played</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.070" end="00:34:40.179" style="s2">with this it&#39;s probably a video and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.630" end="00:34:43.690" style="s2">not working because I&#39;m already using my</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.179" end="00:34:47.919" style="s2">camera and what is this built-in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.690" end="00:34:51.159" style="s2">does not know actually no it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.919" end="00:34:53.940" style="s2">not knack he&#39;s using a react as the as</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.159" end="00:34:53.940" style="s2">the framework</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.679" end="00:35:02.890" style="s2">yeah stuff like that hard coded this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.980" end="00:35:05.079" style="s2">not a drag-and-drop thing right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.890" end="00:35:07.299" style="s2">this is he&#39;s a he&#39;s doing development</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.079" end="00:35:08.740" style="s2">straight local development so that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.299" end="00:35:12.339" style="s2">kind of an idea to have a rooms where he</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.740" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">could then join and later we were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.339" end="00:35:15.670" style="s2">try and limit the number of possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">participants and I guess you could have</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.670" end="00:35:24.910" style="s2">topics based on the room name and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:29.980" style="s2">so you can delete rooms anyway so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.910" end="00:35:34.359" style="s2">where he is on that one which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.980" end="00:35:36.910" style="s2">starting jubblies initial concept and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.359" end="00:35:38.020" style="s2">correct me if i&#39;m wrong was that oh well</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.910" end="00:35:39.339" style="s2">no we talked about several different</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.020" end="00:35:40.839" style="s2">things one of them was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.339" end="00:35:43.720" style="s2">scheduling systems where you could put</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.839" end="00:35:46.539" style="s2">in your available time and and it would</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.720" end="00:35:48.520" style="s2">let you know when a group of like three</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.539" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">or four people had overlapping available</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.520" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">hours was one of the options we</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:55.119" style="s2">discussed that&#39;s not one of the options</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:36:01.029" style="s2">that I have but the other option which</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.119" end="00:36:08.740" style="s2">fits all so what shoot I forgotten his</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.029" end="00:36:10.210" style="s2">name now yeah saying that that you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.740" end="00:36:11.829" style="s2">have a place where you can see all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.210" end="00:36:13.420" style="s2">different rooms see who&#39;s in them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.829" end="00:36:16.450" style="s2">then participate which is very similar</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.420" end="00:36:19.329" style="s2">to what what Jonas was working on this</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.450" end="00:36:21.730" style="s2">is one this is called keiko chat and it</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.950" end="00:37:45.329" style="s2">this just seemed to fit exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.279" end="00:37:46.950" style="s2">Nick was talking about it&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.329" end="00:37:48.390" style="s2">could see what what people are in what</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.950" end="00:37:50.250" style="s2">rooms and join them and see what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.390" end="00:37:52.559" style="s2">talking about it doesn&#39;t have a like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.250" end="00:37:54.869" style="s2">preview of the actual video screen which</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.559" end="00:37:56.509" style="s2">is one is there a limit to the number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.869" end="00:38:01.339" style="s2">people that can be in the video room</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.509" end="00:38:05.549" style="s2">they use a zoom in the backend so oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.339" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">now so the pricing model for this is if</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.549" end="00:38:11.670" style="s2">you build it there&#39;s quite a few pricing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:15.150" style="s2">models like he has one where well I put</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.670" end="00:38:18.599" style="s2">this way you can you can actually charge</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.150" end="00:38:19.799" style="s2">people to join it&#39;s built in three month</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.599" end="00:38:21.049" style="s2">increments you can set it to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.799" end="00:38:24.869" style="s2">amount you want</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.049" end="00:38:28.890" style="s2">he then charges that central like owner</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.869" end="00:38:31.769" style="s2">of the site a number of cents per minute</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.890" end="00:38:36.210" style="s2">of video per person which is he actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.769" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">just bills you for the zoom costs so</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.210" end="00:38:39.569" style="s2">he&#39;s not making any profit off this so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:43.109" style="s2">that&#39;s what zoom charges in the back of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.569" end="00:38:45.569" style="s2">your if you&#39;re using the system so if</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.109" end="00:38:47.609" style="s2">you charge everyone three dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.569" end="00:38:49.289" style="s2">month or it be nine dollars for three</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.609" end="00:38:52.740" style="s2">months as the minimum billing cycle then</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.289" end="00:38:56.069" style="s2">you each person could do about 10 hours</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.740" end="00:38:59.519" style="s2">of video before you start going into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.069" end="00:39:02.039" style="s2">REC I was thinking if we wanted to we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.519" end="00:39:04.920" style="s2">talked about 10 hours over sorry three</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.039" end="00:39:06.509" style="s2">months or one over a months okay well 10</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.920" end="00:39:09.230" style="s2">hours per month or 30 hours and three</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.509" end="00:39:11.549" style="s2">months yeah okay is what it comes out to</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.230" end="00:39:13.710" style="s2">and then of course you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.549" end="00:39:16.380" style="s2">increase the costs if if on average</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.710" end="00:39:18.929" style="s2">everyone&#39;s doing that much</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.380" end="00:39:21.869" style="s2">so you can also charge whatever amount</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.929" end="00:39:24.149" style="s2">you want in a three-month cycle so I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.869" end="00:39:25.589" style="s2">thinking that we could do $15 for three</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.149" end="00:39:27.679" style="s2">months and have the extra money go</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.589" end="00:39:33.299" style="s2">towards funding</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.679" end="00:39:35.939" style="s2">together tech projects now we do have</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.299" end="00:39:38.819" style="s2">some of the kind of fiscal problems with</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.939" end="00:39:42.749" style="s2">that is that it&#39;ll be tied to someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.819" end="00:39:44.489" style="s2">account the one I created of course tied</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.749" end="00:39:46.589" style="s2">to my account has my credit card on it</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.489" end="00:39:50.119" style="s2">so if someone sits on video for three</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.589" end="00:39:56.039" style="s2">months then I would be built for that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.119" end="00:39:57.899" style="s2">also yeah also if any extra funds come</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.039" end="00:40:00.719" style="s2">out they would that would go to my</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.899" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">account too so we&#39;d have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.719" end="00:40:04.799" style="s2">to kind of like manage you know we had</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.209" style="s2">four people paying $15 a month and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.799" end="00:40:07.679" style="s2">is a charge and what are we doing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.209" end="00:40:10.679" style="s2">extra money how do we make sure that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.679" end="00:40:12.919" style="s2">don&#39;t just go to Cancun on it oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.679" end="00:40:12.919" style="s2">a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.069" end="00:40:18.779" style="s2">I think I did game beat yeah game bi</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.349" end="00:40:25.799" style="s2">coach at comm we could change it to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.779" end="00:40:27.539" style="s2">together techie coach at comm so this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.799" end="00:40:30.299" style="s2">just I was usually the other one is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.539" end="00:40:31.829" style="s2">demo because it there was more people in</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.299" end="00:40:33.569" style="s2">there but right now it&#39;s just me cuz no</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.829" end="00:40:36.269" style="s2">one has this and you have to create an</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.569" end="00:40:44.909" style="s2">ID and you&#39;d have to actually pay to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.269" end="00:40:46.499" style="s2">in and then yeah I mean we could make it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.909" end="00:40:49.139" style="s2">free but then I would my credit card to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.499" end="00:40:52.380" style="s2">be billed for all the video hours but</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.139" end="00:40:57.449" style="s2">all the community tools are pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.380" end="00:40:58.919" style="s2">free and it&#39;s a lot more you can do than</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.449" end="00:41:01.199" style="s2">this video chat I just want to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.919" end="00:41:02.819" style="s2">show that feature cuz that&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.199" end="00:41:05.189" style="s2">were talking about and then we can look</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.819" end="00:41:07.529" style="s2">at the other tools and see if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.189" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">more that we wanted to do anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.529" end="00:41:11.219" style="s2">that&#39;s an option it kind of fits several</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:17.099" style="s2">more ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.219" end="00:41:21.539" style="s2">what is the security level on this I I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.099" end="00:41:24.779" style="s2">mean I know the developer and choosing</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.539" end="00:41:27.649" style="s2">zoom is the backend so owned by Google</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.779" end="00:41:29.110" style="s2">now is that true that&#39;s what I heard I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.649" end="00:41:32.680" style="s2">have not</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.110" end="00:41:34.540" style="s2">that you don&#39;t know I know they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.680" end="00:41:39.250" style="s2">getting in a lot of security related</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.540" end="00:41:40.750" style="s2">trouble recently but yeah ya know most</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.250" end="00:41:43.090" style="s2">of their security related trouble was</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.750" end="00:41:46.780" style="s2">because they overstated their security</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.090" end="00:41:49.660" style="s2">stance it&#39;s and then you know people</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.780" end="00:41:51.880" style="s2">were kind of getting in and because</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.660" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">they&#39;re you know people are able to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.880" end="00:41:55.000" style="s2">into your video and stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:58.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.000" end="00:42:00.850" style="s2">health-related we don&#39;t the we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.900" end="00:42:02.440" style="s2">be doing anything in here I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.850" end="00:42:03.820" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to be public like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.440" end="00:42:05.800" style="s2">don&#39;t want people taking videos of you</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.820" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">talking and private and going out but</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.800" end="00:42:11.260" style="s2">there shouldn&#39;t be an API a PII our pH I</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:13.990" style="s2">in this platform at all right sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.260" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">I think they were also sending even if</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.990" end="00:42:18.130" style="s2">you didn&#39;t have a Facebook account they</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:20.140" style="s2">were sending information about the like</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.130" end="00:42:22.570" style="s2">the meetings and stuff I guess that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.140" end="00:42:24.460" style="s2">learned to Facebook now you guys stop</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.570" end="00:42:28.630" style="s2">that but they&#39;re they gotten some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.460" end="00:42:31.300" style="s2">hot water yeah correct the tool you</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.630" end="00:42:34.180" style="s2">showed near the beginning with it yonas</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.300" end="00:42:38.710" style="s2">it made mm-hmm how much did you know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.180" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">price point on that one weather no</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.710" end="00:42:42.340" style="s2">Aussie onus and whether it like if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:45.100" style="s2">are using it how much it cost the person</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.340" end="00:42:47.860" style="s2">and then how much we would pay for that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.100" end="00:42:52.510" style="s2">because that is like one cent per minute</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.860" end="00:42:54.700" style="s2">per person doesn&#39;t seem like a like I</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.510" end="00:42:56.020" style="s2">know when I was using stream yard I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.700" end="00:42:57.880" style="s2">just setting up conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.020" end="00:43:00.430" style="s2">people in game it was hard to stay under</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.880" end="00:43:03.160" style="s2">20 hours a month and that was only two</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.430" end="00:43:05.020" style="s2">of us right not like if you have ten</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.160" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">people and four people are watching and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.020" end="00:43:08.650" style="s2">six people are having a conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:10.120" style="s2">four people still count and it&#39;s it can</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.650" end="00:43:14.860" style="s2">get rather astronomically expensive</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.120" end="00:43:16.630" style="s2">especially um anyway yes like $15 for</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.860" end="00:43:18.070" style="s2">three months seems like a doable I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.630" end="00:43:20.290" style="s2">sign up for that but I know that&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.070" end="00:43:22.150" style="s2">sticking point for a lot of people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.290" end="00:43:25.360" style="s2">I&#39;m if there is a way for us to start</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.150" end="00:43:27.700" style="s2">for free or for cheap or for by donation</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.360" end="00:43:29.260" style="s2">where you don&#39;t I mean if this costs him</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.700" end="00:43:30.700" style="s2">a hundred bucks a month that actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.260" end="00:43:32.620" style="s2">seems better than one cents a minute</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.700" end="00:43:35.530" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s like you know like per person</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.620" end="00:43:38.440" style="s2">for like I&#39;m just wondering I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.530" end="00:43:40.090" style="s2">think his the video on his solution is</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.440" end="00:43:42.109" style="s2">gonna have any different pricing models</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.090" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">and between the two solutions for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.109" end="00:43:49.130" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s going into the back</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:51.259" style="s2">ends it is I&#39;m sorry so it&#39;s a zoom API</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.130" end="00:43:52.940" style="s2">that people are plugging in I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.259" end="00:43:55.069" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what&#39;s it the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.940" end="00:43:58.190" style="s2">one I don&#39;t know what yonus to chose</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.069" end="00:44:01.549" style="s2">here and I you know I could probably try</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.190" end="00:44:03.319" style="s2">and figure it out but again yeah I can I</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.549" end="00:44:04.940" style="s2">can ask him ask him if he knows the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.319" end="00:44:07.039" style="s2">price point I&#39;m so I wasn&#39;t aware that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.940" end="00:44:09.049" style="s2">this particular one was also zoom I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.039" end="00:44:14.059" style="s2">thought it was just a text chat so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.049" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">I think that was his intent I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.059" end="00:44:18.380" style="s2">how far he got and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:24.230" style="s2">actually see any controls coming up so</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.380" end="00:44:25.640" style="s2">maybe he hasn&#39;t even put that in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.230" end="00:44:27.499" style="s2">thing to see if I can look in so I I</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.640" end="00:44:29.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know how far he&#39;s gotten I just</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.499" end="00:44:31.220" style="s2">know he had like owner first talking it</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.720" end="00:44:32.569" style="s2">wasn&#39;t even important to have a oh it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.220" end="00:44:33.829" style="s2">was just helping people get together and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.569" end="00:44:36.589" style="s2">then they would have to figure out their</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.829" end="00:44:43.609" style="s2">video issues so you know they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.589" end="00:44:49.190" style="s2">limited to 45 minutes well it has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.609" end="00:44:52.099" style="s2">of notes coming back in here we are able</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.190" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">to use zooms free option and just key</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.099" end="00:44:55.220" style="s2">because you can use the URL we use it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:44:56.869" style="s2">for a mega group all the time we just</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.220" end="00:44:59.450" style="s2">click on the same one constant we just</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.869" end="00:45:00.920" style="s2">go out and come back in that it&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.450" end="00:45:03.980" style="s2">like the group whether they want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.920" end="00:45:05.920" style="s2">for a user account or not rather than at</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.980" end="00:45:08.630" style="s2">all because if you&#39;re going with zoom</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:10.940" style="s2">embedded in your technology then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.630" end="00:45:13.400" style="s2">always 1 cent per minute per user and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.940" end="00:45:18.230" style="s2">you can&#39;t really get the free option or</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.400" end="00:45:20.650" style="s2">the like group option right where you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.230" end="00:45:23.359" style="s2">pay 20 bucks a month for unlimited or</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.650" end="00:45:26.690" style="s2">whereas if we like if there is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.359" end="00:45:28.039" style="s2">embed that in this then we get the best</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.690" end="00:45:29.480" style="s2">of both worlds but I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.039" end="00:45:34.430" style="s2">Jonas has done or whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.480" end="00:45:35.749" style="s2">possible or any of it so I will I&#39;ll ask</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.430" end="00:45:39.230" style="s2">you a nice the pricing on it because</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.749" end="00:45:40.759" style="s2">that&#39;s just yeah now the with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.230" end="00:45:43.549" style="s2">benefit of going with this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.759" end="00:45:46.549" style="s2">is that is that we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.549" end="00:45:50.390" style="s2">having a way to have people contribute</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.549" end="00:45:52.249" style="s2">monthly to this and I don&#39;t think</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.249" end="00:45:55.450" style="s2">costs would go above</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.500" end="00:45:59.290" style="s2">unless we have a bad actor like we said</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.670" end="00:46:00.850" style="s2">and then we kick that person out but I</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.290" end="00:46:03.250" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s a chance that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.850" end="00:46:04.870" style="s2">video costs would go above and we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.250" end="00:46:06.430" style="s2">make it ever one you know it could be</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.740" end="00:46:12.640" style="s2">could be anything but then we do have</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.900" end="00:46:32.770" style="s2">do that with that these other systems</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.450" end="00:46:35.080" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.770" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">so yella stood then have to set up a</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.330" end="00:46:46.630" style="s2">now it&#39;s not as flexible as I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.100" end="00:46:47.550" style="s2">be nice if we could send people and give</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.630" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">them a free month</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.550" end="00:46:53.320" style="s2">yeah the trial which I can I can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:55.270" style="s2">them and see if we can get that type of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.320" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">stuff put it I have a plague yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.270" end="00:46:58.510" style="s2">nak also has some built in some building</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.970" end="00:47:06.520" style="s2">that and then if we wanted to do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.330" end="00:47:08.800" style="s2">patreon beltzman option like four</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.520" end="00:47:11.800" style="s2">together tech just to do like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:13.330" style="s2">monthly donation days but then that</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.800" end="00:47:15.190" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t be related to Kiko</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.330" end="00:47:16.450" style="s2">chat that would just be to fund whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.190" end="00:47:18.730" style="s2">way and I&#39;m doing with it whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.450" end="00:47:22.840" style="s2">Kiko chat or custom development or what</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.730" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s the issue with getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.840" end="00:47:26.380" style="s2">the funds moved around to the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:29.500" style="s2">place yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.380" end="00:47:31.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s I not sure how the name</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.500" end="00:47:32.620" style="s2">alignment works technically wiki</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.180" end="00:47:35.020" style="s2">election is incorporated and has a bank</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.620" end="00:47:36.370" style="s2">account so I mean if we&#39;re just wanting</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.020" end="00:47:41.260" style="s2">to like keep it out of people&#39;s personal</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.370" end="00:47:43.540" style="s2">accounts I mean then it&#39;s getting named</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.540" end="00:47:47.650" style="s2">still like the tracking part which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.580" end="00:47:49.360" style="s2">definitely not signing up for cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.650" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">not a big fan of accounting and all that</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.360" end="00:47:53.320" style="s2">jazz but just saying like if the you</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:54.970" style="s2">know we&#39;re trying to keep it out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.320" end="00:47:57.610" style="s2">people&#39;s personal accounts for text</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.970" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">stuff like that that&#39;s why I set up with</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.610" end="00:48:01.330" style="s2">you and I think the point where we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.190" style="s2">multiplied right now stream yard works</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.330" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">for us to have our conversations right</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.190" end="00:48:07.360" style="s2">because there&#39;s under six of us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:07.859" style="s2">once we you can even go on to zoom and</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.859" end="00:48:11.549" style="s2">more about the coordination and doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:13.650" style="s2">those things I like I really like yonis</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.549" end="00:48:15.809" style="s2">is one I also really like keepo chat but</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.650" end="00:48:17.609" style="s2">it&#39;s Jonas this one is even more it</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.809" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">feels to be more intuitive more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.609" end="00:48:21.989" style="s2">like oh it&#39;s just a list of rooms I can</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:23.489" style="s2">join rather than the other one looks I</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.989" end="00:48:25.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know it was felt less like yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.489" end="00:48:27.269" style="s2">it&#39;s not trying to be a full ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.410" end="00:48:33.329" style="s2">it&#39;s just really Purpose Driven just one</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.269" end="00:48:35.940" style="s2">thing jet c.org which they say is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.329" end="00:48:39.029" style="s2">completely free video conferencing so he</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.940" end="00:48:41.369" style="s2">may have found an option that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.029" end="00:48:44.369" style="s2">free sounds good and then like was well</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.369" end="00:48:48.410" style="s2">funny tell you until we need money right</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.369" end="00:48:52.170" style="s2">like I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.410" end="00:48:54.059" style="s2">free is very bad free services is bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.170" end="00:48:56.009" style="s2">game AAA not necessarily game P because</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.059" end="00:49:00.950" style="s2">they&#39;re not giving it to you out of well</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.009" end="00:49:00.950" style="s2">rank like why is it freeze a question</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.210" end="00:49:06.809" style="s2">saying the farm we&#39;re getting money from</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:08.789" style="s2">people the only is like transparency on</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.809" end="00:49:09.749" style="s2">why are we asking for money where is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.789" end="00:49:11.400" style="s2">going and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.749" end="00:49:12.930" style="s2">problem with this costs us nine dollars</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.400" end="00:49:14.670" style="s2">every three months we&#39;re getting 15 to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.930" end="00:49:16.710" style="s2">six is going into here what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.670" end="00:49:18.630" style="s2">with that we don&#39;t know yet we&#39;ll know</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.710" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">in the future the other issue is little</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.630" end="00:49:22.799" style="s2">logistics of we need a bank account or</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:24.239" style="s2">together tech and there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.799" end="00:49:28.170" style="s2">signers and we have to figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.239" end="00:49:30.089" style="s2">and do do that portion of it which at</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.170" end="00:49:31.829" style="s2">the moment probably makes sense that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.089" end="00:49:33.720" style="s2">jury just because Pedro and I are both</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.829" end="00:49:36.119" style="s2">in this like we need to people that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.720" end="00:49:38.130" style="s2">signers in the same logistical location</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.119" end="00:49:40.920" style="s2">so but even then we&#39;re actually not that</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.130" end="00:49:42.509" style="s2">question if we can get three we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.920" end="00:49:48.869" style="s2">incorporate as a society and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.509" end="00:49:50.309" style="s2">there&#39;s no tax third BC person like</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.869" end="00:49:51.779" style="s2">that&#39;s the point is like you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.309" end="00:49:54.089" style="s2">people all over the states and canada</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.779" end="00:49:55.710" style="s2">and australia and like all these things</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.089" end="00:49:57.180" style="s2">aren&#39;t designed for another canadian</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.710" end="00:49:59.160" style="s2">might be okay i think you have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.180" end="00:50:02.099" style="s2">majority BBC but i think it actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.160" end="00:50:03.900" style="s2">might be okay for them to be i yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.099" end="00:50:08.700" style="s2">think i think i believe it&#39;s over half</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.900" end="00:50:10.380" style="s2">has to be in DC for a busy society and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.700" end="00:50:11.700" style="s2">technically we could do a federal one</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.380" end="00:50:13.589" style="s2">but that&#39;s just a bit harder on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.700" end="00:50:15.239" style="s2">paperwork side but it&#39;s just like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.589" end="00:50:17.339" style="s2">logistics of we need money to go into</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.239" end="00:50:19.890" style="s2">account we need accounting and then the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.339" end="00:50:21.480" style="s2">actual transparency of here&#39;s a rat this</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.890" end="00:50:23.220" style="s2">is why we&#39;re asking for money this works</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.480" end="00:50:25.800" style="s2">and it needs easy the spreadsheet right</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.220" end="00:50:27.600" style="s2">like yes we thought we would have this</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.800" end="00:50:28.920" style="s2">much zoom time we&#39;ve actually is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.600" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">much we&#39;re in the red that we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.920" end="00:50:34.380" style="s2">green were it you know like showing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:37.770" style="s2">this is the case instead of just being</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.380" end="00:50:42.450" style="s2">transparent which to me is very how we</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.770" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">get to Game B is through that around</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.450" end="00:50:45.390" style="s2">that time is probably what when we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">start getting deeper into the what would</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.390" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">you need to trust an organization that</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">was you know doing the kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:52.350" style="s2">that we say we&#39;re doing and standing for</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:55.080" style="s2">what we say we stand for what does that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.350" end="00:50:57.540" style="s2">mean you know you trust us or don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.080" end="00:50:59.250" style="s2">trust me a lot yeah one other options I</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.540" end="00:51:01.470" style="s2">don&#39;t know how hard it could get to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.250" end="00:51:02.850" style="s2">set up as if we could get into hope and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.470" end="00:51:06.750" style="s2">collective which is mostly for</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.850" end="00:51:08.730" style="s2">open-source software but they they end</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.750" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">up being the fiduciary it&#39;s their bank</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.730" end="00:51:14.520" style="s2">account and then as people do things you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:17.670" style="s2">submit an invoice and that invoice is</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.520" end="00:51:19.170" style="s2">all tracked and it&#39;s all open source so</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.670" end="00:51:21.210" style="s2">anyone can then look and see where the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.170" end="00:51:22.890" style="s2">funds are going anyone can submit an</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.210" end="00:51:24.900" style="s2">invoice and then we would approve so</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.890" end="00:51:26.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no tax issue so there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.900" end="00:51:28.770" style="s2">fully open source I&#39;d be great the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.550" end="00:51:30.780" style="s2">problem is usually you have to have an</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.770" end="00:51:33.090" style="s2">open source software project although</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.780" end="00:51:34.170" style="s2">they say they handle other stuff anyway</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.090" end="00:51:35.880" style="s2">so if we&#39;re going to spend time looking</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.170" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">into it I would I would include that as</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.880" end="00:51:41.700" style="s2">well because that sounds a lot easier if</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:43.380" style="s2">we can get past their hurdle yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.700" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">that sounds like a good a very good</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.380" end="00:51:46.680" style="s2">option I think we looked into it before</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">yeah seemed like the most viable option</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.680" end="00:51:52.680" style="s2">although like this tool we looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.920" end="00:51:56.310" style="s2">one Adriel did isn&#39;t open source right</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.680" end="00:51:57.930" style="s2">like it also is like our intention is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.310" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">make one that is open source at some</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.930" end="00:52:00.930" style="s2">point in time it&#39;s just not there yet</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.220" end="00:52:02.490" style="s2">and we&#39;re using the tools of our ability</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.930" end="00:52:03.810" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if they care about that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.490" end="00:52:06.420" style="s2">right I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s under there</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.810" end="00:52:08.520" style="s2">Brock receivers no yeah yonis is one as</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.420" end="00:52:11.880" style="s2">technically open source he it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.520" end="00:52:13.859" style="s2">on github and anyone can see it so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.880" end="00:52:16.170" style="s2">could put that under a group name of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.859" end="00:52:18.119" style="s2">together tech and github and then apply</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.170" end="00:52:19.950" style="s2">but normally you need over a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.119" end="00:52:22.170" style="s2">people they used to have it they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.950" end="00:52:23.790" style="s2">changed the website some a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.170" end="00:52:31.380" style="s2">people start the project before they</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.790" end="00:52:34.560" style="s2">even look at it but projects there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.380" end="00:52:35.130" style="s2">always the option like and game B itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.560" end="00:52:37.470" style="s2">but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.130" end="00:52:39.240" style="s2">like I don&#39;t could I go and store it do</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.470" end="00:52:40.980" style="s2">I have to be a coder or be someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.240" end="00:52:43.050" style="s2">actually technically you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.980" end="00:52:44.580" style="s2">create an account at github and store it</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.050" end="00:52:46.190" style="s2">I think although if they look at that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.580" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole bunch of non developers</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.190" end="00:52:51.300" style="s2">and I want to but I want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:53.130" style="s2">that we&#39;re we&#39;re doing it it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.300" end="00:52:54.690" style="s2">for open source software but I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.130" end="00:52:56.610" style="s2">they also had it for open source</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.690" end="00:53:01.070" style="s2">software or nonprofits so even though</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.610" end="00:53:03.690" style="s2">we&#39;re technically not eat either we fit</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.070" end="00:53:05.460" style="s2">the goal of what they&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.690" end="00:53:09.060" style="s2">it&#39;s just whether they would believe us</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.460" end="00:53:12.390" style="s2">or not yeah and I mean if we</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.060" end="00:53:20.430" style="s2">incorporated as a society I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.390" end="00:53:21.660" style="s2">arguable nonprofit and then were ours</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.430" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">probably good time to mention that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.660" end="00:53:24.750" style="s2">will not be here tomorrow with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:27.120" style="s2">Saturday morning conversation I did</p>

<p begin="00:54:56.950" end="00:55:00.220" style="s2">the starting point of the conversation</p>

<p begin="00:55:00.220" end="00:55:04.210" style="s2">interrelated that&#39;s why it has these</p>
