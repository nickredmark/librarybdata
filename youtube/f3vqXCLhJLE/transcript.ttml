<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:13.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working for the last few days</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">on the 8th lecture in my series the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.380" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">psychological significance of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">biblical stories and I&#39;m planning to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:21.330" style="s2">talk about the Abrahamic stories that</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:23.609" style="s2">immediately follow the stories of Noah</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.330" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">and the Tower of Babel I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.609" end="00:00:28.590" style="s2">familiar with Abrahamic stories as I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">with the stories the earlier stories in</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">Genesis say from the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">Bible through the stories of Noah and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">the Tower of Babel and I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">familiar with the Abrahamic stories as I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">am with the stories of Moses that begin</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">with Exodus and continue in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">succeeding chapters so I&#39;ve had to do a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:48.600" style="s2">lot of reading and a lot of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:50.460" style="s2">and some conversing as well and as part</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">of that process I spoke once again with</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.460" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">Jonathan Paola a Carver of stone icons</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:01:00.539" style="s2">and an Orthodox Christian and student of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">religion and also this time who I did a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.539" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">video with a while back you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">remember called the metaphysics of Pepe</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:07.830" style="s2">where we discussed the psychology of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.049" style="s2">stranger and also some of the stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.830" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">gaybraham ik stories involving lot in</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.049" end="00:01:13.710" style="s2">Sodom and Gomorrah and I also had the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">opportunity to meet his brother Matthew</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.710" end="00:01:17.490" style="s2">pazzo who&#39;s been working on a book on</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">the Bible for the last three and a half</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.490" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">years and so we spent 90 minutes talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">about the Abrahamic stories and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">conceptual background that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">to understand them and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">wanted to show you today after this</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">introduction so I hope it&#39;s useful so</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">I&#39;m going to introduce both of you so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">Jonathan is a carver of icons and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">spoken with Jonathan a number of times</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:45.000" style="s2">already and he now has his own YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">channel as well where he discusses</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.000" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">issues that are similar to the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">we&#39;re going to discuss today and Matthew</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">is his brother who I haven&#39;t met before</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">this day and Matthew has been working on</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">a book for the last how long you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">here three and a half years and do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">want to tell everyone very briefly about</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">the book well it&#39;s a book about</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">symbolism but it is basically I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:12.700" style="s2">to rediscover the worldview that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">present in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.700" end="00:02:16.870" style="s2">the time of the Bible or at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:19.930" style="s2">actually not that long ago because</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.870" end="00:02:21.550" style="s2">modern modern interpretations of reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.930" end="00:02:22.840" style="s2">materialist interpretations of reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.550" end="00:02:26.050" style="s2">aren&#39;t that old</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:28.680" style="s2">right the worldview that was there when</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.050" end="00:02:32.530" style="s2">traditional societies were still there</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.680" end="00:02:37.030" style="s2">and so I&#39;m trying to rediscover that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.530" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">worldview and basically there are basic</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.030" end="00:02:42.849" style="s2">patterns have an inner time and space</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.959" end="00:02:44.769" style="s2">things like things like that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.849" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">like a cosmology that&#39;s been completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.769" end="00:02:50.110" style="s2">lost as far as I&#39;m concern people have</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:53.530" style="s2">glimpses of it I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.110" end="00:02:56.170" style="s2">do but it&#39;s very general patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.530" end="00:02:57.670" style="s2">we have to re re understand so we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.170" end="00:02:59.500" style="s2">understand the Bible for example in</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.670" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">other other societies so there are did</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.500" end="00:03:06.340" style="s2">you get interested in this like what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:07.750" style="s2">it that&#39;s compelled you to do this oh I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.340" end="00:03:10.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know where to start I mean my</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.750" end="00:03:12.519" style="s2">whole life has been about that so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.510" end="00:03:14.170" style="s2">you read the Bible you can take it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.519" end="00:03:16.209" style="s2">literally you can take it figuratively</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.170" end="00:03:17.470" style="s2">or you can take it both ways and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.209" end="00:03:19.900" style="s2">trying to take it both ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:24.340" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get rid of that dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.900" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">the dichotomy of symbolism and factual</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.340" end="00:03:28.810" style="s2">description I think there is no such</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">htech otta me if you understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.810" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">words mean if you have the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:36.790" style="s2">perspective there&#39;s no more metaphors in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:38.170" style="s2">the Bible there are none okay but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.790" end="00:03:40.540" style="s2">takes a while to get there because you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.170" end="00:03:43.180" style="s2">have to adopt a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.540" end="00:03:45.069" style="s2">perspective than a materialistic one</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.180" end="00:03:48.370" style="s2">obviously it can be a materialist and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.069" end="00:03:49.780" style="s2">and a Christian or it can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.370" end="00:03:51.790" style="s2">religious and immaterial that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.780" end="00:03:53.350" style="s2">think okay and one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.790" end="00:03:54.489" style="s2">hoping is that you know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.350" end="00:03:55.989" style="s2">getting I&#39;ve been getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.489" end="00:03:57.700" style="s2">questions and I know you&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.989" end="00:03:59.889" style="s2">Jordan me getting a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.700" end="00:04:01.959" style="s2">about this question of metaphor and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.889" end="00:04:04.329" style="s2">lot of people have been asking me how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.959" end="00:04:06.190" style="s2">we reconcile how do i reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.329" end="00:04:08.349" style="s2">metaphors with what&#39;s in the Bible how</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.190" end="00:04:09.880" style="s2">do i reconcile these metaphors with how</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.349" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">I&#39;m supposed to live in the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.880" end="00:04:13.239" style="s2">think that what Matthew has been rough</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.530" style="s2">with is writing and what I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.239" end="00:04:17.560" style="s2">been reading it right I&#39;m reading it</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.530" end="00:04:19.180" style="s2">right now is that he he&#39;s really able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.560" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">answer that question in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.180" end="00:04:24.070" style="s2">think will be one of the most satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:26.230" style="s2">answers that we&#39;ve seen in a while so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.070" end="00:04:28.870" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty excited to see how</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.230" end="00:04:30.850" style="s2">going to get that out to people so let</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.870" end="00:04:33.490" style="s2">me start by telling you what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.850" end="00:04:35.470" style="s2">thinking about just briefly and then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.490" end="00:04:36.850" style="s2">guys can comment and I&#39;d like you to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.470" end="00:04:38.530" style="s2">most of the talking if we can manage</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.850" end="00:04:42.180" style="s2">that although I&#39;m so damn talkative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.530" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">hard to imagine that will happen but so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.180" end="00:04:47.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve been reading this book called the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:49.720" style="s2">disappearance of God and I&#39;ve been using</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.500" end="00:04:51.340" style="s2">it as a - by a guy named Richard</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.720" end="00:04:55.030" style="s2">Friedman and it was published I think in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.340" end="00:04:58.690" style="s2">2005 I think that&#39;s right it might have</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.030" end="00:05:01.330" style="s2">been earlier than that but he makes a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.690" end="00:05:03.910" style="s2">couple of interesting points about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.330" end="00:05:06.130" style="s2">old abrading in the Old Testament and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.910" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">and they&#39;re parallel points and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.130" end="00:05:11.140" style="s2">first is that the closer you are to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:16.120" style="s2">beginning of the Bible the more God is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.140" end="00:05:19.450" style="s2">present and and as you progress towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.120" end="00:05:22.030" style="s2">the end of the Old Testament God sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.450" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">vanishes in stages until he only</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.030" end="00:05:29.710" style="s2">manifests himself if at all in prophetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:31.870" style="s2">visions and at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.710" end="00:05:34.120" style="s2">parallel development is that the stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">of individual human beings become more</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.120" end="00:05:38.740" style="s2">and more well developed so it&#39;s like as</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:40.690" style="s2">the idea of the individual personality</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.740" end="00:05:43.630" style="s2">emerges or the fact of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.690" end="00:05:48.250" style="s2">personality emerges to the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.630" end="00:05:51.310" style="s2">God as a as a detectable entity like an</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.250" end="00:05:52.270" style="s2">external entity even seems to decline</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.310" end="00:05:55.960" style="s2">proportionately</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.270" end="00:05:58.620" style="s2">and so I&#39;m trying to puzzle that out in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.960" end="00:06:01.150" style="s2">a variety of different ways partly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.620" end="00:06:04.810" style="s2">neurologically because there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.150" end="00:06:06.580" style="s2">evidence that the domain of experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.810" end="00:06:09.730" style="s2">that you might associate it with might</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.580" end="00:06:11.950" style="s2">associate with the divine is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.730" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">consequence of suppressed lemmas left</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.950" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">hemisphere function and augmented right</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:19.960" style="s2">hemisphere function and then I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2">to also consider that in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.960" end="00:06:24.370" style="s2">the effect of chemicals like psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:27.010" style="s2">which obviously can produce powerful</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.370" end="00:06:28.180" style="s2">mystical experiences so experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.010" end="00:06:30.070" style="s2">consciousness that are really of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.180" end="00:06:33.820" style="s2">different type than normal waking ego</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.070" end="00:06:37.510" style="s2">consciousness and I&#39;ve also been reading</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.820" end="00:06:39.699" style="s2">Jung&#39;s mostly commentaries about Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.510" end="00:06:43.629" style="s2">red book and his attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.699" end="00:06:46.629" style="s2">use active imagination as a as a means</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.629" end="00:06:47.919" style="s2">to explore the contents of different</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.629" end="00:06:50.199" style="s2">forms of consciousness which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.919" end="00:06:52.810" style="s2">something that modern people just really</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.199" end="00:06:55.029" style="s2">never do although he did it for years</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.810" end="00:06:57.789" style="s2">and and the consequence of that was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.029" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">red book also the black books which</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.789" end="00:07:01.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t been published yet but the red</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:03.819" style="s2">book which was a which was I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.960" end="00:07:05.529" style="s2">published two or three years ago it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.819" end="00:07:08.020" style="s2">a collection of visionary experiences</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.529" end="00:07:10.599" style="s2">and his his continuing discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.020" end="00:07:12.189" style="s2">figures of his imagination which he</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.599" end="00:07:16.029" style="s2">regarded as the most important work he</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.189" end="00:07:19.900" style="s2">did in his life so so what&#39;s what does</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.029" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">that all boil down to it it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.900" end="00:07:26.349" style="s2">possible for people to have none can</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:27.870" style="s2">happen to have experiences outside the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.349" end="00:07:31.930" style="s2">domain of their normal consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.870" end="00:07:34.839" style="s2">that produce the intimation of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.930" end="00:07:39.099" style="s2">divine that seems to be factually</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.839" end="00:07:41.379" style="s2">indisputable those we&#39;re not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.099" end="00:07:43.270" style="s2">sure how those experiences manifested</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.379" end="00:07:44.830" style="s2">themselves in the periods of time that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.270" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">are associated with the early biblical</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.830" end="00:07:51.009" style="s2">stories the bit the Bible talks about</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:53.319" style="s2">those sorts of experiences very</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.009" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">forthrightly in the earliest Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.319" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">stories and also in the story of Noah</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:58.569" style="s2">and obviously in Adam and Eve and all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:00.729" style="s2">that God&#39;s very present and then he</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.569" end="00:08:04.810" style="s2">disappears over time and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.729" end="00:08:06.699" style="s2">things that that the guy who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.810" end="00:08:10.870" style="s2">disappearance of God Freedman one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.699" end="00:08:12.430" style="s2">things he pointed out was that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.870" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">of the disappearance of God in the Old</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.430" end="00:08:20.409" style="s2">Testament the fact that that&#39;s an air</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:23.229" style="s2">that&#39;s a continual like it has narrative</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.409" end="00:08:24.729" style="s2">continuity that fact he really remarked</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.229" end="00:08:25.930" style="s2">on both those things because of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.729" end="00:08:27.580" style="s2">the books were written by different</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.930" end="00:08:29.740" style="s2">people and then they were aggregated but</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.580" end="00:08:31.479" style="s2">out of that came two elements of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.740" end="00:08:33.010" style="s2">narrative continuity and one was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.479" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">gradual disappearance of God and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.010" end="00:08:36.519" style="s2">other was the gradual rise of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:43.630" style="s2">increasingly well-defined and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.519" end="00:08:47.170" style="s2">individual so anyways associated with</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.630" end="00:08:49.810" style="s2">that is the idea that as God withdraws</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.170" end="00:08:51.700" style="s2">he also starts to manifest himself more</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.810" end="00:08:53.590" style="s2">through the idea of a covenant</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.700" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">and that the Covenant is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.590" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">that&#39;s established with an individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:58.810" style="s2">it&#39;s all obviously also with the nation</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:02.740" style="s2">in the case of Israel but it&#39;s mediated</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">through individuals and so well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.740" end="00:09:08.620" style="s2">brief wander through the sort of cloud</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:13.210" style="s2">of associations that make up my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.620" end="00:09:15.190" style="s2">about the topic at the moment so well</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.210" end="00:09:17.470" style="s2">with what you described it sounds a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.190" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">like what would you see in the Bible I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.470" end="00:09:21.910" style="s2">not so sure about the God is more</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:25.390" style="s2">distant part where in further on and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.910" end="00:09:28.390" style="s2">goes from what I understand there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.390" end="00:09:31.900" style="s2">two kinds of consciousness in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.390" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">one of them is it&#39;s called inhabiting</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.900" end="00:09:40.780" style="s2">the land that&#39;s when reality fits the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:43.840" style="s2">best of the theory okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.780" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">principles and the facts agree so there</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.840" end="00:09:49.300" style="s2">are laws and people follow the laws okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:51.910" style="s2">or there&#39;s an idea and reality fits with</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.300" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">that idea so that&#39;s called inhabiting</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.910" end="00:09:59.950" style="s2">the land so it&#39;s familiar space okay so</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:03.070" style="s2">when you live in that space things make</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.950" end="00:10:05.530" style="s2">sense because your idea is match what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.070" end="00:10:08.080" style="s2">happened free and then you can fall away</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.530" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">from that and that&#39;s the Covenant okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.080" end="00:10:13.330" style="s2">covenant is an agreement between theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:18.490" style="s2">and practice that&#39;s what a covenant is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.330" end="00:10:21.190" style="s2">in the Bible so God gives laws and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.490" end="00:10:24.940" style="s2">people have to agree to follow basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.190" end="00:10:27.810" style="s2">so the law is is is an identity it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.940" end="00:10:32.080" style="s2">just you do this you do that this it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.810" end="00:10:35.410" style="s2">expresses God&#39;s identity in practice so</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.080" end="00:10:39.790" style="s2">when the facts match that identity</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.410" end="00:10:41.070" style="s2">that&#39;s like a soul and a body that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.790" end="00:10:45.790" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.070" end="00:10:47.980" style="s2">not agree okay so when you fall away</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.790" end="00:10:51.060" style="s2">from that you fall into exile that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.980" end="00:10:52.660" style="s2">other mode yeah and it looks like and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.060" end="00:10:54.580" style="s2">that&#39;s what you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.660" end="00:10:59.380" style="s2">before I&#39;m not so sure until you talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.580" end="00:11:02.200" style="s2">about a covenant but that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.380" end="00:11:04.330" style="s2">meaning ends the facts do not match okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.200" end="00:11:05.350" style="s2">so let me ask you a couple of questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.330" end="00:11:08.350" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.350" end="00:11:12.550" style="s2">yeah so you know I&#39;ve been describing</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.350" end="00:11:15.400" style="s2">the cosmology in the Bible as mapable</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:17.260" style="s2">onto the domains of order and chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.400" end="00:11:19.860" style="s2">I actually think the best way to define</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.260" end="00:11:22.150" style="s2">order is order is the place you are when</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.860" end="00:11:25.180" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing matches what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.150" end="00:11:26.860" style="s2">happening yes very very very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.180" end="00:11:28.120" style="s2">the idea that you just expressed and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.860" end="00:11:30.520" style="s2">then that&#39;s exactly it</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.120" end="00:11:31.950" style="s2">okay okay and yeah that&#39;s a state</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.520" end="00:11:34.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a state of harmony between</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.950" end="00:11:36.610" style="s2">preconception and actuality and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.600" end="00:11:38.290" style="s2">also I think this the circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.610" end="00:11:40.120" style="s2">under which people&#39;s emotions remain</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.290" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">regulated and I thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.120" end="00:11:43.810" style="s2">neurologically too I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:45.880" style="s2">happens is that under those conditions</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.810" end="00:11:48.400" style="s2">you&#39;re left hemisphere stays in charge</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.880" end="00:11:49.630" style="s2">and there&#39;s some evidence for that kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.400" end="00:11:53.140" style="s2">of thing too especially from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.630" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2">writings of this neurologist I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.140" end="00:11:57.790" style="s2">he&#39;s a neurologist his name is Rama</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.790" end="00:12:00.570" style="s2">Chandra he&#39;s quite a famous brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.790" end="00:12:02.560" style="s2">scientist and he&#39;s oh and another</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.570" end="00:12:04.180" style="s2">another neuropsychologist named</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">Belconnen Goldberg who&#39;s also talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.180" end="00:12:07.900" style="s2">about hemispheric function in the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">way and so when things are going</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.900" end="00:12:12.040" style="s2">according to plan</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:14.500" style="s2">let&#39;s say yes you&#39;re in red and then the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.040" end="00:12:19.180" style="s2">individual ego consciousness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.500" end="00:12:21.010" style="s2">that&#39;s focused and specific stays in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.180" end="00:12:23.170" style="s2">charge but that also keeps negative</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.010" end="00:12:24.730" style="s2">emotions regulated because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.170" end="00:12:26.740" style="s2">need for them because everything is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.730" end="00:12:28.300" style="s2">working properly and so then you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.740" end="00:12:32.500" style="s2">fall out of that and you called that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.300" end="00:12:33.880" style="s2">call that exile not when you follow it</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.500" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">for me yeah yeah when you follow it by</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.880" end="00:12:37.990" style="s2">the XS so that would be a quest all so</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:40.270" style="s2">the flood it&#39;s also the slide yeah fine</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.990" end="00:12:44.830" style="s2">okay so the exile is like the wandering</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.270" end="00:12:47.830" style="s2">in the desert yeah oh it&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.830" end="00:12:51.850" style="s2">exile is it&#39;s exactly just what we said</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.830" end="00:12:54.490" style="s2">it&#39;s about serving strange things so</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.850" end="00:12:57.100" style="s2">you&#39;re not in charge anymore of relax</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.490" end="00:13:00.640" style="s2">something else is but you&#39;re in you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.100" end="00:13:03.610" style="s2">in that you live in in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.640" end="00:13:06.370" style="s2">you&#39;re not in charge or your identity is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.610" end="00:13:09.940" style="s2">not in charge of the facts and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.370" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">not they don&#39;t fit with reality so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.940" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">means something else is in charge and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:16.420" style="s2">you&#39;re serving that so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:18.590" style="s2">serving strangers in exile</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.420" end="00:13:20.150" style="s2">it simply means</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.590" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">absolutely your identity that match</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.150" end="00:13:24.380" style="s2">reality oh that&#39;s really buddy I never</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:28.490" style="s2">thought about that that idea of serving</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.380" end="00:13:30.200" style="s2">strangers in exile so so okay so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.490" end="00:13:33.280" style="s2">going to branch off that a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.200" end="00:13:36.190" style="s2">different ways so one idea there is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.280" end="00:13:38.450" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea from you which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.190" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">paraphrased something like if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.450" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">if you don&#39;t act out your own myth and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:46.310" style="s2">you serve a bit part in the myths of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:48.260" style="s2">others okay so that will be in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.310" end="00:13:50.530" style="s2">with that idea of serving the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.260" end="00:13:54.290" style="s2">in exile and then the next part would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.530" end="00:13:56.270" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a chaotic state and your</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.290" end="00:13:58.730" style="s2">emotions are dysregulated your</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.270" end="00:14:01.490" style="s2">personality fraction aids and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.730" end="00:14:03.350" style="s2">fractionated personality personality sub</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.490" end="00:14:06.220" style="s2">personalities fight for control over</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.350" end="00:14:08.870" style="s2">over over behavioral output so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.220" end="00:14:11.030" style="s2">dissolve from a unity maite think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.870" end="00:14:14.330" style="s2">it as a pyramid a pyramid with with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.030" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">unifying conception at the top that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.330" end="00:14:17.510" style="s2">disintegrates that would be like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">Tower of Babel to some degree that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.510" end="00:14:23.000" style="s2">disintegrates and then sub entities you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:24.490" style="s2">can think about them as spirits or think</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.000" end="00:14:26.780" style="s2">about them as psychological entities</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.490" end="00:14:28.550" style="s2">regulate your behavior and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.780" end="00:14:31.250" style="s2">equivalent I think to a movement from</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.550" end="00:14:32.950" style="s2">the left hemisphere to the right because</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.250" end="00:14:36.200" style="s2">I think the right is dominated by</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.950" end="00:14:39.110" style="s2">subcortical structures rather I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.200" end="00:14:41.270" style="s2">that&#39;s how the animals exist is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.110" end="00:14:43.180" style="s2">sequential domination by subcortical</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.270" end="00:14:45.340" style="s2">structures rather than some overarching</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.180" end="00:14:48.290" style="s2">conceptualization from the top-down I</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.340" end="00:14:49.970" style="s2">think that what you call the less than</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.290" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">the right is exactly the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.970" end="00:14:53.750" style="s2">traditional left and right I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:56.030" style="s2">sure yet but when you say left</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.750" end="00:14:58.070" style="s2">hemisphere what do you mean well like</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.030" end="00:15:01.280" style="s2">what the left hemisphere governs the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.070" end="00:15:04.130" style="s2">right hand okay so the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.280" end="00:15:07.130" style="s2">is the one that went when it&#39;s in charge</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.130" end="00:15:09.740" style="s2">and when everything works yes okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.130" end="00:15:13.910" style="s2">the right oh it&#39;s exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.740" end="00:15:16.280" style="s2">of the traditional imagery usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.910" end="00:15:17.660" style="s2">the right that&#39;s well yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.280" end="00:15:19.610" style="s2">they&#39;re using the hands and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.660" end="00:15:21.770" style="s2">yeah the brain Rock exactly so the right</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:24.410" style="s2">that it&#39;s the right would be mapped onto</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.770" end="00:15:27.320" style="s2">the left hemisphere okay so that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.410" end="00:15:28.550" style="s2">that&#39;s fine and the traditional imagery</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.320" end="00:15:30.110" style="s2">I think is associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.550" end="00:15:32.180" style="s2">hemispheric specialization as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.110" end="00:15:34.190" style="s2">because the idea of right</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.180" end="00:15:38.200" style="s2">you know well I want to ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.190" end="00:15:43.029" style="s2">question about that you said that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.200" end="00:15:45.250" style="s2">the the living what was it you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.029" end="00:15:48.170" style="s2">contracted exile with what was the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.250" end="00:15:49.970" style="s2">conceptualization and having the homely</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.170" end="00:15:50.630" style="s2">inhabit inhabiting the homeland sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.970" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.630" end="00:15:55.390" style="s2">working on the home working on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">homeland is another way say okay now</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.390" end="00:16:02.960" style="s2">tell me again how you conceptualize the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:08.510" style="s2">relationship between God and and his</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.960" end="00:16:11.029" style="s2">people let&#39;s say in the homeland so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.510" end="00:16:13.700" style="s2">well God like I said at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.029" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">there&#39;s the idea of heaven in earth is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.700" end="00:16:19.100" style="s2">is at the basis of everything in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:24.220" style="s2">Bible so heaven is meaning and earth is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.100" end="00:16:27.050" style="s2">fact so in that relationship there&#39;s God</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.220" end="00:16:29.089" style="s2">it&#39;s always the name of God by the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.050" end="00:16:31.640" style="s2">if you look if you look in the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.089" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">described in the Bible it&#39;s it&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.640" end="00:16:37.370" style="s2">talking about the name of God so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:40.190" style="s2">means the meaning of God so God is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.370" end="00:16:42.140" style="s2">just meaning but when they talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.190" end="00:16:45.370" style="s2">in the Bible it&#39;s always about the name</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.140" end="00:16:47.810" style="s2">of God so the name of God is an identity</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.370" end="00:16:52.490" style="s2">it&#39;s like a principal an axiom or</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.810" end="00:16:57.529" style="s2">something like that and it has to embody</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.490" end="00:17:02.510" style="s2">itself in physical reality flash or in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.529" end="00:17:05.920" style="s2">matter so the the role of the nation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.510" end="00:17:10.309" style="s2">Israel is to embody that identity and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.920" end="00:17:12.410" style="s2">it&#39;s also to embody it in reality not</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.309" end="00:17:15.040" style="s2">just in themselves so basically they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.410" end="00:17:18.260" style="s2">a mediator between heaven and earth</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.040" end="00:17:26.209" style="s2">right they&#39;re trying to make God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.260" end="00:17:28.160" style="s2">identity practical or concrete or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.209" end="00:17:29.809" style="s2">why it&#39;s all about laws because you take</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:32.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s like mathematics you&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.809" end="00:17:36.290" style="s2">at an abstract principle that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.660" end="00:17:38.750" style="s2">extremely simple it doesn&#39;t seem like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.290" end="00:17:40.340" style="s2">it contains much information right if</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.750" end="00:17:42.200" style="s2">you take an axiom in mathematics but</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.340" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">then you have to derive all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.200" end="00:17:45.980" style="s2">implications here so that&#39;s making it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:48.110" style="s2">practical that&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.980" end="00:17:52.010" style="s2">concrete that&#39;s bringing heaven into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.110" end="00:17:56.510" style="s2">earth so that&#39;s their job yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.010" end="00:18:03.140" style="s2">a cosmic mediator okay Dean okay follow</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.510" end="00:18:05.390" style="s2">you so far so all right so the the it</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.140" end="00:18:09.830" style="s2">looks like there&#39;s two ways maybe in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.390" end="00:18:12.470" style="s2">biblical narrative that that will is</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.830" end="00:18:15.770" style="s2">instantiated in in reality and one would</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.470" end="00:18:17.570" style="s2">be as a consequence of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.770" end="00:18:20.630" style="s2">aligning themselves with the Word of God</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.570" end="00:18:23.410" style="s2">and the other is the instantiation of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.630" end="00:18:24.679" style="s2">the Word of God into the State of Israel</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.410" end="00:18:26.630" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.679" end="00:18:29.179" style="s2">seem seem reasonable okay and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.630" end="00:18:31.040" style="s2">to begin that that has its origin in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.179" end="00:18:35.030" style="s2">in the first Abrahamic story</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.040" end="00:18:37.160" style="s2">so Abraham talks to God and or God talks</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.030" end="00:18:39.740" style="s2">to Abraham and tells him that he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.160" end="00:18:43.580" style="s2">to be the father of a nation essentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.740" end="00:18:46.179" style="s2">and then it was to inherit the land to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.580" end="00:18:49.220" style="s2">do that important it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.179" end="00:18:50.780" style="s2">those two things are the same he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.220" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">to inherit the land and he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.780" end="00:18:57.230" style="s2">become the principal of great many</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">people so that&#39;s like he&#39;s fleshing out</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.230" end="00:19:03.890" style="s2">an identity right it gives a nation</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">instead of just an individual right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.890" end="00:19:08.059" style="s2">he&#39;s going to be going to be identity of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">a nation okay and so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.059" end="00:19:14.740" style="s2">understand the description of that in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:17.179" style="s2">the in the biblical narrative because</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.740" end="00:19:19.160" style="s2">one of the very one of the things I find</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.179" end="00:19:21.710" style="s2">very strange about the Abrahamic stories</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.160" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">is that immediate presence of God and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.710" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2">God shows up to Abraham and tells him</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:28.549" style="s2">this and then Abraham makes an altar if</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.450" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">I remember correctly once he gets to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.549" end="00:19:34.360" style="s2">land where he&#39;s supposed to be he makes</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:34.360" style="s2">an altar and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.610" end="00:19:43.150" style="s2">and then God appears to him again yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.940" end="00:19:46.010" style="s2">not again not again</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.150" end="00:19:47.660" style="s2">he appears to him the first time he</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.010" end="00:19:50.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t appear I think I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.660" end="00:19:52.850" style="s2">the first time God speaks to him okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.690" end="00:19:54.670" style="s2">he&#39;s active that&#39;s important okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.850" end="00:19:58.600" style="s2">check inside not distinction important</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.670" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">well because he&#39;s just work he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.600" end="00:20:05.030" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s not physical he&#39;s not a into</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:08.030" style="s2">practical reality yet it&#39;s invisible</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.030" end="00:20:11.450" style="s2">so God speaks he&#39;s not manifest it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.030" end="00:20:13.970" style="s2">just an idea of principle a word okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.450" end="00:20:16.130" style="s2">and unmanifest word or it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.970" end="00:20:19.310" style="s2">minimum of manifestation is like just</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.130" end="00:20:23.330" style="s2">language this word and then so what he</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.310" end="00:20:27.410" style="s2">says is go to this place go to this land</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.330" end="00:20:29.270" style="s2">and you&#39;ll inherit the land and then he</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.410" end="00:20:32.330" style="s2">goes there and then he says God appears</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.270" end="00:20:35.050" style="s2">in our city so okay so there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.330" end="00:20:37.580" style="s2">a progression progressive in there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.050" end="00:20:39.110" style="s2">progressive appearance of God and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.580" end="00:20:43.060" style="s2">partly a consequence of Abraham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.110" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">original obedience to the initial idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.060" end="00:20:50.660" style="s2">yeah which was very abstract means go</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:55.220" style="s2">here you can&#39;t be more simple than that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.660" end="00:20:56.200" style="s2">go there so it&#39;s it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.220" end="00:20:59.630" style="s2">mean anything but it means everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.200" end="00:21:02.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a very everything we do is let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.630" end="00:21:06.710" style="s2">there go there and do something right</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.840" end="00:21:09.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like principle of all things appear</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.710" end="00:21:12.530" style="s2">to Abraham saying just go there and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.820" end="00:21:14.510" style="s2">you&#39;ll inherit that doesn&#39;t really mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.530" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">anything here but it contains everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.510" end="00:21:19.250" style="s2">humans do yeah okay that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">interesting observation because you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.250" end="00:21:23.270" style="s2">I think of human beings as well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">very directional they&#39;re always going</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.270" end="00:21:27.980" style="s2">from point A to point B they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:29.810" style="s2">aiming there like archers right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.980" end="00:21:32.690" style="s2">definitely the case like I had someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.810" end="00:21:34.730" style="s2">write to me know I was doing a patreon</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.690" end="00:21:40.970" style="s2">interview with one of the people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.730" end="00:21:43.210" style="s2">been supporting me a young guy and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.970" end="00:21:48.890" style="s2">were talking about the idea of Christ as</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.210" end="00:21:51.380" style="s2">Redeemer and judge and he was this young</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.890" end="00:21:53.300" style="s2">man was unredeemed let&#39;s say for</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.380" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">period of time because he didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.300" end="00:21:57.770" style="s2">any direction and have direction you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:21:59.660" style="s2">have to know what&#39;s good and what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.770" end="00:22:02.630" style="s2">because to have direction you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.660" end="00:22:04.160" style="s2">to words what&#39;s good and so the judge is</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.630" end="00:22:05.870" style="s2">what helps you figure out what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.160" end="00:22:08.330" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s good then</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.870" end="00:22:10.670" style="s2">you can&#39;t be redeemed because to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.330" end="00:22:12.680" style="s2">redeemed is to be is to be moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.670" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">towards the good and away from let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.680" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">evil so the judge and the Redeemer have</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:18.530" style="s2">to be the same thing and that fits in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:20.330" style="s2">with what you&#39;re saying because the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.530" end="00:22:22.310" style="s2">judge is the thing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.330" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">qualitative distinctions let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.310" end="00:22:25.700" style="s2">you need to make a qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:29.750" style="s2">distinction before you can move ahead</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.700" end="00:22:32.510" style="s2">okay and so your point is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.750" end="00:22:34.580" style="s2">principle that Abraham encounters to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.510" end="00:22:36.350" style="s2">begin with is the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.580" end="00:22:37.850" style="s2">directionality itself qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.350" end="00:22:40.760" style="s2">directionality it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.850" end="00:22:44.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s right yeah it&#39;s well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.760" end="00:22:47.480" style="s2">the positive identity of anything like</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.600" end="00:22:49.340" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like a seed it&#39;s like the seed</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.480" end="00:22:51.020" style="s2">of a tree that&#39;s that&#39;s the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.340" end="00:22:53.900" style="s2">way to understand it it&#39;s just a seed</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.020" end="00:22:56.930" style="s2">yeah it contains everything in it but in</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.900" end="00:22:58.490" style="s2">itself it&#39;s just something like go there</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.930" end="00:22:59.930" style="s2">something go there okay so that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.490" end="00:23:02.270" style="s2">okay so one of the things that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.930" end="00:23:03.950" style="s2">interesting I think for me to learn</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.270" end="00:23:06.950" style="s2">personally as I moved through my life</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.950" end="00:23:10.610" style="s2">was that if I ever actually did anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.950" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">it was worthwhile yes you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.610" end="00:23:13.720" style="s2">mean is that something would come of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:16.550" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.720" end="00:23:21.110" style="s2">expected to come of it but yet act of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.550" end="00:23:23.960" style="s2">going and doing did bear fruit yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.110" end="00:23:24.650" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much the story of Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.960" end="00:23:28.160" style="s2">in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.650" end="00:23:30.350" style="s2">actually what he just said because God</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.160" end="00:23:33.500" style="s2">says go here the only hair is the land</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.350" end="00:23:34.790" style="s2">Abraham doesn&#39;t inherit the land I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.500" end="00:23:37.460" style="s2">he could have been right away you could</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.790" end="00:23:39.410" style="s2">have gone there and it&#39;s yours right no</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.460" end="00:23:40.970" style="s2">sir that&#39;s what it says as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.410" end="00:23:43.310" style="s2">gets there it says there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.970" end="00:23:45.380" style="s2">people there that the land is already</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.310" end="00:23:48.650" style="s2">owned by other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.380" end="00:23:51.710" style="s2">Grady&#39;s always a famine yeah exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.650" end="00:23:54.830" style="s2">that means it means like what I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.710" end="00:23:55.310" style="s2">saying before the facts supports the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.830" end="00:23:57.380" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.310" end="00:23:59.540" style="s2">okay and here is going to the land</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.380" end="00:24:01.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the theory you&#39;ll inherit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.540" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">the theory and the facts don&#39;t support</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.160" end="00:24:05.300" style="s2">it that&#39;s a--fun okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:08.270" style="s2">the earth doesn&#39;t supply</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.300" end="00:24:10.160" style="s2">the earth doesn&#39;t give you sustenance to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.270" end="00:24:13.310" style="s2">make it reality it doesn&#39;t give you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.160" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">matter yeah give him a disease of in</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.310" end="00:24:18.530" style="s2">Egypt and I mean his wife is separated</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:20.780" style="s2">on a limb essentially a because he lies</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.530" end="00:24:23.480" style="s2">about her but then it&#39;s so strange</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.780" end="00:24:25.640" style="s2">because so he tells the Pharaoh and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.480" end="00:24:27.680" style="s2">Pharaohs men that his wife is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.640" end="00:24:30.110" style="s2">sister that&#39;s Soraya&#39;s Sarai</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.680" end="00:24:32.210" style="s2">that how you say that yeah sir or she</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.110" end="00:24:35.960" style="s2">changes the name yet yes it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.210" end="00:24:39.620" style="s2">his sister and that&#39;s to protect them</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.960" end="00:24:41.870" style="s2">and so the Pharaoh takes Sarai and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.620" end="00:24:44.330" style="s2">okay going up they can I say something</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.870" end="00:24:46.700" style="s2">you bet there&#39;s a meaning to all those</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.330" end="00:24:50.570" style="s2">things as a meaning to it okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.700" end="00:24:52.430" style="s2">idea is that when fact that fact support</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.570" end="00:24:54.290" style="s2">the theory okay when when the flesh</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.430" end="00:24:57.380" style="s2">supports the identity or the matters</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.290" end="00:25:00.350" style="s2">haven&#39;t earth support seven things are</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.380" end="00:25:01.880" style="s2">square okay that&#39;s just a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.350" end="00:25:05.660" style="s2">way of understanding it that basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.880" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">means that what you see is what you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.660" end="00:25:12.170" style="s2">okay it&#39;s it&#39;s true things are true</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:15.590" style="s2">that&#39;s the definition of meaning matches</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.170" end="00:25:18.980" style="s2">fact yes true okay fine when pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.590" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">definition yeah when when the other side</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.980" end="00:25:25.850" style="s2">happens then things are round there</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:28.730" style="s2">they&#39;re cyclical okay and it essentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.850" end="00:25:29.030" style="s2">it&#39;s time its space in time that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.730" end="00:25:31.490" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.030" end="00:25:34.790" style="s2">okay one of them you&#39;re falling into</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.490" end="00:25:38.180" style="s2">time things are not square that means</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.790" end="00:25:39.770" style="s2">things do not the meaning doesn&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.180" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">the facts that&#39;s why it&#39;s all out lives</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.770" end="00:25:44.930" style="s2">okay when they go into exile it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:49.460" style="s2">about lives it&#39;s all about screaming</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.930" end="00:25:51.650" style="s2">okay because they&#39;re in that domain</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.460" end="00:25:54.710" style="s2">they&#39;re in a domain where meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.650" end="00:25:57.950" style="s2">fact doesn&#39;t match so everything happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.710" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">through lies interception and even the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.950" end="00:26:05.920" style="s2">whole idea of saying my wife is my</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:07.160" style="s2">sister less that represents a cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.920" end="00:26:10.580" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.160" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">okay it was supposed to happen well why</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.580" end="00:26:16.999" style="s2">cyclical your parent has a son and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:22.339" style="s2">daughter</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.999" end="00:26:24.589" style="s2">and they get married it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.339" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">regression okay it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.589" end="00:26:29.869" style="s2">producing different things and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:31.849" style="s2">you&#39;re joining them back together and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.869" end="00:26:33.949" style="s2">I&#39;m supposed to join them back together</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.849" end="00:26:35.979" style="s2">because when you join them back together</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.949" end="00:26:39.049" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re going you&#39;re regressing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.979" end="00:26:41.959" style="s2">when you rebuild something you start on</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.049" end="00:26:44.329" style="s2">principle and you develop it take you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.959" end="00:26:48.979" style="s2">make specializations of that principle</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.329" end="00:26:51.589" style="s2">when you start to mix them up again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.979" end="00:26:53.859" style="s2">like a regression you&#39;re going back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.589" end="00:26:56.329" style="s2">something more primitive than before</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.859" end="00:26:58.039" style="s2">okay now essentially that how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.329" end="00:27:02.109" style="s2">that in relationship to Abraham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.039" end="00:27:05.719" style="s2">insistence that Sarai is his is his</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.109" end="00:27:08.479" style="s2">distant sister yeah because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.719" end="00:27:10.369" style="s2">supposed to marry your sister and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.479" end="00:27:12.919" style="s2">not saying that as a moralistic thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.369" end="00:27:14.899" style="s2">even though it becomes one but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.919" end="00:27:18.789" style="s2">reason you shouldn&#39;t marry your sister</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.899" end="00:27:21.979" style="s2">is because you&#39;re undoing the work the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.789" end="00:27:25.189" style="s2">specializations that your your your</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.979" end="00:27:26.179" style="s2">father or your mother have created it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.189" end="00:27:28.849" style="s2">like going back</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.179" end="00:27:32.259" style="s2">it&#39;s like regressing so like if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.849" end="00:27:35.479" style="s2">marry your your father or your mother or</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.259" end="00:27:37.219" style="s2">depending at your going back it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.479" end="00:27:40.189" style="s2">cycle you&#39;re not smoking that because</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.219" end="00:27:44.239" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re annihilating something</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.189" end="00:27:46.009" style="s2">that was specified okay look I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.239" end="00:27:48.769" style="s2">you an example like it&#39;s imagery of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.009" end="00:27:51.049" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty important in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.769" end="00:27:55.609" style="s2">the flood there are traditions that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.049" end="00:27:57.379" style="s2">Giants created hybrids okay yeah one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.609" end="00:27:58.969" style="s2">the things that Giants like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.379" end="00:28:01.879" style="s2">create hybrids that they are either</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.969" end="00:28:04.879" style="s2">themselves but they created hybrids they</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.879" end="00:28:09.499" style="s2">took the species and they confuse them</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.879" end="00:28:11.119" style="s2">back into who knows what okay and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.499" end="00:28:15.499" style="s2">very significant because it actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.119" end="00:28:19.339" style="s2">means that you are regressing in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.499" end="00:28:21.439" style="s2">confused manner okay that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.339" end="00:28:24.109" style="s2">connection between the flood and what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.439" end="00:28:26.690" style="s2">just said making hybrids and causing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.109" end="00:28:28.850" style="s2">flood it&#39;s actually considered one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.690" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.850" end="00:28:34.070" style="s2">because I mean that makes some sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:36.710" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s about returning to confusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.070" end="00:28:39.889" style="s2">yep look look I&#39;ll say it this way</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.710" end="00:28:42.440" style="s2">either names the animals Adam Adam name</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.889" end="00:28:44.630" style="s2">gentleman&#39;s gating forgot asked Adams</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.440" end="00:28:48.309" style="s2">and in Genesis first job in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.630" end="00:28:52.009" style="s2">so he&#39;s asking is just specify different</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.309" end="00:28:54.889" style="s2">things okay that are all I&#39;ll have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.009" end="00:28:57.139" style="s2">same source right the same attitude yep</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.889" end="00:28:59.750" style="s2">differentiate that the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.139" end="00:29:03.169" style="s2">incarnated a principle into practice</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.750" end="00:29:06.620" style="s2">damn please get differentiated okay now</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.169" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">if you reverse that process you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.620" end="00:29:11.090" style="s2">back to a more primitive level you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:13.250" style="s2">going back to the flood because the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.090" end="00:29:15.950" style="s2">flood is the most primitive thing in in</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.250" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">that cosmology right it starts with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.950" end="00:29:21.139" style="s2">flooded world that means everything&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:23.799" style="s2">confusion so what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.139" end="00:29:27.789" style="s2">specify things out but if you go back</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.799" end="00:29:30.139" style="s2">there says okay so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.789" end="00:29:30.950" style="s2">reformulate that and tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.139" end="00:29:34.879" style="s2">popped into mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.950" end="00:29:37.370" style="s2">alright so God gives Abraham the word</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.879" end="00:29:39.049" style="s2">and then Abraham follows it and God</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.370" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">manifests himself more completely to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.049" end="00:29:44.149" style="s2">Abraham and then what happens to Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:47.029" style="s2">is twofold he ends up in a barren land</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.149" end="00:29:50.600" style="s2">so nature rebels and he also ends up in</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.029" end="00:29:53.000" style="s2">a tyranny right because he it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.600" end="00:29:55.429" style="s2">not only does the land not produce so</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.000" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">it&#39;s in a famine but Egypt eventually</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.429" end="00:30:01.669" style="s2">Egypt is generally speaking a symbol for</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:03.230" style="s2">for tyranny throughout the initial parts</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.669" end="00:30:05.600" style="s2">of the Old Testament I mean you see that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.230" end="00:30:08.870" style="s2">with the Pharaoh for example and and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.600" end="00:30:10.519" style="s2">symbolism in in the mosaic story of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.870" end="00:30:12.950" style="s2">of Egypt always being associated with</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.519" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">stone instead of water and so you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.950" end="00:30:19.549" style="s2">say that God gives Abraham the command</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:21.440" style="s2">to move forward but he has to contend</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.549" end="00:30:24.139" style="s2">with the intransigence II of nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.440" end="00:30:26.269" style="s2">which rejects him because there was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.139" end="00:30:29.059" style="s2">famine and then he becomes subjugate</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.269" end="00:30:32.899" style="s2">some become subject to both tyranny and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.059" end="00:30:37.129" style="s2">to deceit and so okay they see him oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.899" end="00:30:39.049" style="s2">well this is there any are look okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.129" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">I&#39;ll say it this way it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.049" end="00:30:43.910" style="s2">about deceits and tearing okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:44.600" style="s2">but the thing is when you&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.910" end="00:30:47.810" style="s2">charge</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.600" end="00:30:50.600" style="s2">I mean desert here nice that&#39;s it when</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.810" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">you&#39;re you or whoever you identify with</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.600" end="00:30:55.220" style="s2">is not in charge you&#39;re a slave to some</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:58.100" style="s2">other principle right</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.220" end="00:31:00.980" style="s2">you&#39;re embodying some other will that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.100" end="00:31:03.980" style="s2">not you I mean that&#39;s theorem you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.980" end="00:31:05.480" style="s2">right I mean so right and that said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.980" end="00:31:08.450" style="s2">really directly related to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.480" end="00:31:11.150" style="s2">hearing you&#39;re serving strangers break</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.450" end="00:31:13.910" style="s2">it says it all well that also motivates</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.150" end="00:31:15.950" style="s2">that also motivates Abraham&#39;s deception</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.910" end="00:31:17.690" style="s2">right because he&#39;s terrified that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.950" end="00:31:20.660" style="s2">strangers that he&#39;s serving will kill</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.690" end="00:31:22.550" style="s2">him yet for his wife for his wife and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.660" end="00:31:25.670" style="s2">that&#39;s why he lied and he&#39;s afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.550" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">he&#39;s going to be treated very badly yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.670" end="00:31:32.060" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t want strangers to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:36.170" style="s2">have his wife okay his wife is like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.060" end="00:31:39.890" style="s2">earth his wife is how he will incarnate</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.170" end="00:31:40.340" style="s2">himself or express himself yeah in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.890" end="00:31:42.350" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.340" end="00:31:45.560" style="s2">he&#39;s like the seed and the wife is like</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.350" end="00:31:50.120" style="s2">feet above the earth something like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.560" end="00:31:51.620" style="s2">so she some she is like his earth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.120" end="00:31:54.530" style="s2">like a miniature version of hadn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.620" end="00:31:57.410" style="s2">earth the male is heaven and the female</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.530" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">is the earth in that case that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.410" end="00:32:02.540" style="s2">whole idea he&#39;s not in charge of fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:05.630" style="s2">anymore that includes his wife batting</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.540" end="00:32:10.090" style="s2">dreams so he doesn&#39;t want other men</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.630" end="00:32:12.050" style="s2">other principles to control his wife</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.090" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">right does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.050" end="00:32:18.070" style="s2">yes well it also it also seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">that because he&#39;s the land isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.070" end="00:32:22.760" style="s2">fruitful for him and because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:26.450" style="s2">serving strangers in a strange land</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.760" end="00:32:27.610" style="s2">he&#39;s also correct to be afraid for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.450" end="00:32:31.160" style="s2">loss of his wife</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.610" end="00:32:34.040" style="s2">yes and how does he get out of it by</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.160" end="00:32:38.030" style="s2">being deceitful because yes he&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.040" end="00:32:39.560" style="s2">cycle he&#39;s in that I mean are you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.030" end="00:32:43.940" style="s2">supposed to be truthful with your</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.560" end="00:32:46.070" style="s2">adversary usually no especially when</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.940" end="00:32:49.940" style="s2">you&#39;re adversaries hostile and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.070" end="00:32:51.620" style="s2">an enemy territory your morality changes</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.940" end="00:32:53.809" style="s2">because all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.620" end="00:32:56.419" style="s2">it&#39;s not about being truthful it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.809" end="00:33:00.380" style="s2">surviving it&#39;s about it&#39;s like the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.419" end="00:33:03.289" style="s2">primitive existence there is right the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.380" end="00:33:05.450" style="s2">more primitive state of existence are</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.289" end="00:33:08.510" style="s2">more about species than about truth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.450" end="00:33:10.309" style="s2">it&#39;s an advance it&#39;s an advanced state</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.510" end="00:33:12.169" style="s2">to talk about truth it&#39;s when we all</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.309" end="00:33:14.690" style="s2">agree you know we all agree on at least</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.169" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">something but before that is every man</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.690" end="00:33:18.470" style="s2">or woman for him or herself it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:21.350" style="s2">about the seat</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.470" end="00:33:22.929" style="s2">it&#39;s almost survival okay okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.350" end="00:33:26.149" style="s2">now the next thing that happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.929" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">essentially is that the Pharaoh gets</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.149" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">plagued and he&#39;s wondering why so</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:36.140" style="s2">because so the story indicates that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:39.110" style="s2">Pharaoh has broken some natural law</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.140" end="00:33:40.760" style="s2">let&#39;s say or some divine law and things</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.110" end="00:33:43.520" style="s2">go very badly for him and then he</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.760" end="00:33:46.760" style="s2">discovers I don&#39;t remember how he</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.520" end="00:33:49.520" style="s2">discovers that he&#39;s taken suraíh sir I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.760" end="00:33:51.890" style="s2">think it doesn&#39;t say how yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.520" end="00:33:53.659" style="s2">that&#39;s right and and he discovers that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.890" end="00:33:56.450" style="s2">he&#39;s taken Sarah but that Sarah is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.659" end="00:33:59.950" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s wife and so then the Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:02.630" style="s2">gives Abraham all sorts of goods and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.950" end="00:34:04.970" style="s2">yeah enzym on his way okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.630" end="00:34:07.789" style="s2">also quite confusing so abraham is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.970" end="00:34:10.580" style="s2">rewarded for is to see a sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.789" end="00:34:16.460" style="s2">ill-gotten good yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.580" end="00:34:18.409" style="s2">ile des good yeah Barto story sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.460" end="00:34:20.599" style="s2">it&#39;s raining because you also see I</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.409" end="00:34:23.089" style="s2">think did not account some of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.599" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">complexity that&#39;s embedded in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.089" end="00:34:27.320" style="s2">Old Testament accounts is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:29.750" style="s2">a simple morality tale it - stretch of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.320" end="00:34:33.169" style="s2">the imagination especially see that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.750" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">the Abrahamic accounts because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.169" end="00:34:38.540" style="s2">Jacob who who&#39;s so deceitful with Esau I</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:40.849" style="s2">mean he thought comes off I mean he has</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.540" end="00:34:44.690" style="s2">kind of he&#39;s kind of unconscious he saw</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.849" end="00:34:46.429" style="s2">yeah he gives things up too easily he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.690" end="00:34:48.679" style="s2">too easily deceived and he&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.429" end="00:34:50.690" style="s2">primitive it too primitive in a bit too</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.679" end="00:34:53.869" style="s2">naive something like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.690" end="00:34:55.609" style="s2">but Jacob places and Rachel plays some</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.869" end="00:34:57.339" style="s2">really nasty tricks on him and yet they</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.609" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">come out ahead</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.339" end="00:35:03.109" style="s2">yeah and so that&#39;s also a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:05.150" style="s2">thing to contend with well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.109" end="00:35:07.220" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea at least</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.150" end="00:35:11.180" style="s2">in traditional interpretation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.220" end="00:35:15.259" style="s2">this idea that in Esau is actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.180" end="00:35:17.690" style="s2">supposed to be that the king he should</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.259" end="00:35:19.880" style="s2">be the only reason he isn&#39;t is because</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.690" end="00:35:22.430" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong that pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.880" end="00:35:25.400" style="s2">described the whole Bible in its</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.430" end="00:35:27.589" style="s2">entirety that there&#39;s there&#39;s the theory</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.400" end="00:35:29.690" style="s2">in the fact the fact is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.589" end="00:35:33.529" style="s2">king okay do you know what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.690" end="00:35:36.230" style="s2">that like I matter is king that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.529" end="00:35:37.910" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to be but it&#39;s not and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.230" end="00:35:43.730" style="s2">whole all the stories are about</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.910" end="00:35:46.190" style="s2">redeeming redeeming that problem taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.730" end="00:35:49.249" style="s2">care of that problem like the fact don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.190" end="00:35:53.990" style="s2">match the theory we have to redeem the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.249" end="00:35:56.799" style="s2">facts that&#39;s that pretty much all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.990" end="00:36:00.140" style="s2">stories in the Bible are about that and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.799" end="00:36:02.569" style="s2">that pretty much what&#39;s lost represents</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.140" end="00:36:05.509" style="s2">in the story of Abraham as well okay he</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.569" end="00:36:08.329" style="s2">represents the material reality he</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.509" end="00:36:10.339" style="s2">represents facts but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.329" end="00:36:12.789" style="s2">wrong with it let&#39;s go into the large</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.339" end="00:36:17.539" style="s2">story now so okay so Abraham leaves and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.789" end="00:36:20.779" style="s2">I believe he leaves with lot and and law</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.539" end="00:36:23.420" style="s2">it also becomes quite wealthy and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.779" end="00:36:28.759" style="s2">go back to where Abraham had built the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.420" end="00:36:31.430" style="s2">altar initially but lot Lots men and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.759" end="00:36:32.839" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s men started to fight yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.430" end="00:36:35.809" style="s2">they decide they&#39;re going to separate</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.839" end="00:36:37.249" style="s2">and they basically do that somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.809" end="00:36:41.589" style="s2">arbitrarily it could have gone either</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.249" end="00:36:44.809" style="s2">way but lot ends up going to sort them</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.589" end="00:36:47.180" style="s2">well actually there&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.809" end="00:36:49.339" style="s2">should be aware of well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.180" end="00:36:53.210" style="s2">the thing a lot of the stories in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.339" end="00:36:55.579" style="s2">Bible are based on a really ancient way</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.210" end="00:36:58.130" style="s2">of thinking that we don&#39;t really follow</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.579" end="00:37:02.059" style="s2">anymore but I mean in the Bible there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.130" end="00:37:04.430" style="s2">a reason why the directions of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.059" end="00:37:09.099" style="s2">travels that they&#39;re not just random</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.430" end="00:37:12.049" style="s2">like Egypt represents the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.099" end="00:37:15.140" style="s2">what&#39;s the name of the city what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.049" end="00:37:17.880" style="s2">name of the place above her amethy the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.140" end="00:37:21.540" style="s2">place where he goes to meet</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.880" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">Laban eyes in the north okay I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.540" end="00:37:24.690" style="s2">sure I remember the name of this see I</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:27.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s Iran that represents heaven</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.690" end="00:37:30.300" style="s2">okay and there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.030" end="00:37:34.080" style="s2">arbitrary it&#39;s because Egypt is south</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.300" end="00:37:36.180" style="s2">and South is going down right we still</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.080" end="00:37:37.830" style="s2">say that when you say that someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.180" end="00:37:39.410" style="s2">gone south we say that means that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.830" end="00:37:43.860" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone to cedar they&#39;ve gone down</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.410" end="00:37:46.740" style="s2">yes so so in the Bible and especially in</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.860" end="00:37:48.600" style="s2">Genesis especially in Genesis the South</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.740" end="00:37:50.940" style="s2">represents the earth and the North</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.600" end="00:37:52.890" style="s2">represents the heavens okay and like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.940" end="00:37:55.890" style="s2">said it&#39;s not arbitrary it corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.890" end="00:37:57.360" style="s2">to the geography of the region one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.890" end="00:38:00.300" style="s2">them goes up hills the other one goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.360" end="00:38:02.220" style="s2">downhill and the north is mountains like</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.300" end="00:38:04.800" style="s2">snowy mountains and in the south there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.220" end="00:38:06.690" style="s2">a Egypt which is like the low a low</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.800" end="00:38:09.330" style="s2">place and summary to North literally is</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.690" end="00:38:11.610" style="s2">up yeah it&#39;s not a metaphor yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.330" end="00:38:13.020" style="s2">it literally is close going getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.610" end="00:38:15.270" style="s2">closer to heaven and the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.020" end="00:38:17.640" style="s2">going into the earth so when they go in</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.270" end="00:38:20.820" style="s2">exile into Egypt there it&#39;s actually me</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.640" end="00:38:24.090" style="s2">they&#39;re going into the earth it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.820" end="00:38:26.940" style="s2">defense in two years so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.090" end="00:38:28.260" style="s2">death its death right and they say it a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.940" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">few times in the book of Genesis they</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.260" end="00:38:36.390" style="s2">talk about your it&#39;s like dying going it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:39.240" style="s2">going to Egypt is like a death okay so</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.390" end="00:38:47.340" style="s2">then now so then we moved to the story</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.240" end="00:38:50.010" style="s2">of the strangers right wait nothing</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.340" end="00:38:52.800" style="s2">you&#39;re going to say why the separation</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.010" end="00:38:56.010" style="s2">of the land with lot and an Abraham oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">yes right the idea is that lot takes the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.010" end="00:39:01.320" style="s2">the south right and then a ramp oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.570" style="s2">that was the whole point of that yes a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.320" end="00:39:06.260" style="s2">lot there&#39;s a reason why he takes the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.570" end="00:39:09.750" style="s2">south it&#39;s the lowest place on earth</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.260" end="00:39:14.460" style="s2">Sodom and Gomorrah that that place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.750" end="00:39:15.390" style="s2">the lowest place okay so literally the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.460" end="00:39:17.340" style="s2">lowest place on earth</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.390" end="00:39:20.580" style="s2">right I&#39;m not sure I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.340" end="00:39:22.410" style="s2">know I think that region actually is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.580" end="00:39:24.540" style="s2">lowest place on earth but in the story</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.410" end="00:39:26.670" style="s2">that that&#39;s how that&#39;s what it means it</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.540" end="00:39:28.080" style="s2">means it&#39;s the lowest place you can go</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.670" end="00:39:30.900" style="s2">so it&#39;s a place that&#39;s farthest away</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.080" end="00:39:31.500" style="s2">from heaven yeah it&#39;s all in order</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.900" end="00:39:33.300" style="s2">you&#39;re like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.500" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">idea that milton develops with regards</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.300" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">to satan when he&#39;s thrown from heaven</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:40.200" style="s2">because the hell that satan inhabits is</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:43.460" style="s2">the furthest possible away from heaven</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.200" end="00:39:48.360" style="s2">that&#39;s got to find essentially okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.460" end="00:39:51.510" style="s2">that&#39;s like a journey into fear yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.360" end="00:39:54.180" style="s2">the same as it means the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.510" end="00:39:57.330" style="s2">falling asleep exile and sleep are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.180" end="00:40:00.420" style="s2">same in the Bible sleep it&#39;ll kick this</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.330" end="00:40:03.570" style="s2">form of Exile okay so it is so so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.420" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">next thing that happens is that we get</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.570" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">the first warning about Sodom and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:14.030" style="s2">Gomorrah yes that&#39;s just a very brief</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:16.800" style="s2">sentence it&#39;s like a foreshadowing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.030" end="00:40:19.050" style="s2">then the next thing that happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.800" end="00:40:23.910" style="s2">there&#39;s an episode where there is a war</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.050" end="00:40:26.490" style="s2">among kings and the kings if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.910" end="00:40:31.410" style="s2">correctly it&#39;s the king of Sodom takes</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.490" end="00:40:34.770" style="s2">lot and Abraham has to go rescue him and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.410" end="00:40:35.490" style="s2">he&#39;d actually actually I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.770" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">other way around</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.490" end="00:40:41.880" style="s2">I think it&#39;s Kings from the north that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:45.390" style="s2">come down and take Sodom and Gomorrah</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.880" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">and a lot as part of that and so is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.390" end="00:40:51.600" style="s2">king the king of Sodom and Gomorrah they</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:53.970" style="s2">have to flee that&#39;s what I remember okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.600" end="00:40:58.200" style="s2">do they flee with do they flee with what</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.970" end="00:41:02.430" style="s2">no law is taken by these chains from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.200" end="00:41:04.110" style="s2">north and the king of Sodom yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.430" end="00:41:06.690" style="s2">hives or something like that please</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.110" end="00:41:09.060" style="s2">and then Abraham the King the king of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.690" end="00:41:11.370" style="s2">Sodom at the end give gifts to Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.060" end="00:41:13.380" style="s2">to thank him that he today rescued him</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.370" end="00:41:16.020" style="s2">yes that&#39;s right so what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.380" end="00:41:18.750" style="s2">yeah it says it came to pass in the days</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.020" end="00:41:21.420" style="s2">of amraphel king of shinar etc that</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.750" end="00:41:24.140" style="s2">these made war with bera king of sodom</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.420" end="00:41:26.370" style="s2">and with persia king of gomorrah etc and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.140" end="00:41:28.410" style="s2">these were all joined together in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.370" end="00:41:31.830" style="s2">Vale of Siddim which is in the Salton</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.410" end="00:41:33.120" style="s2">Sea which is the salt sea so I presume</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.830" end="00:41:34.890" style="s2">that would be the Dead Sea and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.120" end="00:41:36.300" style="s2">would be that identity the low point</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.890" end="00:41:38.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re describing those actual</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.300" end="00:41:42.300" style="s2">earth is the Dead Sea yes pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.280" end="00:41:44.250" style="s2">interesting yeah and the Vale of Siddim</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.300" end="00:41:45.329" style="s2">was full of slime pits and the kings of</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.250" end="00:41:47.489" style="s2">Sodom and Gomorrah</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.329" end="00:41:49.380" style="s2">and fell there and they took away all</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.489" end="00:41:51.019" style="s2">the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.380" end="00:41:53.910" style="s2">their victuals and they took lot Abrams</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.019" end="00:41:58.440" style="s2">brothers son who deltas who dwelt in</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.910" end="00:42:00.329" style="s2">Sodom and his Goods and departed so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.440" end="00:42:02.279" style="s2">can really see this whole geography did</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.329" end="00:42:04.109" style="s2">Matthew talking about when they say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.279" end="00:42:05.940" style="s2">Sodom and Gomorrah they had to flee and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.109" end="00:42:07.589" style="s2">fall into slime pits it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.940" end="00:42:09.420" style="s2">they&#39;re laying it out for us that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.589" end="00:42:11.369" style="s2">had to almost kind of go even further</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.420" end="00:42:14.009" style="s2">down into the earth to hide from these</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.369" end="00:42:17.190" style="s2">these these invaders of the north that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.009" end="00:42:21.299" style="s2">are coming to take their their land so</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.190" end="00:42:26.069" style="s2">ok so Abram goes in rescues lot and he</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.299" end="00:42:30.539" style="s2">does that successfully and the and also</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.069" end="00:42:33.839" style="s2">there&#39;s Kings that he that he frees as</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.539" end="00:42:37.829" style="s2">far as I can tell yeah and probably then</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.839" end="00:42:40.200" style="s2">the Kings want to reward him and Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.829" end="00:42:42.630" style="s2">says to the king of Sodom that he</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.200" end="00:42:44.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want any reward and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.630" end="00:42:46.559" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t want any reward except for</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.279" end="00:42:49.799" style="s2">what his men have eaten he doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.559" end="00:42:51.989" style="s2">any reward because I will not take</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.799" end="00:42:54.989" style="s2">anything that is thine lest thou should</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.989" end="00:42:56.430" style="s2">say I have made abram rich save only</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.989" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">that which the young men have eaten and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.430" end="00:43:04.949" style="s2">the portion of the men which went with</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:07.170" style="s2">me and it looks see God has already</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.949" end="00:43:09.420" style="s2">promised Abraham everything in some</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.170" end="00:43:10.890" style="s2">sense and it looks like he doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.420" end="00:43:12.829" style="s2">to take anything and Abraham doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.890" end="00:43:16.529" style="s2">want to take anything from anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.829" end="00:43:18.209" style="s2">because what would it want to do would</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.529" end="00:43:20.819" style="s2">it interfere with the purity of his</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.209" end="00:43:23.509" style="s2">accomplishments something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.819" end="00:43:26.910" style="s2">well III don&#39;t know for certain because</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.509" end="00:43:28.920" style="s2">that&#39;s just a line I guess but in the in</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.910" end="00:43:31.259" style="s2">the story in it it&#39;s not that much of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.920" end="00:43:34.499" style="s2">big part of the story but the way I see</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.259" end="00:43:37.799" style="s2">it is I think he says I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.499" end="00:43:39.869" style="s2">take even a shoe lash if you latch from</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.799" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">you ok so the reason why he said that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.869" end="00:43:47.369" style="s2">because the shoe is the lowest part is</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:50.009" style="s2">the lowest clothing right it is not on</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.369" end="00:43:53.339" style="s2">the feet so it&#39;s all related to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.009" end="00:43:56.099" style="s2">that the earth needs to be redeemed</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.339" end="00:43:58.740" style="s2">needs needs to be rectified and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.099" end="00:44:01.140" style="s2">that situation it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.740" end="00:44:02.370" style="s2">like he&#39;s not allowed to accept a</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.140" end="00:44:04.410" style="s2">certain thing is not eating the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.370" end="00:44:07.170" style="s2">forbidden fruit there are things in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.410" end="00:44:09.270" style="s2">world that are poisonous to humans we</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.170" end="00:44:15.150" style="s2">can&#39;t eat them because they don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.270" end="00:44:20.490" style="s2">with our our patterns our mind so if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.150" end="00:44:22.290" style="s2">eat poison you go into that place where</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.490" end="00:44:24.690" style="s2">things don&#39;t agree your mind and your</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.290" end="00:44:29.970" style="s2">body don&#39;t agree and if you if you if</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.690" end="00:44:32.730" style="s2">you take if you drink alcohol that takes</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.970" end="00:44:35.790" style="s2">you into the realm where your mind and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.730" end="00:44:38.760" style="s2">your body don&#39;t agree the theory doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.790" end="00:44:42.570" style="s2">match the fact and then you go into that</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.760" end="00:44:45.540" style="s2">whole confusion and so it could it be</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.570" end="00:44:47.760" style="s2">that when when you don&#39;t have he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.540" end="00:44:49.860" style="s2">want to take from Sodom because Sodom is</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.760" end="00:44:52.710" style="s2">already what we know Sodom to be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.860" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">it already represents kind of the land</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.710" end="00:44:56.700" style="s2">it can&#39;t hold and will be burned off yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.620" style="s2">it&#39;s something he can&#39;t he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.700" end="00:45:00.150" style="s2">integrate right something it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.620" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">leather I said the forbidden fruit it</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.150" end="00:45:05.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to eat you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:07.530" style="s2">accept matter that you can&#39;t handle that</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.400" end="00:45:12.030" style="s2">you can&#39;t integrate so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.530" end="00:45:14.550" style="s2">in that place that he doesn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.030" end="00:45:16.470" style="s2">to deal with what to do with it and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.550" end="00:45:18.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want his riches to come from</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.470" end="00:45:19.320" style="s2">that place you didn&#39;t write these</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.180" end="00:45:21.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want his riches to come from</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.320" end="00:45:24.150" style="s2">that place yeah that would compromise</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.720" end="00:45:25.970" style="s2">him because he doesn&#39;t know how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.150" end="00:45:29.190" style="s2">with it yeah maybe someday you will</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.970" end="00:45:31.940" style="s2">that&#39;s correct that&#39;s the whole idea and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.190" end="00:45:36.360" style="s2">actually here&#39;s an interpretation lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.940" end="00:45:40.500" style="s2">represents that place that will one day</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.360" end="00:45:42.300" style="s2">be redeemed okay the reason why they</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.500" end="00:45:46.320" style="s2">talk about lot so much in the story of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.300" end="00:45:49.310" style="s2">Abraham is because he represents King</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.320" end="00:45:52.350" style="s2">David but he is the ancestor of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.310" end="00:45:54.330" style="s2">nation that will give rise to King David</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.350" end="00:45:57.600" style="s2">okay it&#39;s like a secondary story within</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.330" end="00:46:00.710" style="s2">the story but it&#39;s like a it&#39;s meant to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.600" end="00:46:04.590" style="s2">be interpreted in terms of a future</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.710" end="00:46:06.570" style="s2">redemption of that place that he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.590" end="00:46:09.570" style="s2">handle that Abraham could not handle at</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.570" end="00:46:11.670" style="s2">that time and that place will be</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.570" end="00:46:12.420" style="s2">redeemed I&#39;m giving you a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.670" end="00:46:14.730" style="s2">tradition here</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.420" end="00:46:18.120" style="s2">I happen this is what I quit I what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.730" end="00:46:22.020" style="s2">learned it&#39;s King David okay it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.120" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">future King okay so the whole one area</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.020" end="00:46:26.580" style="s2">vlog is about King David one and of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:28.970" style="s2">course Lauda is Abraham&#39;s descendants as</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.580" end="00:46:31.260" style="s2">well because he&#39;s his nephew yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.970" end="00:46:35.010" style="s2">Ibrahim is nephew descends into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.260" end="00:46:37.260" style="s2">lowest place essentially yeah well look</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.010" end="00:46:39.600" style="s2">it the story just starts out pretty</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.260" end="00:46:45.390" style="s2">clear it starts out there&#39;s three sons</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.600" end="00:46:47.130" style="s2">to Tara one of them is her on the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.390" end="00:46:51.030" style="s2">ones Nahor and the other ones Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.130" end="00:46:54.270" style="s2">okay Aaron dies that&#39;s how the story</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.030" end="00:46:57.780" style="s2">starts okay that&#39;s like the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.270" end="00:47:01.070" style="s2">this story is Aaron dies and he has a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.780" end="00:47:05.670" style="s2">son called a lot see that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.070" end="00:47:09.540" style="s2">the idea is it&#39;s the same idea the son</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.670" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">of this Herrin he represents death he</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.540" end="00:47:15.810" style="s2">represents the thing we can&#39;t handle he</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:18.300" style="s2">represents the material facts that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.810" end="00:47:20.970" style="s2">can explain with with our theories or</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.300" end="00:47:22.560" style="s2">with our identity is the thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.970" end="00:47:25.110" style="s2">the matter we can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.560" end="00:47:29.630" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s why in story starts with</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.110" end="00:47:34.370" style="s2">he dies the father of lots tax it means</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.630" end="00:47:39.290" style="s2">lot represents some fact that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.370" end="00:47:42.030" style="s2">correctly integrate into our universe</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.290" end="00:47:45.240" style="s2">this could be interpreted in so many</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.030" end="00:47:46.860" style="s2">different levels but that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.240" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">what this I don&#39;t know if that makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.860" end="00:47:52.590" style="s2">sense but the idea yeah I mean the idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">is that is the I think we need to see it</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.590" end="00:47:58.350" style="s2">the idea that an orphan or a widow</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:59.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what they always represent the DA</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.350" end="00:48:01.950" style="s2">represents something that have lost</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.640" end="00:48:03.990" style="s2">their their principle that unifies them</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.950" end="00:48:05.580" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of various</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.990" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">connected from the hierarchy of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.580" end="00:48:09.390" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:11.190" style="s2">so so so lot losing is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.390" end="00:48:13.380" style="s2">losing us father died means that he</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.190" end="00:48:15.870" style="s2">loses the thing that gives him identity</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.380" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">and so he&#39;s like this he&#39;s like a piece</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.870" end="00:48:20.370" style="s2">of Earth that his lost attachment or</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:24.660" style="s2">lost meaning or well that that reminds</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.370" end="00:48:30.210" style="s2">me of what happens to Noah&#39;s son</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.660" end="00:48:34.289" style="s2">who sees him naked yeah right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.210" end="00:48:36.299" style="s2">and why they just because because to see</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.289" end="00:48:40.349" style="s2">it seems to me I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.299" end="00:48:42.539" style="s2">this a little bit tonight that to see no</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.349" end="00:48:44.579" style="s2">one gets drunk and then which which Sun</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.539" end="00:48:48.119" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.579" end="00:48:50.549" style="s2">ham ham yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.119" end="00:48:52.410" style="s2">first sees him but doesn&#39;t respond</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.549" end="00:48:55.319" style="s2">properly the other sons when they see</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.410" end="00:48:57.240" style="s2">Noah naked they cover him up and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.319" end="00:48:59.579" style="s2">don&#39;t look and so it&#39;s like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.240" end="00:49:03.780" style="s2">exposing their father&#39;s weakness his</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.579" end="00:49:06.089" style="s2">mortality his is his insufficiency right</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.780" end="00:49:08.069" style="s2">they had attained respect but but ham</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.089" end="00:49:10.049" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do that but there&#39;s also more</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.069" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">what Matthew was talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.049" end="00:49:14.039" style="s2">the in that story there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:15.539" style="s2">that are implied of what Matthew was</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.039" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">talking about before this idea of wine</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.539" end="00:49:21.539" style="s2">that brings you into this cycle where</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:24.809" style="s2">causality ceases to be direct and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.539" end="00:49:27.089" style="s2">what Pam told the fashion yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.809" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">fact that hem sees his father naked he</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.089" end="00:49:33.569" style="s2">discovers his nakedness is also a kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:36.809" style="s2">of suggestion of incest as well the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.569" end="00:49:39.690" style="s2">type the same type of inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.809" end="00:49:43.349" style="s2">causality that you be in the story of</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.690" end="00:49:45.480" style="s2">the two of a Abraham&#39;s sister marrying</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.349" end="00:49:46.140" style="s2">this writer right yeah and a lot with</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:51.839" style="s2">transgression to give some fun</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.789" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">transgression against some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.839" end="00:49:57.960" style="s2">boundary yeah I guess the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:50:01.589" style="s2">hierarchical relationship and of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.960" end="00:50:04.740" style="s2">family right yes they&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.589" end="00:50:06.390" style="s2">make loops focus it&#39;s a tree you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.740" end="00:50:08.760" style="s2">supposed to make loops in a tree so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.390" end="00:50:10.619" style="s2">can say like that it&#39;s really simple and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.760" end="00:50:13.079" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to regress and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.619" end="00:50:14.789" style="s2">supposed to you produce things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.079" end="00:50:16.740" style="s2">not supposed to turn back on yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.789" end="00:50:19.289" style="s2">okay you&#39;re not supposed to go back</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.740" end="00:50:21.029" style="s2">contradict ourselves okay so so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.289" end="00:50:24.809" style="s2">that&#39;s why Lot&#39;s wife is turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.029" end="00:50:27.059" style="s2">pillar of salt to she lay back right</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.809" end="00:50:32.299" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.059" end="00:50:34.770" style="s2">listen experimental and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.299" end="00:50:37.589" style="s2">pines for something that that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.770" end="00:50:38.200" style="s2">terrible they shouldn&#39;t be and so and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.589" end="00:50:39.700" style="s2">she&#39;s come out</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.200" end="00:50:42.099" style="s2">not to look back once she once you</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.700" end="00:50:43.990" style="s2">escape from that catastrophe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.099" end="00:50:45.579" style="s2">get to be nostalgic for it the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.990" end="00:50:47.260" style="s2">thing happens in the story of Moses</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.579" end="00:50:48.460" style="s2">because what happens to the Israelites</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.260" end="00:50:51.970" style="s2">when they&#39;re out in the desert is they</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.460" end="00:50:54.520" style="s2">start to become nostalgic for Egypt for</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.970" end="00:50:56.410" style="s2">the tyranny yet right and that&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.520" end="00:50:58.810" style="s2">think when God starts to send poisonous</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.410" end="00:51:00.790" style="s2">snakes among them because right though</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.810" end="00:51:03.220" style="s2">don&#39;t they they start to pine for Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.790" end="00:51:05.020" style="s2">and complain about Moses and then they</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.220" end="00:51:06.310" style="s2">start to worship other idols so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.020" end="00:51:07.869" style="s2">part of that confusion that you were</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.310" end="00:51:09.460" style="s2">talking about and then God gets</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.869" end="00:51:10.900" style="s2">irritated and throws a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.460" end="00:51:14.470" style="s2">poisonous snakes in there to give them a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.900" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">good chomping yeah so I call that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.470" end="00:51:22.060" style="s2">snakes come as a result of them wanting</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">to go back yeah yeah well right that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.060" end="00:51:27.369" style="s2">makes perfect sense so and you see that</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:28.930" style="s2">nostalgia for tyranny you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.369" end="00:51:34.540" style="s2">that the Soviet nor in Russia right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.930" end="00:51:36.220" style="s2">in regards to Stalin and so the question</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.540" end="00:51:38.589" style="s2">the question is I think this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.220" end="00:51:42.220" style="s2">the things that the guy who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.589" end="00:51:44.950" style="s2">disappearance of God mentioned is do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.220" end="00:51:48.609" style="s2">want to be well fed as a slave or hungry</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.950" end="00:51:50.980" style="s2">and freedom something like that and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.609" end="00:51:55.480" style="s2">choice well fed as a slave is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.980" end="00:51:57.130" style="s2">choice yeah so okay now so in Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.480" end="00:52:00.760" style="s2">you and I had talked to fair bit about</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.130" end="00:52:06.310" style="s2">the story of Abraham and the strangers</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.760" end="00:52:10.630" style="s2">and before so so God decides to reward</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.310" end="00:52:12.190" style="s2">Abraham and he tells him that just like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.630" end="00:52:16.540" style="s2">he told him before but he repeats it</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.190" end="00:52:21.130" style="s2">that he&#39;s going to be the the founder of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.540" end="00:52:26.890" style="s2">the nation and he and he tells them that</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.130" end="00:52:31.140" style="s2">Sarah is going to bear a child and Sarah</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.890" end="00:52:34.000" style="s2">of course is not doesn&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.140" end="00:52:36.990" style="s2">let&#39;s see let me let me just find this</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.000" end="00:52:36.990" style="s2">here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.579" end="00:52:46.239" style="s2">yes okay so that&#39;s what happens is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.799" end="00:52:47.949" style="s2">is that God&#39;s God God&#39;s word comes in to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.239" end="00:52:50.409" style="s2">Abraham in a vision so it&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.949" end="00:52:54.009" style="s2">again saying that his reward will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.409" end="00:52:55.689" style="s2">great and that he&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.009" end="00:52:57.639" style="s2">father of Nations but he doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.689" end="00:53:01.929" style="s2">any children and so isn&#39;t that when he</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.639" end="00:53:06.059" style="s2">takes you take Farrah&#39;s servant Hagar</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.929" end="00:53:10.409" style="s2">yeah and and that gives rise to Ishmael</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.059" end="00:53:16.179" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t until later that Sarah is</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.409" end="00:53:18.429" style="s2">informed that she&#39;s going sorry sir your</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.179" end="00:53:20.229" style="s2">hopes up man turning the key one fancy</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.429" end="00:53:22.569" style="s2">request this you want fancier quietly</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.229" end="00:53:27.489" style="s2">I&#39;d be curious to know what she has</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.569" end="00:53:29.859" style="s2">found yeah you should look guys close</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.489" end="00:53:32.949" style="s2">her down yeah I know it&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.859" end="00:53:35.019" style="s2">intermission there so okay so so abraham</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.949" end="00:53:38.589" style="s2">has to take a kind of a detour in order</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.019" end="00:53:41.469" style="s2">to have a child and he lays with Hagar</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.589" end="00:53:43.799" style="s2">and Hagar we don&#39;t know much about her</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.469" end="00:53:50.919" style="s2">but she gets haughty right away and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.799" end="00:53:53.289" style="s2">starts to despise Sarai and Sarai</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.919" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">actually beats her as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.289" end="00:53:59.679" style="s2">it says Sarah dealt hardly with her and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:54:04.259" style="s2">then Hagar flees and she ends up by a</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.679" end="00:54:09.519" style="s2">well where an angel appears to her and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.259" end="00:54:12.489" style="s2">the angel tells her that her son her</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.519" end="00:54:18.849" style="s2">child is going to be the father of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.489" end="00:54:25.149" style="s2">nation as well so so the first question</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.849" end="00:54:28.959" style="s2">might be why is it that Abraham at this</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.149" end="00:54:30.609" style="s2">point in the story why is it necessary</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.959" end="00:54:34.119" style="s2">for the story that Abraham takes a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.609" end="00:54:37.269" style="s2">detour and has a child with Hagar what</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.119" end="00:54:40.089" style="s2">do you think is a signifier it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.269" end="00:54:44.589" style="s2">always the same problem in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.089" end="00:54:48.249" style="s2">it&#39;s always it starts with confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.589" end="00:54:50.560" style="s2">it has to develop towards something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.249" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">is clear</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.560" end="00:54:54.820" style="s2">so you&#39;re saying it yourself when you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:58.800" style="s2">say detour yeah it&#39;s a detour exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.820" end="00:55:02.970" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what it is it&#39;s a detour</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.800" end="00:55:06.040" style="s2">okay that&#39;s not necessary but it happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.970" end="00:55:08.560" style="s2">then they say well isn&#39;t there such as</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.040" end="00:55:10.690" style="s2">these detours or if the others are</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.560" end="00:55:12.550" style="s2">things that are not necessary but happen</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.690" end="00:55:14.020" style="s2">there&#39;s something also in that detour</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.550" end="00:55:16.750" style="s2">the fact that that he gives birth to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.020" end="00:55:19.270" style="s2">Ishmael which has to do with this this</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.750" end="00:55:21.610" style="s2">turning because God kind of promises</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.270" end="00:55:23.980" style="s2">that Ishmael is going to come back and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.610" end="00:55:25.540" style="s2">is going to be a big problem for you</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.980" end="00:55:27.100" style="s2">he&#39;s going to be a father of a great</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.540" end="00:55:28.690" style="s2">nation but it&#39;s going to be a big</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.100" end="00:55:30.240" style="s2">problem for you later like this going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.690" end="00:55:34.120" style="s2">be there&#39;s going to be fighting between</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.240" end="00:55:36.280" style="s2">between your sons basically yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.120" end="00:55:37.990" style="s2">that idea yeah of course here you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.280" end="00:55:41.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in that story but</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.990" end="00:55:43.720" style="s2">yeah well ASO seems to be associated</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.560" end="00:55:46.380" style="s2">with an idea that you might think about</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.720" end="00:55:50.560" style="s2">as successive approximation to an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.380" end="00:55:53.800" style="s2">you know so one of the things that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.560" end="00:55:56.710" style="s2">I conceptualize sort of visually is this</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.800" end="00:55:57.700" style="s2">is associated with the idea of Geppetto</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.710" end="00:56:00.100" style="s2">wishing on a star</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.700" end="00:56:01.630" style="s2">you know so what Geppetto does when he</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.100" end="00:56:04.210" style="s2">wants to facilitate the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.630" end="00:56:06.190" style="s2">of Pinocchio is lift his eyes up to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.210" end="00:56:09.340" style="s2">highest thing that he can conceive up</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.190" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">and Orient&#39;s himself with that but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.340" end="00:56:13.480" style="s2">thing is is that as you move through</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:15.130" style="s2">life let&#39;s say you&#39;re oriented by the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.480" end="00:56:17.350" style="s2">highest thing you can conceive of but as</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.130" end="00:56:20.050" style="s2">you move towards it you transform and</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.350" end="00:56:22.090" style="s2">then and your conceptualization of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.050" end="00:56:24.130" style="s2">what&#39;s the highest shifts as you</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.090" end="00:56:26.830" style="s2">transform so you&#39;re aiming at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.130" end="00:56:28.360" style="s2">highest thing but but your perhaps your</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.830" end="00:56:29.950" style="s2">ability to conceptualize what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.360" end="00:56:32.860" style="s2">highest thing develops as you move</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.950" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">towards it and so but what that means in</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.860" end="00:56:36.550" style="s2">practice is that you do take detours</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:38.950" style="s2">because you aim at something but your</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.550" end="00:56:40.750" style="s2">aim is off and you move towards it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.950" end="00:56:42.940" style="s2">then you get to a point where you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.750" end="00:56:45.160" style="s2">correct your aim and so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.940" end="00:56:47.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve made a mistake exactly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.160" end="00:56:49.780" style="s2">you&#39;re farther ahead than you were and</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.080" end="00:56:52.060" style="s2">you&#39;ve corrected your aim but your aim</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.780" end="00:56:56.650" style="s2">wasn&#39;t you weren&#39;t aiming at exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.060" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">right thing to begin with and so now go</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.650" end="00:57:00.970" style="s2">ahead well maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:03.910" style="s2">to Abraham is that you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.970" end="00:57:04.059" style="s2">almost say I don&#39;t know that Ishmael is</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.910" end="00:57:09.779" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.059" end="00:57:12.549" style="s2">practice run something like that well so</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.779" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">all right so then you were going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.549" end="00:57:16.959" style="s2">Matthew you were going to say something</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.839" end="00:57:24.359" style="s2">about that oh yeah I was going to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.959" end="00:57:27.489" style="s2">that exile in the Bible there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.359" end="00:57:30.249" style="s2">reason for it but it&#39;s not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.489" end="00:57:32.049" style="s2">logical reason it&#39;s it&#39;s just like what</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.249" end="00:57:33.609" style="s2">you described you think you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.049" end="00:57:35.079" style="s2">something you think you&#39;d know what</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.609" end="00:57:36.279" style="s2">you&#39;re aiming at you think you know what</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.079" end="00:57:38.650" style="s2">you want you think you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.279" end="00:57:41.019" style="s2">doing something happens that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.650" end="00:57:43.239" style="s2">plan and that doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.019" end="00:57:45.519" style="s2">part of what you were aiming it makes</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.239" end="00:57:47.349" style="s2">you take a detour well this this side is</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.519" end="00:57:48.849" style="s2">all about detours it&#39;s all about turning</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.349" end="00:57:52.959" style="s2">around you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.849" end="00:57:55.660" style="s2">you&#39;re lost so but in the end if it</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.959" end="00:57:57.880" style="s2">brings about something that maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.660" end="00:58:00.789" style="s2">weren&#39;t even aiming at in the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.880" end="00:58:02.650" style="s2">place yeah but might be better than what</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.789" end="00:58:04.900" style="s2">you were in in the first place so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.650" end="00:58:08.920" style="s2">not all bad so I think that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.900" end="00:58:15.989" style="s2">the idea of the whole idea of exile is</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.920" end="00:58:19.539" style="s2">that there it renews your plans right</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.989" end="00:58:23.739" style="s2">if you don&#39;t die yeah if you don&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.539" end="00:58:27.400" style="s2">ha ha ha ha yeah even if you do die for</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.739" end="00:58:28.900" style="s2">New York life well yeah ok ok so now ok</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.400" end="00:58:32.979" style="s2">so now the next thing that happens is</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.900" end="00:58:38.259" style="s2">that the strangers come to visit Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.979" end="00:58:40.900" style="s2">and he treats them hospitably and so now</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.259" end="00:58:43.630" style="s2">we might say that that&#39;s an indication</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.900" end="00:58:45.880" style="s2">of his increasing alignment with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.630" end="00:58:49.299" style="s2">good maybe that&#39;s one way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.880" end="00:58:52.989" style="s2">about it because he does right by the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.299" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">stranger and one of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.989" end="00:58:56.829" style="s2">that is that the angels I guess we find</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:58:58.689" style="s2">out that they&#39;re angels</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.829" end="00:59:02.439" style="s2">tell him that Sarah is going to give</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.689" end="00:59:03.999" style="s2">birth to someone and Abraham finds that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.439" end="00:59:05.259" style="s2">very difficult to believe it Sarah finds</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.999" end="00:59:07.329" style="s2">it so difficult to believe that she</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.259" end="00:59:10.809" style="s2">actually laughs about it she overhears</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.329" end="00:59:14.109" style="s2">it she laughs about it but but he he has</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.809" end="00:59:16.719" style="s2">the strangers he feeds them and he has</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.109" end="00:59:18.420" style="s2">them wash their feet if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.719" end="00:59:20.680" style="s2">correctly and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.420" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">anyways he treats them hospitably it</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.680" end="00:59:24.760" style="s2">well and there&#39;s a blessing as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:26.470" style="s2">consequence of that and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.760" end="00:59:29.470" style="s2">we talked about a fair bit Jonathan when</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.470" end="00:59:31.900" style="s2">we were talking about Tom the thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.470" end="00:59:34.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit in categories yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.900" end="00:59:36.010" style="s2">stranger yeah which is that invitation</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.180" end="00:59:38.339" style="s2">to chaos as well that you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.010" end="00:59:40.150" style="s2">about Matthew because the stranger is</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.339" end="00:59:41.619" style="s2">well the thing that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.150" end="00:59:45.220" style="s2">subjugated to but also something that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.619" end="00:59:46.599" style="s2">will bring something new and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.220" end="00:59:48.940" style="s2">disruptive but also potentially</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.599" end="00:59:51.880" style="s2">beneficial and so then the idea there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.940" end="00:59:54.250" style="s2">whether or not the stranger is</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.880" end="00:59:55.960" style="s2">disruptive or beneficial depends to a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.250" end="01:00:00.040" style="s2">large degree on how you treat the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.960" end="01:00:01.809" style="s2">stranger and that&#39;s that strikes me as</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.040" end="01:00:03.819" style="s2">very very possible I mean that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.809" end="01:00:05.799" style="s2">thing that that&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.819" end="01:00:09.880" style="s2">has really entered my imagination as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.799" end="01:00:14.650" style="s2">clinician know if you&#39;re approached by</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.880" end="01:00:16.420" style="s2">someone who&#39;s very in chaos the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.650" end="01:00:18.369" style="s2">consequence of that is very dependent on</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.420" end="01:00:20.770" style="s2">how you interact with them because it</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.369" end="01:00:23.460" style="s2">can go any way and they&#39;re not really in</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.770" end="01:00:27.460" style="s2">control because there&#39;s so chaotic and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.460" end="01:00:29.559" style="s2">so if you&#39;re careful and awake you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.460" end="01:00:31.990" style="s2">keep things moving in the proper</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.559" end="01:00:35.700" style="s2">direction and maybe even benefit from it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.990" end="01:00:38.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of like the idea of Noah</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.700" end="01:00:39.430" style="s2">walking with God because one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.020" end="01:00:42.369" style="s2">reasons that Noah gets through the flood</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.430" end="01:00:46.150" style="s2">is because he&#39;s oriented properly he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.369" end="01:00:47.010" style="s2">walking with God and so you could say</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.150" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.010" end="01:00:53.079" style="s2">exile can it&#39;s something like exile can</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:56.829" style="s2">expand you if you stay properly oriented</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.079" end="01:00:59.859" style="s2">while you&#39;re in exile it can fix it can</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.829" end="01:01:03.609" style="s2">fix your mistakes that&#39;s part of it it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.859" end="01:01:04.359" style="s2">cleans you it renews you because you</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.609" end="01:01:06.460" style="s2">make mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.359" end="01:01:07.750" style="s2">yeah and they become part of you and if</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.460" end="01:01:09.579" style="s2">you&#39;re just stuck with your mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.750" end="01:01:12.549" style="s2">you&#39;re rigid about your own mistakes you</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.579" end="01:01:14.109" style="s2">need something outer to something that</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.549" end="01:01:16.059" style="s2">you don&#39;t know something that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.109" end="01:01:16.329" style="s2">understand the clean you&#39;re like takes</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.059" end="01:01:18.130" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.329" end="01:01:19.780" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s like the gold the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.130" end="01:01:22.089" style="s2">dragon hordes with a virgin that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.780" end="01:01:24.069" style="s2">dragon hordes right it&#39;s it&#39;s if the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.089" end="01:01:27.010" style="s2">dragon represents that chaotic would say</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.069" end="01:01:29.530" style="s2">exile state the drag or the gold and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.010" end="01:01:30.910" style="s2">and the virgin both represent that which</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.530" end="01:01:33.490" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.910" end="01:01:35.950" style="s2">assimilated as a consequence of being in</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.490" end="01:01:39.670" style="s2">that situation the funny thing is is in</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.950" end="01:01:42.039" style="s2">the hero myths going into exile on</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.670" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">purpose works way better than going into</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.039" end="01:01:48.700" style="s2">exile accidentally yeah so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:50.799" style="s2">interesting thing so okay okay so now</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.700" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">well can I say something about the part</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.799" end="01:01:54.369" style="s2">you were describing the whole story of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:57.809" style="s2">Abraham if you look at the big picture</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.369" end="01:02:01.299" style="s2">it&#39;s really about progressive</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.809" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">progressively knowing something so it</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.299" end="01:02:07.869" style="s2">starts with just the voice okay oh god</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:09.490" style="s2">go here doesn&#39;t mean much goes there</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.869" end="01:02:11.799" style="s2">then it becomes a little more precise I</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.490" end="01:02:14.950" style="s2">will give you this land but is more</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.799" end="01:02:18.579" style="s2">specific and then as the further he goes</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.950" end="01:02:21.220" style="s2">the more it becomes explicit what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.579" end="01:02:23.319" style="s2">going to happen so I&#39;ll give you a son</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.220" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">when I don&#39;t know someday</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.319" end="01:02:28.180" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t say later on it becomes more</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:30.930" style="s2">and more explicit okay and he says like</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.180" end="01:02:34.930" style="s2">in the party were talking about he says</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.930" end="01:02:38.319" style="s2">three men come these are angels as it</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.930" end="01:02:42.010" style="s2">becomes clear later so this is God right</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.319" end="01:02:45.730" style="s2">pod sending his message in a clear</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.010" end="01:02:49.000" style="s2">manner and it&#39;s more right specific than</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.730" end="01:02:51.010" style="s2">before he says this time next year you</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.000" end="01:02:51.910" style="s2">will have it&#39;s okay so okay so a couple</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.010" end="01:02:58.029" style="s2">of things about that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.910" end="01:02:59.619" style="s2">so yes one of the things that see one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.029" end="01:03:01.270" style="s2">the ways that I&#39;ve conceptualized the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.619" end="01:03:02.740" style="s2">relationship between the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.270" end="01:03:04.690" style="s2">and the New Testament and I this is kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.740" end="01:03:07.480" style="s2">of a classic Christian conceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.690" end="01:03:10.000" style="s2">I think and it&#39;s also it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.480" end="01:03:11.289" style="s2">analogous to what happens to Moses</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.000" end="01:03:12.690" style="s2">because Moses doesn&#39;t get to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.289" end="01:03:15.309" style="s2">promised land so there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.690" end="01:03:16.900" style="s2">Christian idea that the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.309" end="01:03:19.420" style="s2">Moses can&#39;t get to the promised land is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.900" end="01:03:21.309" style="s2">because he only represents the law now</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.420" end="01:03:25.660" style="s2">but then I thought about that I thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.309" end="01:03:27.609" style="s2">well one of the I&#39;ve got to say about</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.660" end="01:03:30.400" style="s2">four stories at the same time here to</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.609" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">man to get the bill as I&#39;m right so the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.400" end="01:03:34.630" style="s2">first is it&#39;s not so easy to speak the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:38.890" style="s2">truth but it&#39;s fairly easy to stop lying</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.630" end="01:03:41.170" style="s2">and so as you stop lying you get better</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.890" end="01:03:42.670" style="s2">you get to approximate speaking the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.170" end="01:03:44.349" style="s2">truth but the way you start isn&#39;t by</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.670" end="01:03:44.740" style="s2">speaking the truth the way you start is</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.349" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.740" end="01:03:48.610" style="s2">stopping line and then a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:50.500" style="s2">rules in the Old Testament are</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.610" end="01:03:52.210" style="s2">prohibitions here&#39;s a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.500" end="01:03:54.280" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t do that you might be</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.210" end="01:03:56.380" style="s2">inclined to do and so the idea there</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.280" end="01:03:58.300" style="s2">would be if you stop doing all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.380" end="01:04:00.250" style="s2">things you know you shouldn&#39;t do then</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.300" end="01:04:01.960" style="s2">you can your head clears up enough so</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.250" end="01:04:04.480" style="s2">you can start to see the things that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.960" end="01:04:06.550" style="s2">should do and so then in the Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.480" end="01:04:08.790" style="s2">story maybe it&#39;s something like this</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.550" end="01:04:11.590" style="s2">you said you implied Matthew that</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.790" end="01:04:14.710" style="s2">Abraham had originally follows something</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.590" end="01:04:16.360" style="s2">like a vague and he&#39;ll defined whim but</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.710" end="01:04:18.520" style="s2">he has enough faith to move forward</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.360" end="01:04:21.280" style="s2">despite the fact that it&#39;s vague and</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.520" end="01:04:23.220" style="s2">ill-defined and then as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.280" end="01:04:26.230" style="s2">moving forward it becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.220" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">concretize dand and differentiated and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.230" end="01:04:30.280" style="s2">clear okay that&#39;s right man because</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:31.990" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s funny because the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.280" end="01:04:33.880" style="s2">future authoring program we&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.990" end="01:04:36.520" style="s2">is sort of predicated on that idea the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.880" end="01:04:39.400" style="s2">first thing you do is wander around in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.520" end="01:04:41.830" style="s2">kind of confused days trying to find a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.400" end="01:04:44.470" style="s2">direction of orientation and then you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.830" end="01:04:45.790" style="s2">clarify that and partly you do that by</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.470" end="01:04:49.480" style="s2">continuing to think about it but you</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.790" end="01:04:53.050" style="s2">also clarify it by acting on it okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.480" end="01:04:56.369" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s the idea these three men</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.050" end="01:04:59.410" style="s2">that come visit him</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.369" end="01:05:02.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason whether it&#39;s three okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.410" end="01:05:04.930" style="s2">it&#39;s because it&#39;s it&#39;s trying to express</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.050" end="01:05:07.810" style="s2">the idea that it&#39;s more expressed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.930" end="01:05:09.940" style="s2">more explicit it&#39;s not just the seed</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.810" end="01:05:11.619" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a branch</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.940" end="01:05:12.910" style="s2">okay you&#39;ve got up here you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.619" end="01:05:17.050" style="s2">something that looks like a branch it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.910" end="01:05:19.420" style="s2">branching out into a more concrete thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.050" end="01:05:22.780" style="s2">and at first it&#39;s just a voice then its</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.420" end="01:05:24.220" style="s2">division then it&#39;s actual people okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.780" end="01:05:29.430" style="s2">Shay okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.220" end="01:05:29.430" style="s2">so here&#39;s another idea so</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.160" end="01:05:37.269" style="s2">let&#39;s say if you&#39;re beginning to develop</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.630" end="01:05:40.029" style="s2">morality you you behave so that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.269" end="01:05:41.009" style="s2">people who share your morality can get</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.029" end="01:05:44.289" style="s2">along with you</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.009" end="01:05:45.549" style="s2">that means you follow the rules but if</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.289" end="01:05:48.249" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with strangers it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.549" end="01:05:50.650" style="s2">different issue because they aren&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.249" end="01:05:52.809" style="s2">of your morality and so the question</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.650" end="01:05:54.160" style="s2">then is how do you act properly when</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.809" end="01:05:56.499" style="s2">you&#39;re not in the domain of your</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.160" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">morality and I always thought about that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.499" end="01:06:00.369" style="s2">as a meta moral domain and it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.960" end="01:06:02.769" style="s2">me that it&#39;s the domain that Christ</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.369" end="01:06:04.569" style="s2">occupies because he&#39;s he&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.769" end="01:06:07.869" style="s2">mediator between morality</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.569" end="01:06:11.019" style="s2">he&#39;s in no man&#39;s land and is a mediator</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.869" end="01:06:13.420" style="s2">between morality Xand and if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.019" end="01:06:14.950" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;ve oriented yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.420" end="01:06:16.630" style="s2">properly then you even know how to act</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.950" end="01:06:18.339" style="s2">with there aren&#39;t any rules and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.630" end="01:06:20.349" style="s2">why Abraham can act properly in</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.339" end="01:06:22.239" style="s2">relationship to the strangers he&#39;s awake</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.349" end="01:06:25.299" style="s2">enough so that when the strangers show</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.239" end="01:06:26.950" style="s2">up shows up he can pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.299" end="01:06:29.950" style="s2">way they&#39;re acting and can act</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.950" end="01:06:32.950" style="s2">spontaneously as a consequence of paying</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.950" end="01:06:35.259" style="s2">attention and things go well and so the</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.950" end="01:06:36.579" style="s2">strangers aren&#39;t hostile they don&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.259" end="01:06:37.690" style="s2">him they don&#39;t take his wife they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.579" end="01:06:39.279" style="s2">do any of the terrible things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.690" end="01:06:41.680" style="s2">strangers could do and he gets a</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.279" end="01:06:44.369" style="s2">blessing as a consequence of it that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.680" end="01:06:44.369" style="s2">seemed reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.999" end="01:06:54.759" style="s2">it is but we have to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.430" end="01:06:56.529" style="s2">these strangers are come from heaven in</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.759" end="01:06:57.849" style="s2">the sense that they&#39;ve bringing a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.529" end="01:07:01.150" style="s2">message they&#39;re not just random</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.849" end="01:07:03.160" style="s2">strangers very they&#39;re sent well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.150" end="01:07:05.829" style="s2">he would have acted the same way with</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.160" end="01:07:07.749" style="s2">strangers that wasn&#39;t sent and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.829" end="01:07:10.210" style="s2">the whole point he doesn&#39;t know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.749" end="01:07:12.369" style="s2">right we act in a way that allows for</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.210" end="01:07:14.289" style="s2">that yeah yeah for the one that accent</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.369" end="01:07:15.700" style="s2">okay here is Eve okay so that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.289" end="01:07:18.759" style="s2">interesting too because one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.700" end="01:07:20.680" style="s2">things that I think you see happening as</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.759" end="01:07:23.249" style="s2">a consequence of the transition from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.680" end="01:07:27.279" style="s2">Old Testament to the New Testament is</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.249" end="01:07:29.950" style="s2">that part of Christ&#39;s message is to act</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.279" end="01:07:32.109" style="s2">in exactly that way is to act in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.950" end="01:07:34.180" style="s2">manner that allows for the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.109" end="01:07:36.009" style="s2">of the emergence of the good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.180" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">something like that&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.009" end="01:07:40.390" style="s2">what would you describe as a description</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:41.979" style="s2">of the necessity of faith and you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.390" end="01:07:43.690" style="s2">like let&#39;s say you stretch out your hand</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.979" end="01:07:45.730" style="s2">to someone in trust</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.690" end="01:07:47.800" style="s2">should be naive but it&#39;s a precondition</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.730" end="01:07:49.420" style="s2">for good things happening AG if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.800" end="01:07:51.069" style="s2">distrustful and you have every reason to</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.420" end="01:07:53.710" style="s2">be because people are full of snakes if</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.069" end="01:07:56.200" style="s2">you&#39;re distrustful you foreclose the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.710" end="01:07:58.359" style="s2">opportunity for cooperative progress</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.200" end="01:08:01.240" style="s2">instantly you might protect yourself</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.359" end="01:08:03.910" style="s2">against being bitten now net so so there</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.240" end="01:08:05.829" style="s2">is a dramatic relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.910" end="01:08:07.930" style="s2">manner in which you open yourself up to</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.829" end="01:08:10.780" style="s2">the world and the way the world treats</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.930" end="01:08:13.480" style="s2">you and one of the things that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.780" end="01:08:15.220" style="s2">be really emphasized it&#39;s more implicit</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.480" end="01:08:18.699" style="s2">in the Old Testament more explicit the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.220" end="01:08:20.830" style="s2">New Testament is that the more you open</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.699" end="01:08:22.509" style="s2">yourself up to the possibility that good</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.830" end="01:08:24.279" style="s2">things will happen and that&#39;s partly by</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.509" end="01:08:26.410" style="s2">accepting your vulnerability as far as I</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.279" end="01:08:29.790" style="s2">can tell the higher the probability is</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.410" end="01:08:29.790" style="s2">that good things will in fact happen</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.880" end="01:08:38.650" style="s2">yeah I mean I would definitely say that</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.989" end="01:08:40.150" style="s2">in the story of Abraham the like we were</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.650" end="01:08:43.690" style="s2">kind of flirting around that idea before</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.150" end="01:08:45.580" style="s2">is that the reason why he was able to to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.690" end="01:08:47.109" style="s2">receive them as these angels that they</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.580" end="01:08:49.270" style="s2">were able to manifest themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.109" end="01:08:51.460" style="s2">these angels was because he was willing</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.270" end="01:08:54.310" style="s2">to host them properly eat he like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.460" end="01:08:58.150" style="s2">as if his family just like Sarah like</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.310" end="01:08:59.859" style="s2">Sarah is is he was the right ground for</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.150" end="01:09:01.870" style="s2">that manifestation at that time right</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.859" end="01:09:03.130" style="s2">well yeah I would say that they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.870" end="01:09:05.350" style="s2">have been angels if he wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.130" end="01:09:06.910" style="s2">treated them properly well he might have</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.350" end="01:09:08.259" style="s2">been here but they might have done they</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.910" end="01:09:11.410" style="s2">might have done what they did in Sodom</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.259" end="01:09:13.449" style="s2">and Gomorrah like that&#39;s the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.410" end="01:09:14.980" style="s2">okay so now I want to switch I want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.449" end="01:09:17.469" style="s2">flip the head a little bit this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.980" end="01:09:19.210" style="s2">really what I this is I think of all the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.469" end="01:09:20.739" style="s2">things I wanted to discuss with you guys</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.210" end="01:09:27.430" style="s2">I think this is the one that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.739" end="01:09:29.650" style="s2">crucial because okay so now we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.430" end="01:09:31.630" style="s2">let&#39;s say we&#39;re in Sodom with the with</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.650" end="01:09:34.480" style="s2">the angels and we&#39;re in the part of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.630" end="01:09:36.819" style="s2">story where the townspeople have Sodom</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.480" end="01:09:38.830" style="s2">gather around the house and they tell</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.819" end="01:09:40.799" style="s2">law and unless he throws out the</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.830" end="01:09:44.170" style="s2">strangers so that they can be raped</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.799" end="01:09:48.160" style="s2">well the townspeople demand that and</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.170" end="01:09:50.739" style="s2">then law it offers them his daughters</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.160" end="01:09:54.069" style="s2">which seems like a hell of a thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.739" end="01:09:55.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like the sacrifice of Isaac to some</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.069" end="01:09:56.690" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.640" end="01:09:58.520" style="s2">what it looks like to me because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.690" end="01:10:01.850" style="s2">willing to sacrifice his daughters to</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.520" end="01:10:03.560" style="s2">protect the strangers now okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.850" end="01:10:05.830" style="s2">a morally let&#39;s call that a morally</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.560" end="01:10:10.970" style="s2">ambiguous element of the story but then</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.830" end="01:10:13.000" style="s2">the townspeople reject out and they tell</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.970" end="01:10:15.890" style="s2">they basically tell him that he has no</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.000" end="01:10:17.000" style="s2">right or power to bargain and that not</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.890" end="01:10:18.200" style="s2">only are they going to take his</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.000" end="01:10:20.990" style="s2">daughters but they&#39;re also going to take</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.200" end="01:10:23.720" style="s2">the stranger&#39;s so it doesn&#39;t work but</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.990" end="01:10:24.980" style="s2">you know to modern sensibility the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.720" end="01:10:28.100" style="s2">offering of his daughters is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.980" end="01:10:30.020" style="s2">reprehensible thing but it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.100" end="01:10:32.870" style="s2">that in the context of the story it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.020" end="01:10:35.000" style="s2">indication of how hard Lotte is trying</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.870" end="01:10:36.170" style="s2">to treat the strangers properly in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.000" end="01:10:38.600" style="s2">place where that&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.170" end="01:10:41.890" style="s2">impossible yes that&#39;s the whole point of</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.600" end="01:10:45.080" style="s2">that story that place is impossible</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.890" end="01:10:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point I think what he</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.080" end="01:10:50.870" style="s2">just said okay there&#39;s no way out of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.400" end="01:10:53.090" style="s2">right Leonard Cohen said something about</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.870" end="01:10:55.520" style="s2">that he said there&#39;s he had a line that</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.090" end="01:10:57.500" style="s2">I remember quite well he said there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.520" end="01:10:59.870" style="s2">decent place to stand in the massacre</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.500" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">and what that seems to mean is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.870" end="01:11:05.240" style="s2">something it&#39;s something like you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:07.880" style="s2">get into a place where that&#39;s made of</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.240" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">such a compound of errors and deceit and</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.880" end="01:11:12.350" style="s2">catastrophe that no matter which way you</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:14.510" style="s2">turn there is no good yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.350" end="01:11:17.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen people like that my clinical</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.510" end="01:11:19.670" style="s2">practice there&#39;s there&#39;s no good there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.120" end="01:11:21.320" style="s2">no good alternative everything is sin</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.670" end="01:11:22.820" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good way of no matter</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.320" end="01:11:24.380" style="s2">which way you shake your you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.820" end="01:11:26.330" style="s2">going to hit the mark because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.380" end="01:11:30.620" style="s2">somewhere where the mark can be hit okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.330" end="01:11:32.210" style="s2">now I&#39;ve been trying to think about the</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.620" end="01:11:36.370" style="s2">story of Sodom and Gomorrah in</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.210" end="01:11:39.260" style="s2">relationship to modern sexual confusion</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.370" end="01:11:42.050" style="s2">so this is what I see happening on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.260" end="01:11:44.330" style="s2">social justice front let&#39;s say on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.050" end="01:11:45.860" style="s2">one hand since the 1960&#39;s and probably</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.330" end="01:11:48.320" style="s2">has a consequence of the birth control</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.860" end="01:11:50.870" style="s2">pill but other factors as well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.320" end="01:11:53.840" style="s2">been tremendous stress placed on sexual</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.870" end="01:11:57.110" style="s2">liberation and so there&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.840" end="01:11:58.790" style="s2">I think is associated in large part</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.110" end="01:12:01.700" style="s2">right now with the radical left of total</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.790" end="01:12:04.940" style="s2">sexual freedom but at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.700" end="01:12:09.290" style="s2">there&#39;s increasing emphasis from exactly</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.940" end="01:12:11.300" style="s2">the same sources on restricting sexual</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.290" end="01:12:13.990" style="s2">interaction so you see this in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.300" end="01:12:16.430" style="s2">campuses for example where increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.990" end="01:12:18.680" style="s2">particularly heterosexual contact is</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.430" end="01:12:21.230" style="s2">regulated by a doctrine that says you</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.680" end="01:12:25.910" style="s2">have to get spoken permission for every</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.230" end="01:12:29.480" style="s2">move in the mating process and so you</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.910" end="01:12:31.280" style="s2">see and I know I&#39;m not expressing myself</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.480" end="01:12:32.510" style="s2">very well but there seems to be in our</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.280" end="01:12:35.810" style="s2">current culture there seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.510" end="01:12:37.880" style="s2">massive sexual confusion it&#39;s it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.810" end="01:12:45.860" style="s2">weird combination of extreme libertinism</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.880" end="01:12:50.020" style="s2">and extreme authoritarianism part of</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.860" end="01:12:53.440" style="s2">what&#39;s happening happening and is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.020" end="01:12:55.550" style="s2">sex impulse of sexual gratification</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.440" end="01:12:56.720" style="s2">trumps everything it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.550" end="01:12:58.370" style="s2">that I mean I know there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.720" end="01:13:03.110" style="s2">what&#39;s going on inside of the knob but</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.370" end="01:13:04.430" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly that and so well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.110" end="01:13:07.190" style="s2">trying to figure out what to say about</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.430" end="01:13:08.960" style="s2">that tonight because well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.190" end="01:13:13.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a lesson in there the lesson is</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.960" end="01:13:15.020" style="s2">something like don&#39;t let sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.100" end="01:13:16.700" style="s2">don&#39;t let impulse and sexuality get the</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.020" end="01:13:18.590" style="s2">upper hand it&#39;s something like that or</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.700" end="01:13:21.350" style="s2">all hell will break loose which I</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.590" end="01:13:22.580" style="s2">actually happen to agree with so one of</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.350" end="01:13:24.350" style="s2">the things that we haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.580" end="01:13:27.470" style="s2">talk about in our culture I think is</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.350" end="01:13:31.490" style="s2">let&#39;s take the idea the phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.470" end="01:13:34.250" style="s2">AIDS like AIDS mutated to take advantage</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.490" end="01:13:36.470" style="s2">of promiscuous sexuality and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.250" end="01:13:39.110" style="s2">nothing you never hear that publicized</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.470" end="01:13:41.210" style="s2">you know people had associated AIDS with</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.110" end="01:13:42.530" style="s2">homosexuality and there was a reason for</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.210" end="01:13:43.910" style="s2">that because it&#39;s much more easily</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.530" end="01:13:46.930" style="s2">transmitted as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.910" end="01:13:49.570" style="s2">homosexual sex than heterosexual sex</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.930" end="01:13:51.500" style="s2">because the anus is a much more delicate</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.570" end="01:13:53.480" style="s2">physiological structure it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.500" end="01:13:56.810" style="s2">robust and it can be eat much more</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.480" end="01:13:59.030" style="s2">easily damaged and and and with with</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.810" end="01:14:01.430" style="s2">disease resulting as a consequence but</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.030" end="01:14:03.440" style="s2">it isn&#39;t only the matter of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.430" end="01:14:06.410" style="s2">action that&#39;s the issue it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.440" end="01:14:08.510" style="s2">fact that promiscuity provided the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.410" end="01:14:10.730" style="s2">evolutionary platform for the AIDS virus</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.510" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">to mutate into a very into the form that</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.730" end="01:14:14.600" style="s2">it finally took and it was only through</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:18.530" style="s2">the skin by the skin of our teeth that</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.600" end="01:14:21.400" style="s2">we escaped a total izing plague you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.530" end="01:14:24.619" style="s2">had that emerged 100 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.400" end="01:14:28.940" style="s2">god only knows how many people would</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.619" end="01:14:31.969" style="s2">have died AIDS was unbelievably fatal so</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.940" end="01:14:34.280" style="s2">I know that&#39;s a mishmash of ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.969" end="01:14:36.260" style="s2">I&#39;m not exactly sure how to see my way</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.280" end="01:14:38.780" style="s2">clear through it but there is a clear</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.260" end="01:14:42.020" style="s2">warning in that story about about</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.780" end="01:14:46.520" style="s2">something about to do with with with</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.020" end="01:14:50.570" style="s2">sexual iniquity in in the Bible that</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.520" end="01:14:55.119" style="s2">sexuality has two two poles that define</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.570" end="01:14:58.580" style="s2">it and it&#39;s pretty clear one one side is</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.119" end="01:15:02.719" style="s2">reproduction and the other side is we</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.580" end="01:15:04.639" style="s2">could let&#39;s say recreation okay so so</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.719" end="01:15:07.429" style="s2">those are the two folds of sexuality in</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.639" end="01:15:09.650" style="s2">a normal world so it&#39;s not just for</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.429" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">reproduction and it&#39;s not just for</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.650" end="01:15:15.800" style="s2">recreation it&#39;s both like that was the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:18.650" style="s2">idea I mean I mean actual idea now if</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.800" end="01:15:20.750" style="s2">you if there&#39;s a balance there and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.650" end="01:15:23.650" style="s2">know that should be have if you lose</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.750" end="01:15:26.060" style="s2">this balance and it becomes just about</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.650" end="01:15:28.070" style="s2">reproduction that&#39;s a problem if it</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.060" end="01:15:30.830" style="s2">becomes just about recreation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.070" end="01:15:32.690" style="s2">another problem you know okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.830" end="01:15:34.070" style="s2">that complicated really but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.690" end="01:15:36.860" style="s2">politically incorrect to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.070" end="01:15:38.630" style="s2">these things a little bit obvious well</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.860" end="01:15:40.909" style="s2">that nobody cares you talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.630" end="01:15:42.679" style="s2">the thing is is that the most difficult</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.909" end="01:15:44.989" style="s2">things to talk about are the things that</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.679" end="01:15:46.820" style="s2">are obvious because when they&#39;re obvious</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.989" end="01:15:48.380" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to talk about them and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.820" end="01:15:51.650" style="s2">then when people start to question the</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.380" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">obvious you don&#39;t know what to say yes I</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.650" end="01:15:56.480" style="s2">guess so for example we would I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.800" end="01:15:59.389" style="s2">thinking about the [ __ ] walks you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.480" end="01:16:01.310" style="s2">and so women go out and they dress very</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.389" end="01:16:03.110" style="s2">provocatively and and they go out and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.310" end="01:16:05.360" style="s2">manifest their right to be as</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.110" end="01:16:08.750" style="s2">provocative as they possibly can be</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.360" end="01:16:10.580" style="s2">without being interfered with and I have</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.750" end="01:16:13.429" style="s2">some sympathy for that perspective</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.580" end="01:16:15.830" style="s2">because it seems to me appropriate for</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.429" end="01:16:18.369" style="s2">women to be the final arbiters in sexual</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.830" end="01:16:21.920" style="s2">contact but on the other hand it also</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.369" end="01:16:23.810" style="s2">it&#39;s that whole exercise is blind to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.920" end="01:16:28.610" style="s2">fact that clothing for example has</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.810" end="01:16:31.219" style="s2">communicative intent and that people</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.610" end="01:16:33.469" style="s2">broadcast their invitation to sexual</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.219" end="01:16:34.580" style="s2">congress in a million ways subtle and</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.469" end="01:16:37.460" style="s2">not-so-subtle</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.580" end="01:16:40.340" style="s2">and you can&#39;t just say I have the right</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.460" end="01:16:46.340" style="s2">to broadcast myself in any manner</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.340" end="01:16:47.930" style="s2">possible and be completely beat what</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.340" end="01:16:49.820" style="s2">completely immune from the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.930" end="01:16:52.220" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with that and</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.820" end="01:16:55.340" style="s2">with regards to basic sexual morality</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.220" end="01:16:58.520" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve read things about like</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.340" end="01:17:00.820" style="s2">slut-shaming is that the more radical</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.520" end="01:17:03.170" style="s2">feminist types for example claim that</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.820" end="01:17:04.760" style="s2">women shouldn&#39;t be held responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.170" end="01:17:06.140" style="s2">their sexual behavior in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.760" end="01:17:08.450" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be held against them how many</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.140" end="01:17:11.270" style="s2">men they&#39;ve slept with etc but then I</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.450" end="01:17:13.460" style="s2">think well you never recommend to</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.270" end="01:17:15.320" style="s2">someone that they lay down naked on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.460" end="01:17:17.270" style="s2">on the side of the street with their</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.320" end="01:17:20.630" style="s2">legs spread and invite anybody who walks</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.270" end="01:17:22.930" style="s2">by to partake of the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.630" end="01:17:25.220" style="s2">everyone would regard that as</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.930" end="01:17:29.150" style="s2">inappropriate I think without question</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.220" end="01:17:32.300" style="s2">and so what that indicates is that some</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.150" end="01:17:34.790" style="s2">degree of sexual propriety is both</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.300" end="01:17:37.700" style="s2">normative and ethical and then of course</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.790" end="01:17:39.980" style="s2">you can start asking yourself about what</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.700" end="01:17:42.290" style="s2">that degree of social sexual propriety</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.980" end="01:17:43.400" style="s2">should be and it does have something to</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.290" end="01:17:49.550" style="s2">do with getting the balance between</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.400" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">reproduction and recreation right okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.550" end="01:17:56.240" style="s2">but the thing even in the Bible there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.960" end="01:17:58.940" style="s2">there&#39;s the two aspects some stories are</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.240" end="01:18:01.070" style="s2">about just this aspect and there are the</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.940" end="01:18:06.380" style="s2">most strange stories in the Bible for</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.070" end="01:18:08.900" style="s2">example the story of Tamar is one of</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.380" end="01:18:12.050" style="s2">those so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.900" end="01:18:15.230" style="s2">with that story but stuff it&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.050" end="01:18:19.730" style="s2">it&#39;s intercut with the story of Joseph</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.230" end="01:18:24.470" style="s2">okay in Egypt and it&#39;s essentially it</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.730" end="01:18:27.020" style="s2">says that Judah has children with some</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.470" end="01:18:29.000" style="s2">woman and I think it&#39;s a stranger it</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.020" end="01:18:29.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily say so but it seems</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.000" end="01:18:34.370" style="s2">like that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.900" end="01:18:36.770" style="s2">and then the sons die off and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.370" end="01:18:39.560" style="s2">there&#39;s this woman called Tamar and she</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.770" end="01:18:45.830" style="s2">disguises herself as a prostitute great</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.560" end="01:18:48.360" style="s2">and she has a kid with Judah himself so</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.830" end="01:18:51.540" style="s2">all the simple jurors heard that shorty</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.360" end="01:18:54.780" style="s2">elements of his clothing yes demonstrate</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.540" end="01:18:56.429" style="s2">as a as a bribe yes essentially she</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.780" end="01:18:58.500" style="s2">wants to indicate later that he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.429" end="01:19:02.429" style="s2">one who slept with her yeah yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.500" end="01:19:06.150" style="s2">that story is about then is that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.429" end="01:19:08.520" style="s2">need for the recreated part of sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.150" end="01:19:10.949" style="s2">it&#39;s all about that symbolism it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.520" end="01:19:16.530" style="s2">about the seat it&#39;s all about incest</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.949" end="01:19:19.469" style="s2">it&#39;s all about that and the idea is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.530" end="01:19:21.480" style="s2">to raise the dead okay it&#39;s not clear in</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.469" end="01:19:22.920" style="s2">the story but if you understand the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.480" end="01:19:27.719" style="s2">imagery that&#39;s what it&#39;s about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.920" end="01:19:30.989" style="s2">about regressing back to an error that</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.719" end="01:19:32.940" style="s2">was made okay and raising the dead so I</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.989" end="01:19:34.679" style="s2">want to get into it but just the idea</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.940" end="01:19:37.940" style="s2">that in the Bible there&#39;s folks</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.679" end="01:19:42.420" style="s2">- there&#39;s reproduction and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.940" end="01:19:44.489" style="s2">recreation and the recreation is renewal</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.420" end="01:19:47.130" style="s2">there&#39;s the original sexuality is about</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.489" end="01:19:50.699" style="s2">renewal - but that aspect of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.130" end="01:19:52.170" style="s2">symbolism is is pretty I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.699" end="01:19:55.050" style="s2">say obscure because it&#39;s actually right</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.170" end="01:19:56.550" style="s2">there if you can see it but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.050" end="01:19:59.429" style="s2">strange I&#39;ll say it like that</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.550" end="01:20:01.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange okay okay so now another</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.429" end="01:20:04.679" style="s2">element of this might be the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.530" end="01:20:07.380" style="s2">in modern identity politics sexual</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.679" end="01:20:09.449" style="s2">choice is a canonical identifier and</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.380" end="01:20:12.090" style="s2">that also seems to me to be something</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.449" end="01:20:14.070" style="s2">wrong about that like one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.090" end="01:20:16.969" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen happening in Toronto I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.070" end="01:20:19.530" style="s2">it&#39;s the same in Montreal is that and</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.969" end="01:20:21.570" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do this awkwardly I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.530" end="01:20:24.260" style="s2">to put this awkwardly because I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.570" end="01:20:28.230" style="s2">been able to sort through it properly</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.260" end="01:20:29.790" style="s2">Pride Week Pride Day has turned into</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.230" end="01:20:32.850" style="s2">Pride Week and that&#39;s turned into Pride</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.790" end="01:20:34.500" style="s2">Month and I think that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.850" end="01:20:37.619" style="s2">pushing against some kind of limit</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.500" end="01:20:39.449" style="s2">because the first question that I have</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.619" end="01:20:41.460" style="s2">is like I was reading this book the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.449" end="01:20:44.400" style="s2">other day by a friend of mine from</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.460" end="01:20:46.380" style="s2">Ottawa who&#39;s a gay conservative and he</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:48.330" style="s2">said he had a lot harder time coming out</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.380" end="01:20:52.679" style="s2">as a conservative than he had as coming</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.330" end="01:20:54.440" style="s2">out as gay and he talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.679" end="01:20:57.989" style="s2">degree to which homosexuals were</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.440" end="01:21:02.080" style="s2">persecuted in Canada before say the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.989" end="01:21:07.260" style="s2">1980s and it&#39;s quite it makes quite</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.080" end="01:21:07.260" style="s2">parce reading let&#39;s say and so-and-so</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.700" end="01:21:15.730" style="s2">fair enough to the to the civil rights</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.510" end="01:21:18.790" style="s2">movement let&#39;s say it that has brought</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.730" end="01:21:20.260" style="s2">homosexuality into the norm or that into</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.790" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">the mainstream maybe that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.260" end="01:21:24.610" style="s2">thinking about it but that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.320" end="01:21:27.100" style="s2">still has a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.610" end="01:21:33.010" style="s2">development that&#39;s necessary because I</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.100" end="01:21:34.720" style="s2">don&#39;t understand exactly it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.010" end="01:21:37.420" style="s2">obvious to me what integration into the</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.720" end="01:21:40.950" style="s2">mainstream precisely means because a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.420" end="01:21:44.320" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of talk so far about</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.950" end="01:21:45.640" style="s2">respecting the rights of gay people but</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.320" end="01:21:47.400" style="s2">very little talk about what the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.640" end="01:21:49.330" style="s2">accompanying responsibilities might be</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.400" end="01:21:52.330" style="s2">that actually seems to me to be a</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.330" end="01:21:56.350" style="s2">problem and I mean I just had a letter</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.330" end="01:21:58.990" style="s2">from from gay guy who is being wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.350" end="01:22:01.480" style="s2">with this because he&#39;s not sure how to</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.990" end="01:22:03.190" style="s2">be gay and to be ethical at the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.480" end="01:22:05.530" style="s2">time you know because he sees part of</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.190" end="01:22:07.420" style="s2">normative behavior as taking wife and</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.530" end="01:22:08.800" style="s2">having children and not and can see the</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.420" end="01:22:11.800" style="s2">value in that but that&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.800" end="01:22:13.750" style="s2">the direction of his proclivity and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.800" end="01:22:17.380" style="s2">we wrote wrote to me asking me what he</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.750" end="01:22:18.790" style="s2">should do and you know I don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.380" end="01:22:21.910" style="s2">answer for that I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.790" end="01:22:23.020" style="s2">answer to that is but I know that it</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.910" end="01:22:25.860" style="s2">might be something that would be worth</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.020" end="01:22:28.660" style="s2">talking about and then it&#39;s part of this</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.860" end="01:22:32.620" style="s2">current confusion about sexual identity</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.660" end="01:22:37.240" style="s2">and sexual pleasure and and well even</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.620" end="01:22:39.160" style="s2">gender identity for that matter so all</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.240" end="01:22:42.220" style="s2">right so your idea was well the balance</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.160" end="01:22:45.910" style="s2">between recreation and reproduction had</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.220" end="01:22:47.830" style="s2">gone was completely absent in Sodom it</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.910" end="01:22:50.470" style="s2">was all recreation it was all instant</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.830" end="01:22:53.830" style="s2">gratification and impulse yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.470" end="01:22:57.130" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s put in contests with the</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.830" end="01:22:58.870" style="s2">Abraham bit because it&#39;s the same Angels</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.130" end="01:22:59.290" style="s2">know in that case he says you&#39;ll have a</p>
