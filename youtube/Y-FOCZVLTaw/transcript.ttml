<p begin="00:00:41.130" end="00:00:46.170" style="s2">about linguistics and Creole languages</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">it is an absolutely fascinating topic at</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.170" end="00:00:52.170" style="s2">the moment though I think what is taking</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">place in the Republic is of great</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.170" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">importance and I know you feel the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:59.700" style="s2">way and so we are going to focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">today if that&#39;s all right by you that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.700" end="00:01:07.549" style="s2">works for me all right great so let me</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:10.889" style="s2">lay this out a little bit for you I am I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.549" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">am feeling a bit called at the moment by</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.889" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">what is taking place and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">urgency of it is is quite great are you</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:23.299" style="s2">also feeling called is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:26.509" style="s2">assessment yeah I certainly am being</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.299" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">called in terms of suddenly the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.509" end="00:01:32.039" style="s2">number of emails and tweets and various</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">kinds of Facebook messages I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.039" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">but yeah a moment has come when</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">something that&#39;s been kind of burbling</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:42.209" style="s2">since the year 2013 is about when there</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:45.569" style="s2">was a real sea change has really come to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.209" end="00:01:47.069" style="s2">a head and left a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.569" end="00:01:50.039" style="s2">would consider themselves liberal or</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.069" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">even leftists curious as to what this</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.039" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">new extreme prosecutorial strain of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:02:01.069" style="s2">left is that now actually seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">making its way into mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.069" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">institutions and so I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">many of us whose work and thoughts have</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">been relevant to that over the past six</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.439" style="s2">or seven years where suddenly over the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">past three weeks it seems like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.439" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">time when we&#39;re needed or that we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">to say something it&#39;s felt almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:21.750" style="s2">burden to me because things are having</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:24.300" style="s2">so quickly that it&#39;s hard to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.750" end="00:02:26.670" style="s2">large picture idea that you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">standing the test of time but I have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.670" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">get over the idea that everything you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:33.090" style="s2">say is gonna stand the test of time or</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">you know sound like Will Durant but yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.090" end="00:02:38.880" style="s2">this is this is a tough time it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:41.700" style="s2">tough time and I know that there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.880" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">just the fact that we&#39;re walking a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.700" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">Razors Edge of sorts and one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:48.270" style="s2">want to say something that one discovers</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:51.300" style="s2">is taken the wrong way and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">things worse so that&#39;s a problem I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.300" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">probably we&#39;re both facing in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:03:00.209" style="s2">circumstance but in any case I think you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:02.730" style="s2">and I have never met in person but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.209" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">think we have established a rapport</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.730" end="00:03:07.410" style="s2">online in the way that happens it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">very odd process but I think we trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.410" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">each other and what I would suggest is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:18.150" style="s2">for this conversation to be maximally</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:20.670" style="s2">useful that we suspend all rules of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:23.459" style="s2">politeness in other words I would like</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.670" end="00:03:28.230" style="s2">you to be absolutely as direct with me</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.459" end="00:03:31.380" style="s2">as you think is helpful and I promise</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.230" end="00:03:34.070" style="s2">you I will not be thin-skinned even if</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.380" end="00:03:36.920" style="s2">the corrections of my perspective are</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.070" end="00:03:39.480" style="s2">substantial and I will do the same and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.920" end="00:03:42.590" style="s2">in so doing we can model how a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.480" end="00:03:44.579" style="s2">conversation about race which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.590" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2">unavoidably going to be at the center of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.579" end="00:03:51.269" style="s2">what we talk about might sound and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.180" end="00:03:53.390" style="s2">people can get a sense of an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.269" end="00:03:56.970" style="s2">to the dialogue that we see unfolding on</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.390" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">on the streets of the u.s. at this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.970" end="00:04:01.769" style="s2">moment okay that makes sense I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">say beforehand though and this is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.769" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">seem trivial that for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">are watching this as well as listening</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:10.709" style="s2">my appearance is probably quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">unpleasant and it&#39;s because I am in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.709" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">rustic cabin not by myself and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:18.359" style="s2">filling envelopes with anything but I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:20.010" style="s2">up far away not in the view of too many</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.359" end="00:04:21.479" style="s2">human beings other than my children I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.010" end="00:04:23.550" style="s2">have Kovan hair</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.479" end="00:04:26.039" style="s2">I have not styled it today I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.550" end="00:04:27.630" style="s2">shaven I&#39;m wearing the wrong glasses so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.039" end="00:04:30.120" style="s2">letting you know I know what this looks</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.630" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">like this is not how I look but in any</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.120" end="00:04:35.430" style="s2">case let us proceed to weightier matters</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">well you know what you look great but</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.430" end="00:04:39.810" style="s2">you&#39;ve also landed in the right place</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:41.789" style="s2">because my audience is thoroughly used</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.810" end="00:04:43.740" style="s2">to Cova dare I have had kovat hair from</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.789" end="00:04:46.770" style="s2">the start before anyone had heard of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.740" end="00:04:49.259" style="s2">kovat night sense though anyway by</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.770" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">comparison and in absolute terms here</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.259" end="00:04:56.009" style="s2">you&#39;re just fine so okay what is going</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:59.639" style="s2">on in the Republic I have the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.009" end="00:05:02.759" style="s2">a story I lived in 2017 at a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.639" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">college in the northwest corner of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.759" end="00:05:07.699" style="s2">country has suddenly spilled over and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s now in every major city in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.699" end="00:05:14.070" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s funny the what happened to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">you outside of your office what we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.070" end="00:05:19.650" style="s2">now see on video it&#39;s been fashionable</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">to say that that frame of mind was just</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.650" end="00:05:24.539" style="s2">a bunch of crazy kids among people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:27.509" style="s2">some people I think really do think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.539" end="00:05:30.810" style="s2">and other people haven&#39;t wanted to allow</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.509" end="00:05:32.789" style="s2">that that kind of view is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.810" end="00:05:35.430" style="s2">dominant probably because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.789" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">people who are inclined to dismiss that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.430" end="00:05:40.050" style="s2">as a lot of crazy kids are people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:42.330" style="s2">are inclined to let it pass in general</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.050" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">and often aren&#39;t aware that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.330" end="00:05:46.740" style="s2">part of those people and then themselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:49.650" style="s2">but the question is why has it become</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.740" end="00:05:52.250" style="s2">what I almost can&#39;t let come out of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.650" end="00:05:54.870" style="s2">mouth it&#39;s becoming a mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.250" end="00:05:57.389" style="s2">sentiment this unreasoning form of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.870" end="00:05:59.310" style="s2">leftism where language is misused in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.389" end="00:06:00.509" style="s2">ways that seem so Stalinist and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.310" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">Orwellian that it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.509" end="00:06:04.680" style="s2">cartoon and yet the people are standing</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">there actually taking themselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.680" end="00:06:09.810" style="s2">seriously and having no idea that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.990" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is recapitulating some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.810" end="00:06:14.759" style="s2">the most futile and useless</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:16.500" style="s2">socio-political currents in history it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.759" end="00:06:19.349" style="s2">really an interesting cocktail because</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:21.139" style="s2">you even wonder George Floyd what</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.349" end="00:06:23.969" style="s2">happened to him was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.139" end="00:06:26.099" style="s2">unjustifiable and yet the fact is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.969" end="00:06:28.740" style="s2">similarly absolutely unjustifiable</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.099" end="00:06:31.590" style="s2">things happen to black men and I should</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.740" end="00:06:33.780" style="s2">say men in general not to mention women</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.590" end="00:06:37.380" style="s2">in the United States practically every</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.780" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2">day why that particular person why did</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.380" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">that bring this out to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.150" end="00:06:44.849" style="s2">it did and we&#39;ve seen this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:45.569" style="s2">ideology brought out by cop killings</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.849" end="00:06:47.669" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.569" end="00:06:49.949" style="s2">an iconic time was with Trayvon Martin</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.669" end="00:06:52.469" style="s2">when social media as we know it was</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.889" end="00:07:17.879" style="s2">I think and this is not to minimize how</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:20.099" style="s2">important it is that we reform the cops</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.879" end="00:07:22.199" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely important but I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.099" end="00:07:25.080" style="s2">that the virus had something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.199" end="00:07:28.050" style="s2">the heat of the response here I think a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.080" end="00:07:30.770" style="s2">lot of people were really tired of being</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.050" end="00:07:33.209" style="s2">trapped inside were really tired of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.770" end="00:07:35.550" style="s2">muzzled feeling that we&#39;ve all had since</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.209" end="00:07:37.619" style="s2">the middle of March and the weather</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.550" end="00:07:40.019" style="s2">starts to get better and that man was</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.019" end="00:07:44.029" style="s2">time and I think a lot of people and</p>

<p begin="00:07:44.029" end="00:07:49.169" style="s2">rioters I mean everybody you see in</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.379" end="00:07:51.119" style="s2">these protests wanted a reason to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.169" end="00:07:52.499" style="s2">outside I don&#39;t think it was deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.119" end="00:07:54.539" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they were being cynical</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.499" end="00:07:56.399" style="s2">but I think there was a joy in being</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.399" end="00:08:01.559" style="s2">some passion and to get outside and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.769" end="00:08:04.379" style="s2">to tell you the truth if that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.559" end="00:08:06.959" style="s2">cop reform I say fine that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.379" end="00:08:08.699" style="s2">history works but nevertheless it did</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.959" end="00:08:11.159" style="s2">bring out this particular kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.699" end="00:08:13.469" style="s2">with a particular kind of message and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.159" end="00:08:16.139" style="s2">now have a particular kind of social</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.139" end="00:08:22.469" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t help either we have a truly</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.469" end="00:08:28.079" style="s2">a lot of people very very upset and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:31.019" style="s2">justifiably and so after 19th in 1960</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.079" end="00:08:33.240" style="s2">after 2016 I imagine we were primed for</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.019" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">something like this anyway so I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.240" end="00:08:40.979" style="s2">that that&#39;s why all of a sudden this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:43.769" style="s2">hard unreasoning Orwellian social</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.170" end="00:09:09.250" style="s2">to this kind of rhetoric because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:13.480" style="s2">frightening and yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.250" end="00:09:17.020" style="s2">take in well we have our work cut out</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.480" end="00:09:19.810" style="s2">for us I see a lot in what you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.020" end="00:09:22.090" style="s2">that I agree with but I think I&#39;m far</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.810" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">more worried than it sounds like you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.090" end="00:09:26.590" style="s2">about what&#39;s going to come out of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:28.690" style="s2">for a couple reasons</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.590" end="00:09:29.890" style="s2">and I should say one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.690" end="00:09:31.210" style="s2">think I&#39;ve never spoken about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.890" end="00:09:34.060" style="s2">publicly but one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.210" end="00:09:36.070" style="s2">happened is evergreen came apart was it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.060" end="00:09:38.980" style="s2">was graffiti about me all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.070" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">and posters and there was a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.980" end="00:09:44.050" style="s2">amount of trayvon martin stuff hurled at</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:45.940" style="s2">me as if i was george zimmerman or</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.050" end="00:09:48.610" style="s2">something like that and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.940" end="00:09:52.840" style="s2">reason that this matters is that it just</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.610" end="00:09:57.610" style="s2">tells you how preposterous the claims</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.840" end="00:10:00.340" style="s2">can be and still pass muster in in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.610" end="00:10:03.610" style="s2">movement and so you say people know</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.340" end="00:10:06.490" style="s2">they&#39;re being bullshitted a few do and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.610" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">think they start out knowing that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.490" end="00:10:11.940" style="s2">that there&#39;s an insidious process here</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:15.340" style="s2">in which people feel jeopardized</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.940" end="00:10:17.950" style="s2">understandably they make concessions</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.340" end="00:10:20.790" style="s2">that are initially small and then they</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.950" end="00:10:24.010" style="s2">are marched in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.790" end="00:10:25.840" style="s2">gargantuan falsehoods that they then</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.010" end="00:10:28.570" style="s2">have to convince themselves of in order</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.840" end="00:10:31.030" style="s2">to sleep at night and so it it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.570" end="00:10:33.070" style="s2">of spreading process the reason that so</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.030" end="00:10:34.660" style="s2">many people got wrong what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.070" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">on college campuses was that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:39.070" style="s2">thought it was a college phenomenon they</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:41.830" style="s2">thought kids protest and part of growing</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.070" end="00:10:43.750" style="s2">up and that&#39;s never what this was that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.830" end="00:10:48.100" style="s2">an element of it it&#39;s why we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.750" end="00:10:51.550" style="s2">there first but this is I think a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.100" end="00:10:54.610" style="s2">contagious madness and the worst part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.550" end="00:10:58.210" style="s2">this contagious madness is that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.610" end="00:11:00.130" style="s2">it is focused on a false narrative and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.210" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">really believe the narrative is false it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.130" end="00:11:05.710" style="s2">is obscuring the true narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:10.210" style="s2">actually explains the frustration and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.710" end="00:11:12.340" style="s2">in what says well let&#39;s start this way I</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.210" end="00:11:14.529" style="s2">believe that what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.340" end="00:11:16.930" style="s2">is a couple things you&#39;re right about</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.529" end="00:11:20.140" style="s2">kovat 19 there&#39;s an element I would add</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.930" end="00:11:22.420" style="s2">which is that kovat 19 pulled the rug</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.140" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">out from under the economy as far as</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.420" end="00:11:27.700" style="s2">working people go and so the you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">the sort of Occupy sentiment that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.700" end="00:11:33.310" style="s2">system is rigged and that that haunts</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:36.100" style="s2">some of us more than others is now this</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.310" end="00:11:38.710" style="s2">is an Occupy 2.0 phenomenon that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.100" end="00:11:41.650" style="s2">seeing with a black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.710" end="00:11:43.750" style="s2">phenomenon right so people who&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.650" end="00:11:45.880" style="s2">their jobs discovered that their jobs</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.750" end="00:11:49.210" style="s2">were garbage to begin with you know in</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.880" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">the Cova 19 situation are looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.210" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">forward and realizing that they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2">their slice of the pie isn&#39;t very large</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:59.260" style="s2">and they&#39;re spilling into the streets so</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.920" end="00:12:01.540" style="s2">the frustration I think is quite real</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.260" end="00:12:04.380" style="s2">and understandable yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.540" end="00:12:07.960" style="s2">understandable but I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.380" end="00:12:10.120" style="s2">policing and in particular brutal</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.960" end="00:12:12.580" style="s2">policing and militarized policing are a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.120" end="00:12:16.540" style="s2">symptom of an economic system that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.580" end="00:12:19.180" style="s2">actually rigged in ways that are obvious</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.540" end="00:12:21.700" style="s2">sometimes and in ways that are subtle in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.180" end="00:12:23.920" style="s2">others in other places but that in</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.700" end="00:12:25.750" style="s2">effect we are now having a battle about</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.920" end="00:12:28.300" style="s2">policing that makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.750" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">yes policing needs to be reformed this</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.300" end="00:12:33.400" style="s2">is clear but you can&#39;t certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:36.130" style="s2">discussion in which police reform is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.400" end="00:12:39.280" style="s2">being blurred with the concept of you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.130" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">know eliminating the police there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.280" end="00:12:44.500" style="s2">conversation to be had even if there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:46.060" style="s2">some way to eliminate the police you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.500" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">certainly can&#39;t start there</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.060" end="00:12:52.750" style="s2">so we&#39;re having a frustratingly empty</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">conversation and this is causing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.750" end="00:12:58.930" style="s2">people who are maybe not as aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">unfairness in our system and the rigna</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.930" end="00:13:03.280" style="s2">of our system it&#39;s causing them to feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:05.380" style="s2">emboldened because they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.280" end="00:13:07.750" style="s2">arguments that don&#39;t add up and their</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.380" end="00:13:09.130" style="s2">sense as well as to shut this down right</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.750" end="00:13:13.720" style="s2">so they&#39;re missing the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.130" end="00:13:16.450" style="s2">energy behind the protest is the result</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.720" end="00:13:19.089" style="s2">of something a very natural process and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.450" end="00:13:20.950" style="s2">a real something yeah a very real</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.089" end="00:13:26.410" style="s2">something people have a right to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.950" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">frustrated now let&#39;s just March right</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.410" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">the fire was George Floyd murdered yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.900" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">what Derek Chauvin did to him was</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.250" end="00:13:48.700" style="s2">utterly unnecessary I mean George Floyd</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">was very intoxicated he was acting up I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.700" end="00:13:52.030" style="s2">find it very difficult to see from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:54.520" style="s2">videos whether or not he was resisting</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.030" end="00:13:58.600" style="s2">arrest if anything he seems to have been</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.800" end="00:15:04.390" style="s2">here that people are justifiably upset</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.630" end="00:15:06.790" style="s2">about too many black people are poor but</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.390" end="00:15:10.090" style="s2">as it turns out it&#39;s almost in the</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.010" end="00:15:29.770" style="s2">what that means is that one may despise</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.410" end="00:15:32.020" style="s2">the cops but to say that George Floyd</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.770" end="00:15:34.180" style="s2">was murdered because he was black as</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.020" end="00:15:36.070" style="s2">tempting as it is to think that given</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.180" end="00:15:38.770" style="s2">that that&#39;s the film that we&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.430" end="00:15:44.170" style="s2">but it&#39;s not an accurate depiction of</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.220" end="00:15:52.750" style="s2">Washington Post has done a project that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.260" end="00:15:54.370" style="s2">tells you exactly who&#39;s been killed year</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.770" end="00:16:06.850" style="s2">error so yes I would say that George</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.200" end="00:16:09.279" style="s2">Floyd was murdered but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.850" end="00:16:12.310" style="s2">that to say that it was because of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.279" end="00:16:13.990" style="s2">black skin did tracks from solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.310" end="00:16:16.120" style="s2">America&#39;s problems that would float all</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.120" end="00:16:21.180" style="s2">of stain and what worries me about all</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.550" end="00:16:23.649" style="s2">of this is that as I&#39;ve written often</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.180" end="00:16:25.390" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing not with the political</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.649" end="00:16:27.430" style="s2">ideology but with something that an</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.390" end="00:16:29.589" style="s2">anthropologist would recognize as</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.430" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">religion and it&#39;s easy to hear me say</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.589" end="00:16:32.260" style="s2">that and think that I&#39;m trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:34.510" style="s2">rhetorical point I don&#39;t mean like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.260" end="00:16:36.459" style="s2">religion it is a religion the way that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.510" end="00:16:40.270" style="s2">you understand how these people operate</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.459" end="00:16:42.760" style="s2">is to actually imagine how you would</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.270" end="00:16:44.500" style="s2">interact with a Mormon who you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.760" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">trying to convince that Joseph Smith</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.500" end="00:16:49.450" style="s2">didn&#39;t dig up tablets in the backyard</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">and again not rhetoric folks exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.450" end="00:16:53.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s the same frame of much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:56.410" style="s2">just that our language doesn&#39;t happen to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.200" end="00:16:58.390" style="s2">apply the label religion to the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.410" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">ideology that we&#39;ve seen over about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.390" end="00:17:03.760" style="s2">past ten years and so the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:05.800" style="s2">that the tenets of this religion that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.760" end="00:17:08.949" style="s2">dominates is that to be against racism</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.800" end="00:17:13.809" style="s2">trumped literally everything else there</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.949" end="00:17:15.850" style="s2">are ranked priorities and being against</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.809" end="00:17:18.809" style="s2">racism and we have to talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.850" end="00:17:22.209" style="s2">that is but being against racism is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.809" end="00:17:24.130" style="s2">everything to the point that you allow</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.209" end="00:17:26.829" style="s2">yourself not to make any logical sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.130" end="00:17:28.449" style="s2">and so you must be against racism and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.829" end="00:17:30.429" style="s2">the George Floyd must have been murdered</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.449" end="00:17:35.710" style="s2">because he was black and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.429" end="00:17:38.500" style="s2">questions asked and you cannot have any</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.710" end="00:17:41.290" style="s2">kind of dialogue with a person of color</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.500" end="00:17:42.550" style="s2">about racism if you have any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.290" end="00:17:44.290" style="s2">dialogue with them if you question</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.550" end="00:17:47.620" style="s2">anything that they say such as you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.290" end="00:17:50.050" style="s2">you are a racist and they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.620" end="00:17:53.140" style="s2">questions to be asked and I&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.050" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">even in my own academic work</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.140" end="00:17:57.429" style="s2">where you know as a much more naive</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.240" end="00:20:20.539" style="s2">first I look like that they&#39;ve built out</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.679" end="00:20:22.370" style="s2">of little eggs and they come again</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.539" end="00:20:24.409" style="s2">you&#39;re a racist and yes that&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.179" end="00:20:36.260" style="s2">and so they decide that they&#39;re agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.429" end="00:20:38.450" style="s2">about the matter they say I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.260" end="00:20:40.130" style="s2">care how Creole languages form as if</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.130" end="00:20:42.950" style="s2">you wish to know when you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.389" end="00:20:44.360" style="s2">languages where do they come from and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.950" end="00:20:46.070" style="s2">out were they born it&#39;s like a biologist</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.360" end="00:20:48.350" style="s2">saying oh I don&#39;t care about the DNA I</p>

<p begin="00:20:52.010" end="00:20:56.389" style="s2">passes for actual coherent thought in</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.289" end="00:20:57.710" style="s2">linguistics in my little area of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.389" end="00:21:00.200" style="s2">linguistics because you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.710" end="00:21:01.880" style="s2">say that black people ever didn&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.200" end="00:21:03.590" style="s2">a language well even if they were slaves</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.409" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re up against oh I see what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.639" end="00:21:11.330" style="s2">mean that it can take over everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:12.860" style="s2">but I always thought okay it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.330" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">college students it&#39;s also college</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.860" end="00:21:17.779" style="s2">professors it&#39;s certain college town</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">realms but it&#39;s not gonna take over the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.779" end="00:21:22.340" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:24.769" style="s2">maybe up in naive well I again agree</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.340" end="00:21:27.110" style="s2">with a ton of what you say this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.769" end="00:21:28.760" style="s2">religion we are seeing exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.110" end="00:21:32.179" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about in biology as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.760" end="00:21:34.429" style="s2">we&#39;re having a fight over whether sex is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.179" end="00:21:37.519" style="s2">real that is absurd because this</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.429" end="00:21:39.289" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly be clearer right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.519" end="00:21:41.090" style="s2">I know it&#39;s happening everywhere so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.289" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">tells you how insidious it is because</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.090" end="00:21:47.299" style="s2">almost everybody in my field knows</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:49.639" style="s2">better and yet most are quiet or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.299" end="00:21:52.190" style="s2">hedging because they don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.639" end="00:21:55.789" style="s2">Mol or the mob right so but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.190" end="00:21:59.350" style="s2">problem I have believed that George</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.789" end="00:22:02.090" style="s2">Floyd was murdered I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.350" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">necessarily what happened at this point</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.090" end="00:22:08.600" style="s2">and I think the problem is that that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:10.600" style="s2">taking on religious momentum and so if I</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:13.789" style="s2">can if you&#39;ll give me the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.600" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">scare you a little bit that&#39;s okay let</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.789" end="00:22:17.639" style="s2">me paint a different picture I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:20.070" style="s2">love to know yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.639" end="00:22:22.289" style="s2">what I saw on Vidya what I know that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.070" end="00:22:26.489" style="s2">saw is a miscarriage of justice a</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.289" end="00:22:29.999" style="s2">massive one what I don&#39;t know is enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.489" end="00:22:33.479" style="s2">about policing about drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.999" end="00:22:35.849" style="s2">physiology about heart attacks to know</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.479" end="00:22:37.469" style="s2">exactly what I saw I certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.849" end="00:22:40.079" style="s2">know that what I saw was racist for</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.469" end="00:22:42.479" style="s2">exactly the Tony timba point that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.079" end="00:22:44.219" style="s2">make that you know what we saw was that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.479" end="00:22:46.469" style="s2">the video was running on a case that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.219" end="00:22:49.139" style="s2">matches people&#39;s priors and so it got</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.469" end="00:22:51.809" style="s2">broadcast and caught on and that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.139" end="00:22:53.879" style="s2">about race but we don&#39;t know whether you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.809" end="00:22:56.070" style="s2">know let&#39;s say that Derek Chauvin did</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.879" end="00:22:57.419" style="s2">murder George Floyd we don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.070" end="00:23:00.679" style="s2">would have been equally likely had he</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.419" end="00:23:03.269" style="s2">been a white guy you can&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.679" end="00:23:07.079" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing that troubles me even</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.269" end="00:23:11.519" style="s2">more at this point is there is reason to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.079" end="00:23:13.289" style="s2">believe that that George Floyd saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.519" end="00:23:14.849" style="s2">that he could not breathe was occurring</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.289" end="00:23:15.899" style="s2">before he was ever on the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.849" end="00:23:18.299" style="s2">that he was having a heart attack</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.899" end="00:23:20.879" style="s2">there&#39;s some evidence to this effect we</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.299" end="00:23:23.579" style="s2">know from his autopsy that there were a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.879" end="00:23:23.999" style="s2">very potent combination of drugs in his</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.579" end="00:23:27.299" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.999" end="00:23:30.119" style="s2">Faton all I believe methamphetamine we</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.299" end="00:23:33.149" style="s2">know that the technique that Derek</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.119" end="00:23:35.339" style="s2">Chauvin was using is a technique that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.149" end="00:23:38.719" style="s2">officially sanctioned under some</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.339" end="00:23:41.639" style="s2">circumstances and I think we know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.719" end="00:23:45.089" style="s2">there was a discussion about whether or</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.639" end="00:23:47.579" style="s2">not George Floyd was in a state and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.089" end="00:23:52.529" style="s2">now forgotten I can almost remember the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.579" end="00:23:54.779" style="s2">acronym for the state II XD s maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.529" end="00:23:57.239" style="s2">required some kind of restraint to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.779" end="00:24:01.169" style="s2">prevent him from injuring himself or</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.239" end="00:24:04.679" style="s2">others so here&#39;s the question it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.169" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">possible that what happened there as</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.679" end="00:24:10.109" style="s2">egregious as it was fit with police</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:12.929" style="s2">policy that the police policy is what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.109" end="00:24:14.309" style="s2">in error and it is the police policy</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.929" end="00:24:17.459" style="s2">that caused the miscarriage of justice</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.309" end="00:24:21.539" style="s2">and while it&#39;s hard for me to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.459" end="00:24:24.570" style="s2">that Derek Chauvin is a good guy because</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.539" end="00:24:27.589" style="s2">he&#39;s obviously callous enough to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.570" end="00:24:29.639" style="s2">ignored this man&#39;s pleading and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.589" end="00:24:31.290" style="s2">insistence that he couldn&#39;t breathe to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.639" end="00:24:33.420" style="s2">the point so they had a record of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.290" end="00:24:35.070" style="s2">being a very callous policeman before</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.420" end="00:24:36.990" style="s2">but anyway right right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.070" end="00:24:42.150" style="s2">evidence of that so this about what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.990" end="00:24:46.290" style="s2">what I&#39;m really getting at is our system</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.150" end="00:24:48.540" style="s2">absolutely depends on the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.290" end="00:24:51.300" style="s2">do not convict people unless there has</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.540" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">been due process and yet we are now</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.300" end="00:24:55.680" style="s2">speaking about Derek Chauvin as if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:58.020" style="s2">all know that a murder took place and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.680" end="00:24:59.730" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly something you could see</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.020" end="00:25:01.890" style="s2">something on video that would tell you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.730" end="00:25:03.630" style="s2">almost beyond a reasonable doubt that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.890" end="00:25:05.880" style="s2">somebody had been murdered but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.630" end="00:25:07.380" style="s2">think what we saw on video tells us that</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.880" end="00:25:09.510" style="s2">because there&#39;s too much stuff that most</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.380" end="00:25:11.910" style="s2">of us don&#39;t know anything about like how</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.510" end="00:25:14.070" style="s2">do these drugs affect you what is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.910" end="00:25:17.220" style="s2">police policy in Minneapolis we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.070" end="00:25:21.690" style="s2">know any of those facts so so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.220" end="00:25:23.970" style="s2">here&#39;s my concern is it possible for</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.690" end="00:25:29.280" style="s2">Derek children to get a fair trial</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.970" end="00:25:32.010" style="s2">in in the modern era at this arm not in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.280" end="00:25:36.600" style="s2">the public sphere like I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.010" end="00:25:41.460" style="s2">quite possible and possibly to possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.600" end="00:25:43.470" style="s2">that he get off because of not only the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.460" end="00:25:45.870" style="s2">facts of the case but certain things</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.470" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2">entrenched in the cops and the unions</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.870" end="00:25:51.860" style="s2">and how trial works he could get off</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">because a very small number of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.860" end="00:25:56.040" style="s2">look at the sorts of things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:58.770" style="s2">looking at and realized that he does not</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.040" end="00:26:00.180" style="s2">deserve to be called a murderer</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.770" end="00:26:02.070" style="s2">if English had a more explicit</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.180" end="00:26:05.100" style="s2">subjunctive I&#39;d use it there that he did</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.070" end="00:26:07.110" style="s2">not deserve maybe he did but maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.100" end="00:26:09.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t I&#39;m not remotely offended at your</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.110" end="00:26:13.850" style="s2">saying that maybe he didn&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.740" end="00:26:17.460" style="s2">know like I&#39;ll even give you something</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.850" end="00:26:19.320" style="s2">watching the tape there are two things</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.460" end="00:26:21.480" style="s2">that strike me and one is that the Asian</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.320" end="00:26:23.010" style="s2">one whose name I forget is just sitting</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.480" end="00:26:25.020" style="s2">there watching and what we&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.010" end="00:26:27.450" style="s2">to think is that he&#39;s this barbarian but</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.020" end="00:26:29.250" style="s2">how many barbarians like that are there</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.450" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">who really would just stand there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.250" end="00:26:34.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve been told a part of it is that he</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:35.940" style="s2">actually is essentially a trainee at</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.140" end="00:26:38.010" style="s2">that point and he&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.940" end="00:26:41.340" style="s2">different but still if somebody is down</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.010" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">there expiring on the basis of a clearly</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.340" end="00:26:44.700" style="s2">murderous mood would he really be just</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:47.460" style="s2">standing there and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.700" end="00:26:49.710" style="s2">been giving an insouciant look into a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.460" end="00:26:51.990" style="s2">cellphone camera I&#39;ve wondered and also</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.710" end="00:26:53.850" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to say this and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.990" end="00:26:55.770" style="s2">never watched somebody die I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.850" end="00:26:57.540" style="s2">but it&#39;s my intuition and I&#39;ve had a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.770" end="00:26:59.660" style="s2">other people secretly write to me but</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.540" end="00:27:02.040" style="s2">they wonder he doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.660" end="00:27:02.610" style="s2">asphyxiated he keeps on saying I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.040" end="00:27:06.090" style="s2">breathe</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.610" end="00:27:08.370" style="s2">but it&#39;s so clear it&#39;s so loud he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.090" end="00:27:09.870" style="s2">saying oh man now I don&#39;t I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.370" end="00:27:12.390" style="s2">heard anybody it&#39;s fix e8 I may be</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.870" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">really missing something but you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.390" end="00:27:16.560" style="s2">some sort of constriction and from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.120" style="s2">sound the first time I heard this before</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.560" end="00:27:20.670" style="s2">I knew it was gonna be a big deal I</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.120" end="00:27:22.740" style="s2">thought it&#39;s terrible that he died but</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.670" end="00:27:25.260" style="s2">when he&#39;s saying I can&#39;t breathe I hate</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.740" end="00:27:28.410" style="s2">to admit it but it almost sounded like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.260" end="00:27:30.420" style="s2">quote it&#39;s almost like he was he</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.410" end="00:27:32.610" style="s2">remembered what Eric garner said and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.420" end="00:27:35.190" style="s2">not saying that he&#39;s he&#39;s trying to do a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.610" end="00:27:38.160" style="s2">show or that he was happy but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.190" end="00:27:40.230" style="s2">sound like he can&#39;t breathe now I say</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.160" end="00:27:41.640" style="s2">that out of naivete I have never had my</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.230" end="00:27:44.250" style="s2">knee on anybody&#39;s neck nobody&#39;s afraid</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.640" end="00:27:47.190" style="s2">of their knee on mine but I am open I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.250" end="00:27:49.920" style="s2">wondering whether the death was due not</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.190" end="00:27:51.450" style="s2">only to that pressure but to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.920" end="00:27:52.830" style="s2">that he had other things inside of him</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.450" end="00:27:55.260" style="s2">he couldn&#39;t have been a healthy man</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.830" end="00:27:56.820" style="s2">based on what we&#39;ve heard and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.260" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">deserve it but can you get a fair trial</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.820" end="00:28:01.590" style="s2">in society no and so for what we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:04.110" style="s2">based on the anti-racist imperative is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.590" end="00:28:06.930" style="s2">that he absolutely has to be guilty and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.110" end="00:28:09.450" style="s2">so for example Darren Walker and Mike</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.930" end="00:28:12.150" style="s2">Brown the facts make it clear including</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.450" end="00:28:14.070" style="s2">the black people who watch this who</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.150" end="00:28:16.110" style="s2">often recanted their original testimony</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.070" end="00:28:19.680" style="s2">which they made because they were afraid</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.110" end="00:28:21.780" style="s2">of being jumped by the narrative but he</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.680" end="00:28:23.790" style="s2">killed Mike Brown because Mike Brown</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.780" end="00:28:25.530" style="s2">kept coming at him and he was afraid he</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.790" end="00:28:27.510" style="s2">can have a whole discussion about why he</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.530" end="00:28:29.430" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have shot him in the knee etc</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.510" end="00:28:31.680" style="s2">you hear that the cops are trained to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.430" end="00:28:33.690" style="s2">shoot to kill after a certain point we</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.680" end="00:28:35.670" style="s2">don&#39;t the territory that again I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.690" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">really have my bearing in but he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.670" end="00:28:39.810" style="s2">just shoot the guy with his hands up it</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:42.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t true and yet you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.810" end="00:28:44.400" style="s2">The New Yorker does a profile of Darren</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.750" end="00:28:46.500" style="s2">Walker that makes him sound like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.400" end="00:28:49.710" style="s2">devil spawn anyway because he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.500" end="00:28:51.930" style="s2">know the narrative 101 and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.710" end="00:28:55.230" style="s2">he&#39;s what we must get rid of and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.930" end="00:28:56.790" style="s2">today anybody who admits that Mike Brown</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.230" end="00:28:58.370" style="s2">wasn&#39;t killed that way and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.790" end="00:29:00.890" style="s2">people just like to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.370" end="00:29:02.870" style="s2">John for the legend is printed on some</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.890" end="00:29:05.150" style="s2">level that happened you just know</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.870" end="00:29:06.800" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a film we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.150" end="00:29:09.980" style="s2">point where Mike Brown is shot</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.800" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">everything goes into blurry and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.980" end="00:29:12.770" style="s2">strobe lights and their various</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.480" end="00:29:14.360" style="s2">perspectives and all of a sudden that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.770" end="00:29:16.250" style="s2">gonna be Rashomon as if there are many</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.360" end="00:29:17.480" style="s2">different perspectives and the director</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.250" end="00:29:19.280" style="s2">is gonna give interviews saying they</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.480" end="00:29:21.350" style="s2">wanted to give everybody their say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.280" end="00:29:23.780" style="s2">not gonna just show what happened and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.350" end="00:29:26.750" style="s2">that&#39;s symbolic of the consciousness but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.780" end="00:29:28.190" style="s2">also nowadays you deflect so if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.750" end="00:29:30.200" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk about the Mike Brown</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.190" end="00:29:32.210" style="s2">facts we talk about the fact that he was</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.200" end="00:29:34.730" style="s2">laying on the street for four hours and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.210" end="00:29:36.559" style="s2">that&#39;s unjust I&#39;ve heard people wax</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.730" end="00:29:37.910" style="s2">eloquent about that to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.559" end="00:29:40.010" style="s2">people were talking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.910" end="00:29:43.040" style="s2">perfectly done in with his hands up six</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.010" end="00:29:45.080" style="s2">years ago no Chauvin will never be able</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.040" end="00:29:46.390" style="s2">to raise his head in public again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.080" end="00:29:48.590" style="s2">the same thing with George Zimmerman</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.390" end="00:29:51.170" style="s2">Zimmerman&#39;s story is quite different</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.590" end="00:29:53.300" style="s2">from what we were told and yet his life</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.170" end="00:29:56.150" style="s2">is ruined because these people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.300" end="00:29:58.400" style="s2">needed as symbols in this narrative they</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.150" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">are they&#39;re Judas&#39;s and this is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.400" end="00:30:02.690" style="s2">of thinking that we&#39;re encouraged to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:05.600" style="s2">this is to watch this with people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.690" end="00:30:08.840" style="s2">otherwise think normally and empirically</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.600" end="00:30:11.270" style="s2">it&#39;s a religious frame of mind this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.840" end="00:30:13.880" style="s2">exactly what I&#39;m worried about so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.270" end="00:30:15.410" style="s2">say that he will never get a fair trial</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.880" end="00:30:17.960" style="s2">in the court of public opinion which I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.410" end="00:30:19.670" style="s2">agree I also don&#39;t think he can get a</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.960" end="00:30:22.820" style="s2">fair trial in a courtroom</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.670" end="00:30:26.350" style="s2">at this point because given the way we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.820" end="00:30:29.210" style="s2">are all connected it will be I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.350" end="00:30:31.820" style="s2">impossible to find a jury that will not</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.210" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">be aware that a verdict that does not</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.820" end="00:30:41.900" style="s2">reflect public opinion in this case will</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:43.730" style="s2">result in an eruption of anger that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.900" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s Rodney King times a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.730" end="00:30:50.700" style="s2">thousand and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">here&#39;s the reason I find this so</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.700" end="00:30:59.160" style="s2">terrifying is that I believe some kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:31:02.730" style="s2">of possibly unprecedented trolley</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.160" end="00:31:07.080" style="s2">problem is unfolding in this case and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.730" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">that everybody will quietly calculate to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.080" end="00:31:11.370" style="s2">themselves maybe not even in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:13.980" style="s2">conscious mind but somewhere that in</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.370" end="00:31:16.350" style="s2">fact irrespective of what the facts are</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.980" end="00:31:18.270" style="s2">in the case and you know let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.350" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">George Floyd had a heart attack was</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.270" end="00:31:23.700" style="s2">highly likely to die and that the knee</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:26.300" style="s2">on the neck as egregious as it was it</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.700" end="00:31:28.860" style="s2">was a minor factor in his death right</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.300" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">that would obviously be a very important</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.860" end="00:31:33.810" style="s2">fact in a case were this not racially</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.740" end="00:31:39.150" style="s2">charged and were there no protests in</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.810" end="00:31:44.490" style="s2">the streets but if the system concludes</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.150" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">that it must convict him then this</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.490" end="00:31:50.940" style="s2">effectively is us participating in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:52.470" style="s2">witch-hunt now I&#39;m not saying that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.940" end="00:31:54.630" style="s2">not guilty of murder I think it&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.470" end="00:31:56.190" style="s2">he is guilty of murder but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.630" end="00:31:57.900" style="s2">that he&#39;s guilty of murder yet and my</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.190" end="00:31:59.610" style="s2">sense is that we have already marked so</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.900" end="00:32:01.380" style="s2">far down this road we are already now</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.610" end="00:32:03.390" style="s2">speaking as if we can all agree that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.380" end="00:32:05.690" style="s2">he&#39;s guilty of murder here the doubt</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.390" end="00:32:11.640" style="s2">exists where the question of race is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.690" end="00:32:14.460" style="s2">that we are unwittingly participating in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.640" end="00:32:16.200" style="s2">a dangerous religious exercise even</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.460" end="00:32:17.190" style="s2">those of us who wish to resist doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.200" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">that at all costs</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.190" end="00:32:20.940" style="s2">you know what&#39;s alarming there is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:23.490" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is that this is going</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.940" end="00:32:25.770" style="s2">to go beyond people being unable to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.490" end="00:32:29.250" style="s2">justice in the rarefied world of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.770" end="00:32:30.810" style="s2">college campus where one wonders whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.250" end="00:32:33.330" style="s2">that could change within our lifetimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.810" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to be in actual courts of</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:40.650" style="s2">physical life and death and yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.150" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">alarming especially because you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.650" end="00:32:44.940" style="s2">there is this critical race theory</p>

<p begin="00:32:46.950" end="00:32:51.270" style="s2">of general stories and as pretty as that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.470" end="00:32:53.910" style="s2">sounds that&#39;s the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.270" end="00:32:56.190" style="s2">leads to the idea that even if on some</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.129" end="00:33:09.330" style="s2">on some other level on some narrative</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:11.730" style="s2">level because this has been happening to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.330" end="00:33:13.110" style="s2">us forever and although most of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.730" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">people on that hypothetical jury</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.110" end="00:33:18.360" style="s2">probably don&#39;t read critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:20.940" style="s2">that way of thinking is percolating into</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.360" end="00:33:22.649" style="s2">the general consciousness and what might</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.940" end="00:33:25.289" style="s2">be alarming is that it&#39;s no longer just</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.649" end="00:33:26.999" style="s2">people with PhDs and the equivalent its</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.289" end="00:33:28.950" style="s2">beginning not to be just people who read</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.999" end="00:33:32.690" style="s2">The New Yorker and listen to NPR it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.950" end="00:33:35.759" style="s2">beginning to just be folks that is um</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.690" end="00:33:37.830" style="s2">that is alarming if that is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.759" end="00:33:38.999" style="s2">going and the verdict on Chauvin I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.830" end="00:33:41.399" style="s2">know that they say show then and show</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.999" end="00:33:43.710" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna say Shoven Chauvin could</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.399" end="00:33:46.830" style="s2">be seen as a bellwether of that yes that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.710" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">that is true that this time he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.830" end="00:33:50.580" style="s2">get off despite the fact that the facts</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:55.320" style="s2">are muddy and that even civilians like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.580" end="00:33:57.090" style="s2">us can see yeah that is alarming and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.320" end="00:34:00.509" style="s2">then what happens breath where are we</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.090" end="00:34:03.869" style="s2">going oh my goodness I&#39;m afraid if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.509" end="00:34:07.700" style="s2">are not very careful that we are staring</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.869" end="00:34:13.109" style="s2">at the uninvented of the Republic and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.700" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that that that idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.109" end="00:34:17.909" style="s2">thought that possibility properly</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:21.179" style="s2">horrifies people because as flawed as</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.909" end="00:34:23.909" style="s2">this Republic is it&#39;s uninvent is going</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.179" end="00:34:25.470" style="s2">to be an absolute disaster and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.909" end="00:34:28.349" style="s2">frankly this is something that is more</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.470" end="00:34:30.149" style="s2">easily seen by people outside the US and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.349" end="00:34:31.409" style="s2">I&#39;ve had contact with quite a number who</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.149" end="00:34:34.619" style="s2">are frightened at what they are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.409" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">unfold even though they know our system</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.619" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">is unfair but the prospect of the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:46.859" style="s2">failing is is a dangerous one for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:50.220" style="s2">world so there&#39;s a lot riding on this as</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.859" end="00:34:52.950" style="s2">to your point about what is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.220" end="00:34:56.780" style="s2">going to unfold in courtrooms given the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.950" end="00:34:59.280" style="s2">rhetoric and given how aggressive the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.780" end="00:35:02.250" style="s2">campaign is that is causing people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.280" end="00:35:03.210" style="s2">adopt this critical race theory now most</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.250" end="00:35:05.220" style="s2">of them don&#39;t know that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.210" end="00:35:08.030" style="s2">they&#39;re adopting and I should also say</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.220" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">everything that you don&#39;t no longer</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.030" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">write you&#39;re just you&#39;re active in it</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:14.730" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know where it came from or</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:15.690" style="s2">what it actually means I also should say</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.730" end="00:35:18.180" style="s2">my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.690" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">the critical race theory was born as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.180" end="00:35:23.460" style="s2">honorable investigation of biases inside</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:27.240" style="s2">courtrooms and then it sort of morphed</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.460" end="00:35:31.410" style="s2">into this monster but but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.240" end="00:35:36.060" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned that we are actually much</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.410" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">closer to the the place that you suggest</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.060" end="00:35:39.210" style="s2">we might be headed with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:41.849" style="s2">courtrooms because in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.210" end="00:35:44.069" style="s2">beliefs that are being now commonly</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.849" end="00:35:48.030" style="s2">expressed without the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.069" end="00:35:53.970" style="s2">disagree with them there is certain to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.030" end="00:35:56.310" style="s2">be a two-tiered expression of due</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.970" end="00:36:00.569" style="s2">process in a courtroom in other words</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.310" end="00:36:02.550" style="s2">those who are understood to be suffering</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.569" end="00:36:05.339" style="s2">from a history of oppression will</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.550" end="00:36:07.670" style="s2">experience a bias in their favor and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.339" end="00:36:10.680" style="s2">those who were understood to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.670" end="00:36:13.319" style="s2">the race that has been perpetrating the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.680" end="00:36:15.810" style="s2">oppression will face a very different</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.319" end="00:36:18.569" style="s2">standard now the really difficult part</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.810" end="00:36:20.339" style="s2">about this is that there is some truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.569" end="00:36:22.980" style="s2">to the fact that the reverse of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.339" end="00:36:26.430" style="s2">situation has existed in courts since</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.980" end="00:36:29.490" style="s2">the Republic was founded right so black</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.430" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">people have had a raw deal not only</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.490" end="00:36:33.089" style="s2">economically for reasons I&#39;d love to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:34.680" style="s2">back to if there&#39;s time and if not this</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.089" end="00:36:39.150" style="s2">time we&#39;ll do it in a future</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.680" end="00:36:41.730" style="s2">conversation but the system has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.150" end="00:36:45.180" style="s2">unfair and it has been two-tiered but we</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.730" end="00:36:47.369" style="s2">are actually now involved in a public</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:50.520" style="s2">discussion in which instead of ending</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.369" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">oppression which has been the the goal</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.520" end="00:36:55.349" style="s2">since the civil rights movement we are</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.810" style="s2">actually talking about turning the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.349" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">tables of oppression turning the tables</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.810" end="00:37:04.650" style="s2">and creating the inversion of the values</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:08.609" style="s2">that the nation is founded on and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.650" end="00:37:11.910" style="s2">is a very dangerous idea it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.609" end="00:37:15.300" style="s2">bound to be unstable and we will all</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.910" end="00:37:17.640" style="s2">suffer from it bound to be unstable of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.300" end="00:37:20.099" style="s2">course the people who are hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.640" end="00:37:23.550" style="s2">this really takes over are under the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.099" end="00:37:26.550" style="s2">impression that once we accomplish this</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.550" end="00:37:28.260" style="s2">anti-racist goal that everything would</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.550" end="00:37:29.819" style="s2">be ok I get the feeling they think it</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.260" end="00:37:31.499" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be unstable</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.819" end="00:37:33.150" style="s2">I think that what&#39;s happened before has</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.499" end="00:37:35.999" style="s2">been unstable in the rhetoric would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.150" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">because you know you you adopt what</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.999" end="00:37:41.729" style="s2">James Baldwin didn&#39;t exactly mean that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:43.289" style="s2">white people&#39;s identity depends on their</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.729" end="00:37:46.109" style="s2">being black people below that white</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.289" end="00:37:47.400" style="s2">people are deeply deeply unstable</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.109" end="00:37:49.349" style="s2">psychologically because of their</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:50.940" style="s2">feelings about black people and because</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.349" end="00:37:52.769" style="s2">of racism and they need to face it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.940" end="00:37:55.529" style="s2">order to be whole etc so the idea would</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.769" end="00:37:57.900" style="s2">be that once we get beyond this then</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.529" end="00:37:59.549" style="s2">everything would be alright what they</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.900" end="00:38:02.779" style="s2">don&#39;t understand is that they would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.549" end="00:38:05.489" style="s2">busting everything down based upon an</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.779" end="00:38:08.099" style="s2">uncompromising kind of ideology that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.489" end="00:38:11.099" style="s2">could never create a true consensus and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.099" end="00:38:13.499" style="s2">we&#39;d only be on to worse things and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.099" end="00:38:16.619" style="s2">there&#39;s so much that would be wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.499" end="00:38:19.130" style="s2">that society i i probably lack a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.619" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">bit of imagination i&#39;m not i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.130" end="00:38:24.089" style="s2">looking at this as cleanly as you are i</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:26.339" style="s2">suspect into my tendency is to think</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.089" end="00:38:29.249" style="s2">that this is a pendulum shift that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.339" end="00:38:31.349" style="s2">things tend to go too far and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.249" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">things come back to a healthy middle</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.349" end="00:38:34.739" style="s2">that&#39;s even happened with race ideology</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:36.029" style="s2">you could have watched the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.739" end="00:38:38.670" style="s2">things people were saying in the late</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.029" end="00:38:41.400" style="s2">60s you know dashikis and black power</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.670" end="00:38:43.829" style="s2">and i rather in coherent ideology black</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.400" end="00:38:45.209" style="s2">panthers doing some violent things some</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.829" end="00:38:46.799" style="s2">good things as one&#39;s supposed to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.209" end="00:38:49.739" style="s2">about the black panthers but the violent</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.799" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">aspect as well and you might have</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.739" end="00:38:53.069" style="s2">thought that something was really</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:55.380" style="s2">something really scary was going on as</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.069" end="00:38:59.539" style="s2">one would have thought in 1968 in</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.380" end="00:39:02.400" style="s2">general all and nevertheless by 1980 all</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.539" end="00:39:04.979" style="s2">those things had been tempered some what</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.400" end="00:39:06.719" style="s2">society had been changed attitudes on</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.590" end="00:39:56.580" style="s2">forward from many of us find it a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.230" end="00:39:58.290" style="s2">forward idea to not base any of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.580" end="00:40:00.510" style="s2">cognition to the extent that we know it</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.290" end="00:40:02.100" style="s2">on suspension of disbelief many of us</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.510" end="00:40:03.870" style="s2">think of that as progress I would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.100" end="00:40:06.900" style="s2">fake if I did not say that I do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.870" end="00:40:09.510" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m sorry to those whom that seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.900" end="00:40:12.210" style="s2">to insult but I have to be honest and to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.510" end="00:40:14.760" style="s2">go back to having this kind of mental</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.210" end="00:40:16.020" style="s2">cocoon where you are encouraged to stop</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.760" end="00:40:18.360" style="s2">thought and thought that that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.020" end="00:40:20.040" style="s2">a more only advance person that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.360" end="00:40:22.680" style="s2">frightening I wonder though right you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.040" end="00:40:25.340" style="s2">know it can&#39;t be just books it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.680" end="00:40:27.990" style="s2">just podcasts what about a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.340" end="00:40:30.210" style="s2">moving that here there needs to be good</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.990" end="00:40:32.520" style="s2">90-minute documentary that really gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.210" end="00:40:34.440" style="s2">across what&#39;s wrong with this and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.520" end="00:40:36.840" style="s2">know probably not next week it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.440" end="00:40:39.120" style="s2">need to be you know during our</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.840" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">conversation about George Floyd but</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.120" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">there needs to be a statement against</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.520" end="00:40:46.680" style="s2">this that people can actually watch and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:48.270" style="s2">it actually makes people think I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.680" end="00:40:51.720" style="s2">it can be pushed back against partly</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.270" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s one of my matey A&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.720" end="00:40:55.950" style="s2">you think that it could possibly just</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:41:00.300" style="s2">topple the United States I do I think we</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.950" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">might be looking at well let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.300" end="00:41:06.380" style="s2">this way I think what I&#39;m seeing in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:12.120" style="s2">street reminds me far too much of maoism</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.380" end="00:41:14.730" style="s2">and that if you attempt a Maoist</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.120" end="00:41:18.630" style="s2">takeover in the US you will get a civil</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.730" end="00:41:21.510" style="s2">war so I am very concerned that we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.630" end="00:41:25.230" style="s2">much closer to a brink that frankly I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.510" end="00:41:28.140" style="s2">think we all know is out there somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.230" end="00:41:30.080" style="s2">but then you worry that do you remember</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.140" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">that right-wing crazies are gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.080" end="00:41:37.620" style="s2">gunning well here&#39;s the I&#39;m hesitant to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.900" style="s2">say right-wing crazies because what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.620" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">think the problem is I full well</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.900" end="00:41:45.090" style="s2">understand looking at people tearing</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">apart cities saying things that make no</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.090" end="00:41:49.350" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:51.630" style="s2">you know claiming that on inventing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.350" end="00:41:53.720" style="s2">police that you know abolishing them</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.630" end="00:41:57.830" style="s2">would be progress</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.720" end="00:41:59.869" style="s2">that there unfortunately the people that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.830" end="00:42:01.849" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about have more of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.869" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">point than they should which is this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.849" end="00:42:05.720" style="s2">madness</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:07.880" style="s2">right so I don&#39;t want them to have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.720" end="00:42:10.520" style="s2">point I don&#39;t want a civil war what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.880" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">want is for people to sober up and stop</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.520" end="00:42:16.040" style="s2">behaving in this way but I also having</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:22.220" style="s2">seen a mini version of this know better</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.040" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">right so I would put on your radar if</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.220" end="00:42:30.050" style="s2">you&#39;re not thinking about it yet the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:32.660" style="s2">coincidence of shut down stem traveling</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.050" end="00:42:36.770" style="s2">with this religious belief system that</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.660" end="00:42:40.790" style="s2">you and I both see is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.770" end="00:42:43.580" style="s2">important there is a reason that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.790" end="00:42:46.760" style="s2">religious movement that we see in our</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.580" end="00:42:49.880" style="s2">streets is also talking about shutting</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.760" end="00:42:51.710" style="s2">down stem and we saw this all in</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.880" end="00:42:53.869" style="s2">miniature at Evergreen they came after</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.710" end="00:42:55.790" style="s2">stem also there was a reason that it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.869" end="00:42:59.170" style="s2">me they came after they went after my</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:43:02.260" style="s2">students too in fact one of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.170" end="00:43:05.810" style="s2">mixed-race student woman whose mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.260" end="00:43:07.940" style="s2">afro-caribbean was actually confronted</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.810" end="00:43:10.609" style="s2">by the rioters and accused of race</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.940" end="00:43:13.910" style="s2">trading for being a science student so</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.609" end="00:43:16.550" style="s2">this anti science belief system is</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.910" end="00:43:20.359" style="s2">infused into this critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.550" end="00:43:23.510" style="s2">religion that we see mm-hmm protesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.359" end="00:43:27.170" style="s2">and rioting and so the threat that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.510" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">poses to our ability even if you had</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.170" end="00:43:31.369" style="s2">this documentary that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:34.280" style="s2">about it would be I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.369" end="00:43:38.150" style="s2">can is their documentary burning they</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.280" end="00:43:40.550" style="s2">will be burning right and effectively it</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.150" end="00:43:43.730" style="s2">will only reach those who already in</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.550" end="00:43:45.770" style="s2">some sense know better so I&#39;m I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.730" end="00:43:47.570" style="s2">watching this thing take over people who</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.770" end="00:43:49.310" style="s2">should know better and so that says</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.570" end="00:43:51.140" style="s2">something about the mechanism of action</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.310" end="00:43:53.720" style="s2">the arguments that are being deployed</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.140" end="00:43:55.970" style="s2">are really low quality but the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.720" end="00:43:58.550" style="s2">of action is really powerful the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.970" end="00:44:02.060" style="s2">strategy is very very strong it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.550" end="00:44:02.930" style="s2">smart strategy so I don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.060" end="00:44:05.540" style="s2">that leaves us</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.930" end="00:44:07.730" style="s2">now as to your point about it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.540" end="00:44:10.490" style="s2">podcasts I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.730" end="00:44:12.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve increasingly started to wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.490" end="00:44:15.770" style="s2">one of the problems that we face is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.650" end="00:44:18.410" style="s2">the people who should be in a leadership</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.770" end="00:44:20.330" style="s2">position people who could say something</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.410" end="00:44:22.340" style="s2">could shut down the bad arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.330" end="00:44:24.740" style="s2">substitutes that earlier and that those</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.340" end="00:44:27.290" style="s2">people are I would say trapped in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.740" end="00:44:29.300" style="s2">gig economy and they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.290" end="00:44:31.100" style="s2">power of leaders because everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.300" end="00:44:33.050" style="s2">click away they don&#39;t you know a leader</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.100" end="00:44:35.810" style="s2">can tell you something you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.050" end="00:44:37.700" style="s2">know but you need to know somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.810" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">you know you&#39;re deciding to watch them</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.700" end="00:44:40.970" style="s2">and as soon as they start saying things</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">that you don&#39;t like you go find somebody</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.970" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">who says stuff you like better that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:48.050" style="s2">not a leadership position and so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">wonder if part of what&#39;s taking place is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.050" end="00:44:53.480" style="s2">that the transformation of the way we</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:56.240" style="s2">interact with each other has ruined the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.480" end="00:44:59.300" style="s2">concept of leadership and a leaderless</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.240" end="00:45:02.170" style="s2">movement is a dangerous movement because</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.300" end="00:45:06.530" style="s2">it&#39;s inherently going to subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.170" end="00:45:11.180" style="s2">pleasant fantasies utopia among them you</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.530" end="00:45:15.830" style="s2">know you&#39;re scaring me but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.180" end="00:45:19.550" style="s2">venture this if what we&#39;re really seeing</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.830" end="00:45:21.770" style="s2">is a pendulum shift like on the campuses</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.550" end="00:45:23.960" style="s2">like this is not remotely to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.770" end="00:45:25.340" style="s2">what happened to you but when that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.960" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">happened to you there were many of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.340" end="00:45:28.910" style="s2">including you who were thinking and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re saying about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.910" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">whole attitude towards stem and how</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:34.190" style="s2">insidious that could be but we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">thinking is this college is this what</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.190" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be to be at a university</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">from now on and as I&#39;ve been observing</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:41.630" style="s2">lately in the historical sense that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:43.730" style="s2">actually only a few years in the mid</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.630" end="00:45:46.010" style="s2">teens that was kind of a fashion and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.730" end="00:45:47.660" style="s2">watch it happened tomorrow somewhere but</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.010" end="00:45:49.970" style="s2">you notice there&#39;s a cluster of events</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.660" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">like that and then it kind of stopped</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.970" end="00:45:53.450" style="s2">and I think it was partly because of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:55.190" style="s2">pushback against it from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.450" end="00:45:58.070" style="s2">sensible people it&#39;s not that I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.190" end="00:45:59.600" style="s2">anybody was reading an op-ed in The</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.070" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">Chronicle of Higher Education and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.600" end="00:46:03.470" style="s2">decided not to do with it but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:05.540" style="s2">sure how these things happen but Society</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.470" end="00:46:07.130" style="s2">turned against people getting beat up</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.540" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">when they come to speak on a campus and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.130" end="00:46:11.540" style="s2">in this case if that happens after about</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:12.650" style="s2">three years and we&#39;ve got about three</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.540" end="00:46:14.630" style="s2">years to wait this out</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.650" end="00:46:16.369" style="s2">if that happens the good thing that will</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.630" end="00:46:19.190" style="s2">have come out of it is that I think it</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.369" end="00:46:21.140" style="s2">has been resoundingly proven that people</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.190" end="00:46:23.660" style="s2">like Tallahassee Coates are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.140" end="00:46:25.910" style="s2">in their sense that America is this</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.660" end="00:46:27.560" style="s2">place that&#39;s utterly united against</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.910" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">black people on all levels and that</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.480" end="00:47:19.580" style="s2">mean so strongly here&#39;s here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.420" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">concern I also thought that we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.580" end="00:47:25.310" style="s2">actually turning the tide on college</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:26.870" style="s2">campuses and you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.310" end="00:47:28.460" style="s2">reason to think that what happened at</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.870" end="00:47:30.490" style="s2">Reed for example is very different than</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.460" end="00:47:33.190" style="s2">Evergreen even if it started out similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.490" end="00:47:35.930" style="s2">but I actually think something else</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.190" end="00:47:38.270" style="s2">explains the fact that this has died</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.930" end="00:47:41.000" style="s2">down on college campuses and it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.270" end="00:47:44.900" style="s2">helpful which is that in some sense this</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.000" end="00:47:47.750" style="s2">is a millennial delusion and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.900" end="00:47:51.290" style="s2">mean it&#39;s all Millennials my wife and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.750" end="00:47:53.030" style="s2">you know Heather we taught mostly</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.290" end="00:47:54.920" style="s2">Millennials for the entire time we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.030" end="00:47:56.330" style="s2">teaching and have a great many</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.920" end="00:47:58.010" style="s2">millennial friends so we know there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.330" end="00:47:59.570" style="s2">lots of people in that generation who</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.010" end="00:48:05.720" style="s2">can think very carefully but there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.570" end="00:48:08.960" style="s2">also a kind of tendency to embrace this</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.720" end="00:48:12.170" style="s2">mode of thinking that has now left</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.960" end="00:48:15.140" style="s2">college and it&#39;s now inside of all these</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.170" end="00:48:18.140" style="s2">other institutions and so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.140" end="00:48:19.610" style="s2">we are seeing the same battle that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.140" end="00:48:21.890" style="s2">saw at Evergreen now apparently</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.610" end="00:48:24.080" style="s2">unfolding inside the New York Times and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.890" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">every other journalistic apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.080" end="00:48:29.090" style="s2">that&#39;s to me not a hopeful sign because</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:31.670" style="s2">it means that now we&#39;re not dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.090" end="00:48:33.650" style="s2">the the toy version we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.670" end="00:48:34.289" style="s2">this with all of the stuff on which we</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.650" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">depend</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.289" end="00:48:41.189" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a helpful</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:43.559" style="s2">thought you know Brett I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.189" end="00:48:45.749" style="s2">fun I think we should we should do a</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.559" end="00:48:47.579" style="s2">part two and we should do a part two</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.749" end="00:48:49.319" style="s2">when I&#39;m in my home and there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.579" end="00:48:51.929" style="s2">in it and the shower doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.319" end="00:48:55.979" style="s2">fixed because no you&#39;re really making me</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.929" end="00:48:59.009" style="s2">think about these things and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.979" end="00:49:01.679" style="s2">though is that college generations</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.009" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">reproduce themselves and I get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.679" end="00:49:06.839" style="s2">that the people from 10 minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:08.459" style="s2">who were hollering on campuses are now</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.839" end="00:49:09.929" style="s2">interns of the New York Times or</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.459" end="00:49:12.989" style="s2">something like that but wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.929" end="00:49:15.059" style="s2">expect that succeeding freshman classes</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.989" end="00:49:17.579" style="s2">would have kept doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.059" end="00:49:20.429" style="s2">because I pass it on one to another what</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.579" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">if it was or if it was just one three or</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.429" end="00:49:23.999" style="s2">four year cohort who then went and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:25.559" style="s2">carried it somewhere else in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.999" end="00:49:26.819" style="s2">that&#39;s good news because it would mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.559" end="00:49:28.439" style="s2">that these people will just keep getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.819" end="00:49:30.449" style="s2">older and older and their current jobs</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.439" end="00:49:32.309" style="s2">and then they&#39;ll become these graying</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.449" end="00:49:33.509" style="s2">people who are you know strangely angry</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.309" end="00:49:35.699" style="s2">but then there&#39;s this whole generation</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.509" end="00:49:37.499" style="s2">below them that aren&#39;t it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.699" end="00:49:40.679" style="s2">that usually these things are passed on</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.499" end="00:49:42.809" style="s2">to the people who are slightly younger</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.679" end="00:49:44.999" style="s2">and somehow that didn&#39;t happen and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.809" end="00:49:47.339" style="s2">may be just I&#39;m speaking from Columbia</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.999" end="00:49:50.249" style="s2">where for mysterious reasons nothing</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.339" end="00:49:52.409" style="s2">like that ever really happened so I made</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.249" end="00:49:54.959" style="s2">me feel more sanguine because protests</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.409" end="00:49:56.009" style="s2">at Columbia are small and brief as</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.959" end="00:49:58.049" style="s2">opposed to there having ever been</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.009" end="00:50:00.869" style="s2">anything that made the news other than</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.049" end="00:50:02.669" style="s2">the controversal kibbutz is controversy</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.869" end="00:50:04.739" style="s2">the Mattress controversy and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.669" end="00:50:06.359" style="s2">really very different set of issues than</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.739" end="00:50:08.579" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about here although</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.359" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an intersection but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.579" end="00:50:12.209" style="s2">don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">I hope I&#39;m right too only because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.209" end="00:50:17.729" style="s2">would be frightening for this country to</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:20.219" style="s2">be taken over by people who refuse to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.729" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">reason and don&#39;t know that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.219" end="00:50:23.069" style="s2">they&#39;re doing they don&#39;t know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:24.599" style="s2">refusing the reason they think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.069" end="00:50:26.759" style="s2">there are certain issues upon which</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.599" end="00:50:30.329" style="s2">there can be no reasoning and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.759" end="00:50:32.459" style="s2">literally can&#39;t talk to them they cannot</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.329" end="00:50:33.959" style="s2">be reasoned with and put them in</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.459" end="00:50:35.939" style="s2">positions of power and next thing you</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.959" end="00:50:37.969" style="s2">know the country does start to disappear</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.939" end="00:50:42.650" style="s2">that is that is a very frightening</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.969" end="00:50:47.630" style="s2">prospect yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s very frightening</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.650" end="00:50:50.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we can stand even a brief</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.630" end="00:50:51.560" style="s2">period in which this modality rules I</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.180" end="00:50:56.060" style="s2">don&#39;t think it will happen it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.560" end="00:50:58.340" style="s2">me to conceive of how it would last long</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.060" end="00:51:02.360" style="s2">enough but my concern is what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.340" end="00:51:04.850" style="s2">destruct disrupts in the meantime so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.360" end="00:51:09.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know again I am definitely rooting</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.850" end="00:51:11.000" style="s2">for you to be right but I I do think we</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.710" end="00:51:14.410" style="s2">at least need to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.000" end="00:51:17.690" style="s2">possibility that what we are seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.410" end="00:51:20.210" style="s2">demographic its aging into power and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.690" end="00:51:23.690" style="s2">that that has frightening implications</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.210" end="00:51:27.380" style="s2">if we don&#39;t get around it and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.690" end="00:51:30.940" style="s2">the two last points would be it does</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.380" end="00:51:33.710" style="s2">raise a question about how we can reboot</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.940" end="00:51:35.630" style="s2">leadership so that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.710" end="00:51:37.810" style="s2">that can be reasoned with there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.630" end="00:51:40.160" style="s2">someone on the other side who&#39;s ready to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.810" end="00:51:42.290" style="s2">to have the discussion about what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.160" end="00:51:45.310" style="s2">actually taking place and what an actual</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.290" end="00:51:47.900" style="s2">remedy might sound like rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.310" end="00:51:49.970" style="s2">narrative that&#39;s being deployed which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.900" end="00:51:53.090" style="s2">so inaccurate that any remedy to it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.970" end="00:51:55.250" style="s2">bound to backfire and I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.090" end="00:51:57.710" style="s2">leaders recruited even recently who</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.250" end="00:51:59.360" style="s2">clearly part of why they were recruited</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.710" end="00:52:02.090" style="s2">as leaders it&#39;s because they speak this</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.360" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">new language and these are leaders who</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.090" end="00:52:05.630" style="s2">have no idea that speaking a language</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:07.390" style="s2">but and I&#39;ll bet the people who vetted</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.630" end="00:52:09.590" style="s2">them weren&#39;t thinking consciously of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.390" end="00:52:11.420" style="s2">what they were vetting the people for</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.590" end="00:52:14.900" style="s2">but a person wouldn&#39;t have made it</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.420" end="00:52:16.550" style="s2">through who didn&#39;t have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.900" end="00:52:19.460" style="s2">stop reasoning when it came to issues of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.550" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">race that&#39;s scary to see and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.460" end="00:52:22.520" style="s2">thinking about people who are in their</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:26.090" style="s2">40s who were recruited in this way</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.520" end="00:52:29.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not kids so yeah I know what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.090" end="00:52:32.030" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s creepy it&#39;s creepy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.720" end="00:52:34.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s why I&#39;m going a book I am doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.030" end="00:52:36.470" style="s2">a book about Third Way for anti racism</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.280" end="00:52:38.660" style="s2">it&#39;s pouring out of me as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.470" end="00:52:40.340" style="s2">channeled from someone else I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.660" end="00:52:42.080" style="s2">where this book is coming from but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.340" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">just realized that something is really</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.080" end="00:52:48.020" style="s2">really wrong but a book alone isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:50.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to do it the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.020" end="00:52:53.990" style="s2">to really change society you have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.510" end="00:52:56.060" style="s2">working title no the title of this one</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.990" end="00:52:57.770" style="s2">I&#39;m waiting for whoever is channelling</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.060" end="00:52:59.180" style="s2">this book through me to give me a title</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.770" end="00:53:00.470" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to coming up with titles</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.180" end="00:53:02.300" style="s2">but it&#39;s got to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.470" end="00:53:04.190" style="s2">if you have any ideas let me know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.300" end="00:53:08.450" style="s2">got to have a catchy title and the title</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.190" end="00:53:12.950" style="s2">can&#39;t be fuck all of you that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.450" end="00:53:14.780" style="s2">already taken something a little more</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.950" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">constructive and I don&#39;t have the title</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.780" end="00:53:21.860" style="s2">either so I like your idea of a part two</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:27.980" style="s2">of this conversation I want to propose a</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.860" end="00:53:33.110" style="s2">starting place okay there is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.980" end="00:53:36.760" style="s2">about the origin story of the American</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.110" end="00:53:39.290" style="s2">black population that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.760" end="00:53:42.130" style="s2">mirrored not perfectly but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.290" end="00:53:45.590" style="s2">mirrored with respect to Africa to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.130" end="00:53:49.190" style="s2">Indians to American Indians and it has</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.590" end="00:53:54.230" style="s2">to do with the systemic disruption of</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.190" end="00:53:59.240" style="s2">culture that took place when the US was</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.230" end="00:54:01.700" style="s2">formed or even before and in any case I</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.240" end="00:54:03.500" style="s2">think this fits perfectly with one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.700" end="00:54:05.420" style="s2">your primary areas of study because this</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.500" end="00:54:08.660" style="s2">is what a pidgin this is why a pidgin</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.420" end="00:54:11.080" style="s2">emerges before a Creole and so in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.660" end="00:54:16.450" style="s2">sense what I would like to discuss is</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.080" end="00:54:20.450" style="s2">whether or not the pervasive sense that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.450" end="00:54:24.440" style="s2">opportunity is somehow held back from</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.450" end="00:54:27.530" style="s2">the population of black Americans if</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.440" end="00:54:29.750" style="s2">this is not rooted in that special</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.530" end="00:54:32.420" style="s2">origin story and if that does not</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.750" end="00:54:35.510" style="s2">actually point in the direction of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.420" end="00:54:38.150" style="s2">real remedies might be in other words if</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.510" end="00:54:41.390" style="s2">the frustration is real the diagnosis is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.150" end="00:54:42.770" style="s2">wrong but a correct diagnosis would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.390" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.770" end="00:54:48.110" style="s2">maybe we can navigate our way to a I</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:51.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know a prototype of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.110" end="00:54:53.750" style="s2">discussion it&#39;s interesting that you use</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.260" end="00:54:56.540" style="s2">the word prototype for reasons that I</p>
