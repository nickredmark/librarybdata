<p begin="00:00:04.420" end="00:00:07.691" style="s2">Well, I was about 18 when I first came to London</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.700" end="00:00:10.280" style="s2">It was the first trip I took to Europe</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.280" end="00:00:14.800" style="s2">I&#39;d saved up money for a whole year to travel through Europe for a few months with some friends of mine</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.820" end="00:00:19.799" style="s2">It was the age of London that really struck me, because I had come in from Western Canada and hadn&#39;t traveled much at that point</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">And of course Western Canada - the town I grew up in was only established in the 1930s, really</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">And to walk into pubs that had been around for five or six hundred years was...</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">...something unheard of in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:35.020" style="s2">The magnificence of the architecture and the fact that things were built to last...</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.020" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">The Parliament Buildings are remarkable and the castles.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:42.090" style="s2">And the depth of history and the stability of the country all of that - and the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.090" end="00:00:45.340" style="s2">It&#39;s all an amazing achievement, as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:53.320" style="s2">One of the things that we learned in the West, and one of the things that&#39;s part of the great English journalistic tradition is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.320" end="00:00:58.180" style="s2">Journalists in particular, have the freedom to say what they want and think what they want and that keeps everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.180" end="00:01:00.958" style="s2">including the journalists - honest and on track</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:02.600" style="s2">And we sacrifice that...</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.600" end="00:01:07.720" style="s2">...especially at the feet of the idea that no one is to be oppressed by anything anyone else says.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.760" end="00:01:10.240" style="s2">We sacrifice that at our complete peril.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.300" end="00:01:14.040" style="s2">It&#39;s the Cardinal right...</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.040" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">...because when people speak freely they&#39;re able to think.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">And people orient themselves in the world by thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:23.960" style="s2">and they re-update the state by thinking and they...</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.960" end="00:01:26.120" style="s2">...conquer unknown lands by thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.120" end="00:01:29.500" style="s2">and if you put restrictions on their ability to speak freely...</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.500" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">...then you put restrictions on their ability to think and all of those other processes grind to a halt...</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:36.800" style="s2">...and then everyone suffers for it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.800" end="00:01:38.680" style="s2">[inaudible conversation]</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">I started reading George Orwell when I was a kid - about 13 or 14</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">And I read &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, of course because that&#39;s the books that everyone starts with.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:50.500" style="s2">And then later in my life...</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.500" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">...I became aware of how prescient George Orwell was with regards to the dangers of totalitarianism...</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:02:00.110" style="s2">He was one of the first intellectuals in the West to sound the alarm about what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.110" end="00:02:01.540" style="s2">especially in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.540" end="00:02:05.300" style="s2">Orwell is definitely one of my intellectual heroes from the 20th century.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.300" end="00:02:07.340" style="s2">He&#39;s been a hero of mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.340" end="00:02:08.240" style="s2">He&#39;s been a hero of mine consistently.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.160" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">Britain holds a special place in the hearts of Canadians...</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.043" end="00:02:13.460" style="s2">...and for good reason, you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.480" end="00:02:16.060" style="s2">You guys got so many things right:</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.060" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">English common law tradition, and the parliamentary tradition...</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.502" end="00:02:24.320" style="s2">It&#39;s been a great gift to everywhere in the world, as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>
