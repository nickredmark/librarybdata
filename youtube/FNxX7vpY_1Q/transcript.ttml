<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">too ridiculous and i actually i had so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">many people that voted for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">i had a huge populist support base i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">more than i don&#39;t consider myself a</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">a populist in the transhumanist sphere</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">and i had so many people</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">that were working on my campaign but</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">apparently like some elitist oligarchs</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">at the top they were a little upset</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">that i was not the right public</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">relations</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">person um all i can say is i might be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">little out there but i am not a cannibal</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">so i would have been better pr than that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">guy um and i actually i don&#39;t even refer</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">to myself as a transgenist anymore i</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">call myself a futurist</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">i feel like transhumanism is mostly just</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">focused on immortality where my interest</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">more cybernetics artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">virtual reality um just like extending</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">human capacity um</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">and i think uh the life extension sector</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">of transhumanism has become like just</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">another facet of public health</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">and i really don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">movement that is going to grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">because they&#39;re just trying to you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">get in with the public</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">health community and i&#39;m like no we</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.159" style="s2">should be building incredible things</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">with technology so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.159" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">definitely a difference of vision yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">well now well since you came in second</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">now that the cannibal has been booted do</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">you become the nominee</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that i would do anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">transgenders related again</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not interested in the united states</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">because the narrative it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">interested in you you know the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t interested in you and every time</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">in this circus so the the surface the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">simulation the matrix the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s certainly a bizarre</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">faith uh bad information and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">sprinkled here and there the occasional</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">yeah yeah and the occasional gem is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">usually found outside of the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">yeah at least outside of the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:57.599" style="s2">mainstream narrative you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">truthfully i don&#39;t even go on facebook</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">was probably jordan hall and the person</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">definitely a happening thing trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">get us out of the current</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">basin of attraction where our society</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">seems to be stuck</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">self-terminating trajectory and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">going to die</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">if something isn&#39;t done and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">however we&#39;re ready not to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">do things but to give people advice for</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">how to do things but these people aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">they&#39;re just sitting around strategizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">and accomplishing nothing at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">i see that all time i see another</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">variant on that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">uh two different variants on that one i</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">call it the philosopher fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">that they&#39;re gonna figure it all out</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">from the top done and deliver us a plan</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">how to remake society right</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve see we&#39;ve seen that playbook before</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">nazism</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.680" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">and stalinism i don&#39;t think we need</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">either of those</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">and our world is way too complex and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">know my background is from complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">science the santa fe</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">institute and elsewhere and one of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">is frankly how little we know about</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">predicting how a social system will</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:03.920" style="s2">unfold over time</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">so someone that you know sits on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">mountaintop philosophizing for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">and comes down with a plan and tells us</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">all to do it you know tell them to stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">right and then the other one one of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">current pet peeves is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">people who fall into too much</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">go down the spiritualism rabbit hole and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">have fun talking to themselves but never</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.560" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">get around to talking to anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s definitely a lot of i guess</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">you could call it fear</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">where people they just they view</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">grand strategists who sit around and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">wait for other people to do things and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">then kind of come in and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">take power but what actually happens is</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">they get completely left</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">out um simply because they&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:47.839" style="s2">sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">and strategizing on what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.839" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">people to strategize collaboratively</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">with people who are doing things we</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">need strategy and we need action we need</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">force or so a lot a lot of catholics</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">could allude to to this it&#39;s an inner</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">power you know um of passionate people</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">who who have the this horse inside of</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">that people like curtis</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:05.840" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to exist because they kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">of just want to control everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">um so yeah i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">i think that like having that verse of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">power that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">that inspires you you know some might</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:16.559" style="s2">see as like some type of divinity others</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">might see</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.559" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">some type of delusion on whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">understand it before we go on actually i</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:27.360" style="s2">forgot to ask you this question before</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">my audience isn&#39;t necessarily up on all</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.360" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">the buzzwords around this stuff what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:34.799" style="s2">the dark triad frankly i&#39;m not 100</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:37.039" style="s2">sure myself okay so the dark chart is uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.799" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">three personality traits there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.039" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">machiavellianism</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">there is psychopathy and there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">and we actually i might have the third</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">one wrong it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">while since i&#39;ve like really delved into</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">dark triad i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">narcissism machiavellianism and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:54.960" style="s2">psychopathy</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">so um yeah these are the three traits</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">that apparently</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">make you very hard to work with um</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">there&#39;s something of of that sword i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:05.679" style="s2">because there&#39;s so much volatility</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">you know there&#39;s so much infighting you</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">made for a fascinating conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">uh that in the indigenous perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">the downfall of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">mankind is narcissism the belief that i</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:06.240" style="s2">i said so and that sounds like it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">of this dark triad</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.240" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">i gotta say i don&#39;t think those are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">kind of people that are gonna build the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">future i certainly hope not in fact in</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">the other part of this dark triad thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">you mentioned is uh sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">uh you know one of one of our key</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">analysis is that power attracts</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">in my working days i was involved at</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">pretty high levels in corporate america</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">wall street i even worked in the white</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">house for a little while and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">my perspective is that the sea levels of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">larger american corporations probably 10</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">of the people are sociopaths and that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">not good</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">in our game b world one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">we&#39;re always on the lookout is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">build in</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">institutional structures such that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">are not pulled to the levers of power</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">and part of part of the way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">is by having less levers of power</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">but instead are routed to where they may</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">actually be useful you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:59.279" style="s2">frankly yeah now sociopaths probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">good as a warrior right you want someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.279" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">to just go out go out there and kill</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">right but a sociopath is a leader no</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">thank you very much so i would say if</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">run into a philosophy or an organization</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">where you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">sociopaths and positions of power run</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">don&#39;t walk would be my recommendation</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">and i would also add learn from them um</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">and there was an article i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">at trigger warnings several years ago um</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">2016 actually it&#39;s called the sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">coma and i work to deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">sociopathy for what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">the conclusion that i came to is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">are bound by their puppet master reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">titles and they can&#39;t imagine a world in</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">which they are not pulling the strings</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">so um i don&#39;t know if you know about</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">neural linguistic programming i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">you do actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.120" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">you know about the the law of requisite</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">variety right the more options you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">the more moves you can make</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">you know i have intentionally not dug</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">into the kind of the pop culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">linguistic programming stuff it looked</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">to me a neuro-linguistic program it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">looked at me a little bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:57.679" style="s2">packaged</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">cult kind of thing but i do know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.679" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">about cognitive neuroscience so i may be</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">to react to some not to the packaged pop</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">culture nlp thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">okay yeah and then if you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">about cognitive neuroscience nlp will</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">seem like a joke to you um to other</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">people it&#39;s a way of life um it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">mirroring people</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">finding their dominant senses like if</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.159" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">i see that this is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">really interesting then you want to like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">speak to them</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">and you know i&#39;m visual metaphors or</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">somebody&#39;s like i heard you and then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">want to respond to them</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">in a you know auditory way to get their</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">to gain their dominant sense so you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">build rapport with them um or claim</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">however them depending on how you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">um but what i noticed i&#39;m about the law</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">of requisite variety which</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">simply means that the more options you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">have the more moves you can make that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">this is a game</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">that initially it seems rigged in favor</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">of this sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">because they&#39;re not bound by emotional</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">reactions they don&#39;t have moralistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">impulses</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">they are not stuck in this human</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">cognition frame they</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">can do horrible things and not feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">and they don&#39;t they don&#39;t experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">emotion um</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">but then i started to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">more they don&#39;t have the visceral</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">passion that&#39;s only possible in people</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">who aren&#39;t like that so</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">even though they can imitate emotion</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">they know</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">they&#39;re missing a human core and people</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">they can tell that they&#39;re a bit too</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t possess the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">to display emotional</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">weakness or emotional strength because</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t experience it so this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">sociopaths are at a disadvantage because</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">don&#39;t have the capacity to show that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">are humans with emotions um the best</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">thing they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">do is mimicry that that&#39;s all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">capable of is</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">is mimicry um they&#39;re trapped in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">modality of superficial</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:48.799" style="s2">perfection um and they also can&#39;t build</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">any rapport with people who recognize</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.799" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">them for an actor they conceal their</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">to such a point of dull emptiness that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">obviously you know this is a wolf in</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:00.240" style="s2">sheep&#39;s clothing um</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">i&#39;ve often described as a highly</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.240" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">conscientious person</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">who is excessively civil you know um</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:08.320" style="s2">these are the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">that we need to watch out for we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">the scapegoats the designated villains</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">the uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:14.799" style="s2">you know bad guys of the world that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">constantly getting articles written</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.799" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">about how bad they are</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">um but the worst people are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">that pretend to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">be nice guys and those are the real</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">sociopaths um</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">so my solution about the sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">is that we should have complete mastery</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:32.640" style="s2">over them</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">so and this is back to what you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.640" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">talking about how social hops could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">you know um but we can mimic the games</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">of puppet mastery we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">explore the modality of sociopathy but</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">it&#39;s still a coma</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s somewhat exciting and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.919" end="00:31:48.399" style="s2">entertaining but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">debilitating</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.399" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">in terms of emotional or moral strategy</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">so they lack the tools</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">to connect with other people in a true</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">so what we should do is have complete</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">mastery over them themselves i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">we&#39;re treating them how they treat</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">we might as well respect it we should</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">use sociopaths associated fast few other</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">sociopaths should become our personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">play things um and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">i see the the way to solve this is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">have sociopaths r play things</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">understanding them</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">like they understand other humans feed</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:25.600" style="s2">them at their own game</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">and learn from them learn how to be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:28.799" style="s2">moral</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">emotional person who understands how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.799" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">be a sociopath when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.399" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">need to as long as you don&#39;t hurt</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">anybody i guess you you call me a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">libertarian um</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">i i believe in the nap non-aggression</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">principle as long as you don&#39;t hurt</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">i think what you&#39;re doing is fine um so</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s important to learn from bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">people but not become like them but</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:53.279" style="s2">what their tactics are and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">that this is the best solution that i&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:33.279" style="s2">to my next topic</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">which is you know you i think currently</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">still position yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">as someone who&#39;s interested in the new</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">artwrite you wrote a book by that title</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">and you talk about it from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">what is the new art right and i know it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">has to do with aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">but why don&#39;t you just go with that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">then i&#39;ll get into some questions about</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">the book itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">sure the new writer is the name of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">book it&#39;s a current that i created</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">for people to build a new aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:01.760" style="s2">movement quite simply</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">the conservative mainstream right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">alt-right are just as bad as the social</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">left to me so we need to create options</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">where creative people</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">are able to communicate build and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">without being targeted by social justice</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">mobs</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">and without being annoyed by like</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">bonehead you know like ultra america</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:28.240" style="s2">types you know what i mean so to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">needed and aren&#39;t right full of creative</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.240" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">people that are unbound</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">by the social justice political correct</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">we need to be building our own</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">institutions building our own theater</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">scenes</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">we need to be building our own companies</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">and doing it with our own ethos and um</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">just to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">like i&#39;m not a traditional right-winger</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">in any way</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">my social views are pretty center-left</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">um and economically i&#39;m a centerist at</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">this point if you can believe it i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">radical centrist right um</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">but there is like a metaphysical realm</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">you know on the right that i find a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">more interesting um that&#39;s how i got</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">philosophers like evola on spindler and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">megan</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">and like even more you know um</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">canceled philosophers like yagi um not</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">not because i</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">like agreed with what they&#39;re saying but</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">because i enjoyed exploring</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">that current um i i dubbed the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">term psychic fascism um which is being</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">able to explore fascism</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">without advocating for a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">government or being a fascist yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">letting your mind wander</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">now i&#39;m not sure i get my head around</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:38.480" style="s2">that when i think of fascists i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">enemies of civilization yeah yeah i know</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.480" end="00:35:41.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what i mean is like that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">exactly what they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">but if we have like a more psychic form</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">of that where people are exploring dark</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">areas of their mind and not</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">hurting people okay if we have people</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:55.119" style="s2">that are engaged</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">you know in artistic projects on like</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.119" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">for example a guy he</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">makes a painting that is extremely uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">offensive but it&#39;s also beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">provocative you know um</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">he&#39;s not actually you know advocating</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">for a fascist government but he</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">is you know like displaying imagery that</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">are right should be a community of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">creatives that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">are willing to think as extreme as</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">back a little bit you know i think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">movements that for which aesthetics were</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">significant</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">some of them aren&#39;t such good ones right</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">you think of nazi aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.560" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">kind of a weird mix of german</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">romanticism realism and grieco</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">roman classicism and you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">stalinist</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">socialist realism that actually were</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">taken quite seriously by those regimes</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">but then we look at other revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">that were mostly benevolent and benign</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">and good from society the american</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">and the british glorious revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">1688</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">i would say neither of those had an</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">aesthetic component they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">essentially just</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">continued on in the way of their</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:26.000" style="s2">societies with respect to aesthetics so</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">from that those samplings of history</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.000" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">might we say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">trying to combine aesthetics with</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">revolution might not be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">yeah i mean obviously like the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">hitler example is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">um if you&#39;ve seen the movie max it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">about hitler as an art school student</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">and he makes very bad paintings that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">nobody likes um and then he</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">makes some paintings of the third reich</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">and his art teacher says this is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">most incredible work of art i&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s a really good movie because</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">it shows how aesthetics and politics can</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">get convoluted</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">and suddenly you have a horrific</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:02.400" style="s2">group of actual fascists right um but</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">you know like you can say that you like</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.400" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">uh you know like nancy uniforms or nazi</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">and be really against nazism um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">no reason you can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">like uh brutalist architecture it has</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">fascist connotations</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">um and then you have like the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">italian fascists they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">futurists first and the italian</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">futurists were</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">an art movement of people like us who</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">become the new proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s no room left on the left that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">how i like to put it</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">that sounds like that&#39;s a lot of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">reaction against the left which causes</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">you to use at least right terminology</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">that you don&#39;t believe there&#39;s room for</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:43.599" style="s2">real discourse on the left anymore</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">yeah yeah there&#39;s definitely not um and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.599" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">like like i said i&#39;m not like the right</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">winger or anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">um my idea um for the art rate is kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">of like to vanguard the alt-right into</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">something that is more about creation</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">self-expression</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">just being oneself and doing cool things</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">you know um and to do your own thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">you you might not be able to do that on</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">the left anymore so what what you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">is really brilliant people philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">scientists engineers that would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">been left</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">10 years ago um but now because the left</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">has become so elitist</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">and the right house has become the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">proletariat these people are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">like shoved into the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a disturbing phenomena you know um</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">because i grew up</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">pretty attached to the loft i believed</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">in human rights and i was</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">anti-censorship i was anti-globalization</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:36.560" style="s2">but now all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">apparently right-wing um</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">so who knows i mean these labels are are</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">so stupid and that&#39;s why the new art</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">write is about</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">just transcending that whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">subverting it and creating</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">uh a better a game b of my own you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:50.480" style="s2">yeah exactly i was going to say i think</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">game b person than as an alt-righter</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">just to be clear i was never an</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">all-writer</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">i was an alternative writer because i i</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">be associated with the all right at all</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">um and if</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.200" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">my own view is both fuck both the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">and the left neither of them struck me</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">what&#39;s useful and they&#39;re both turning</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">that she wanted to change the outright</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.760" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">into some</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">gothic horseshit i think that was like</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">the way they actually used</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">horseshit</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:27.280" style="s2">and that was what they thought that i</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">thought that the art rate was no like</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.280" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">the art rate is like five</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">by neo-nazis we&#39;re gonna do our own</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.599" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">you know because that&#39;s what we do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">yep i guess but i would i just my advice</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">i&#39;d say call us something besides the</p>

<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">because like nobody that knows me</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">ever thought of that um they could see</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">that it was actually like an overthrow</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">of the outright that it was like we were</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">looking to replace</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">translation of nietzsche into english in</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.839" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">1909 when he was like 19 years old</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s very clear that menken is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">kind of character but yeah there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.520" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">awful lot of interesting stuff in making</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">but on the other hand he has uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">you know a dark side too and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">i&#39;ve also read his diaries which were</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">released</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t know 20 years ago excerpts from</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">and wow they&#39;re very interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">it&#39;s also pretty damn clear</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">he was a pretty bad anti-semite that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">worth knowing as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">i actually i did not know that i&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">read notes on democracy</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">i just saw him as like an individual</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:57.040" style="s2">standard case i thought he was like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:48:59.920" style="s2">nietzschean like a sterner</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.040" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">type um he is mostly but he&#39;s a guy from</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.920" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">that era</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">from the south more or less baltimore</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">was sort of a southern town</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">and so he had that old boy anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">in a pretty nasty fashion</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">but he didn&#39;t seem to let it affect his</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">personal life his business partner was</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">jewish his publisher was jewish he got</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">along fine with jewish people but he</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">have an ugly anti-semitic streak in it</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">that he cannot be denied</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">but on the other hand he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:24.000" style="s2">interesting writer so i wouldn&#39;t i would</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:25.599" style="s2">say i&#39;m not going to cancel him i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.000" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">going to pull down his statue</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:29.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to get rid of my my h.l</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">menken library i&#39;m going to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.280" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">that he was</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">one of the more brilliant thinkers of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">the early part of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">but he had a flaw he was an anti-semite</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">yeah you want to throw the baby out with</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">circles um i&#39;ve actually attempted to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">dissect anti-semitism and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:53.359" style="s2">what it&#39;s about um you know and i i</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">would like to understand it and one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.359" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">the conclusions that i came to is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s about fear of the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">you know um also like a fear of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">this is a big one um a simple</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">distaste for people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">might not have like the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">um like level of kanji consciousness you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:16.240" style="s2">know what what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">there definitely seems to be like a a</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">bit of a hatred for the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">and um and then the other dissection i</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">made of anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">was that it was just um like the far</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">right scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">was the jews um but what they really</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.559" style="s2">meant was like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">global corporations doing trade that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.559" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">were like affecting</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">creatives is bad to them this is why the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">the nazis burnt</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">the books if they&#39;re more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">philosophers um and this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:27.520" style="s2">also why there was there the nazi purge</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">you know the night of the long knives</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.520" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">you know a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">um early nazis that were called</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">strasseris</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">you know they were considered to be like</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">a degenerate because they were gay and</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">creative um so most people don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:41.599" style="s2">know that they think there&#39;s like only</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:43.599" style="s2">one nazi party</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.599" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know that there was</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:48.240" style="s2">actually like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:50.559" style="s2">split and that the um more</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.240" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">creative nazis got got killed you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.559" end="00:54:54.079" style="s2">during during that historical night</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">um but of course i wasn&#39;t there you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.079" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">in history</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">you know we have the the news um and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">news is just like a d</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:02.720" style="s2">based version of history so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:05.680" style="s2">know what really happened um</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.720" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">but what what i will say is that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.680" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">should always question everything that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:10.559" style="s2">we&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:12.160" style="s2">and form our own conclusions yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">a that&#39;s always a good idea i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">you know you mentioned the strassers you</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">know people don&#39;t as you said most</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">people don&#39;t know about that ancient</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">history but</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:21.119" style="s2">you know nazi was national socialist</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">there actually were socialists</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.119" end="00:55:25.119" style="s2">in the national socialists and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">strasser brothers were more or less the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.119" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">leaders of that faction and that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.119" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">another reason they were kicked out and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">i think one of them was killed in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">night of the long knives so</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:36.559" style="s2">a lot of oddities in the in that history</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">so basically you&#39;re you come out in</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.559" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">favor of cosmopolitan again i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:41.280" style="s2">that&#39;s uh not very compatible with</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:43.839" style="s2">today&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.280" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">right wing to say the least right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.839" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">and again</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">this is why i&#39;m using the turmeric right</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:49.680" style="s2">because i&#39;m saying you guys are doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.680" end="00:55:53.200" style="s2">that i am not interested but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">interested in doing is</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">over here you know got it</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">so the final essay i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">actually an appendix or something</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">which more or less summed up where you</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">were coming from it was called</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">toward a dark bohemia tell us about that</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.920" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">like a materialist prison</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">right so um while we do need reason you</p>

<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:10.839" style="s2">what we don&#39;t need is reason turning</p>

<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not gonna deny that um but i i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">it is important to understand how reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">um and utilitarianism and i know</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">spangler talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">about this um are are being used to kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">of like take the the soul</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:28.880" style="s2">out of people and turn them into like</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">these these non-player</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.880" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">characters and i think that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:35.280" style="s2">fight that by creating a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">resurrection of philosophy yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a that is a good vision you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">it does oftentimes feel like game a is a</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">exists kind of seems to exist almost</p>

<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">the the behemoth itself and if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.559" end="00:59:00.240" style="s2">started to think about what does a</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:03.760" style="s2">society look at look like where</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.240" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">these kinds of uh aesthetic and personal</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:07.760" style="s2">uh particularly in my mind convivial the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">idea of</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.760" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">you know celebration with other people</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">face to face</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">in song and dance and drink and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">some other crazy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">right that made that central to our</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:19.200" style="s2">society rather than money on money</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:20.799" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.200" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">would be heading towards on a better</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.799" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">road for sure i would like to see that</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t think money is the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">a lot of people on the left</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:30.559" style="s2">do i&#39;m a lot of these anti-capitalists</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">are kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.559" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand that the core</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:38.000" style="s2">issue is the utilitarian</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:39.520" style="s2">lack of interest in things that really</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.000" end="00:59:41.760" style="s2">blow people&#39;s minds</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.520" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">um it&#39;s more of like an interest in just</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.760" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">like sticking to</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:46.880" style="s2">what they consider to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">efficient</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.880" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">thing but they&#39;re what they do when they</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:51.920" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:53.680" style="s2">is they lock out new possibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">they actually become less efficient</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.680" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">as a result because they cut out</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">anything in the margins</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">you know that might like temporarily</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.359" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:06.799" style="s2">a bit too much entropy but if all</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is waiting out entropy</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:10.079" style="s2">you know then they&#39;re basically weeding</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:13.200" style="s2">out growth</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.079" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that entropy is good but</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:17.760" style="s2">entropy is real</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:20.160" style="s2">entropy exists and maybe instead of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.760" end="01:00:20.799" style="s2">weeding out entropy we should find out</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">how to</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.799" end="01:00:25.520" style="s2">to scale it properly um i have a model i</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">call it scaling volatility where if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.520" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">volatility positively then you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">vitality</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:32.559" style="s2">um but if you schedule utility</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:34.559" style="s2">negatively and then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.559" end="01:00:36.400" style="s2">have decline um it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.559" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">understand that entropy is a force that</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.400" end="01:00:40.799" style="s2">you don&#39;t just have to run away from</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">you can learn the edges of it you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.799" end="01:00:43.760" style="s2">explore entropy and like figure out the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">way to make it work</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.760" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">best for you but unfortunately the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">majority of people are just like oh no</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">entropy and then they think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:50.640" style="s2">like making progress when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:53.680" style="s2">actually like</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.640" end="01:00:55.520" style="s2">holding back the evolution of um the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.680" end="01:00:59.040" style="s2">species and of civilization</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">got it that&#39;s an interesting vision uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.040" end="01:01:02.640" style="s2">let&#39;s see what else we got here a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">things left to go you&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.640" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">from time to time</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:08.319" style="s2">about anarchy what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">on anarchy as an alternative</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.319" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">well i always considered myself an</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">anarchist because i didn&#39;t believe in an</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:16.079" style="s2">authoritarian role and i believed in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">sovereignty of the individual</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.079" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">um but you know a lot of anarchists</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">they&#39;ve called me some not nice names um</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:27.520" style="s2">i found myself more like on the sterner</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">you know individualist anarchist side of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.520" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">things um i remember taking a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">flack because i</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">i worked for an anti-ipc anarchist site</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">called attack the system</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">you know which i mean i i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:41.280" style="s2">know if i would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">an anarchist like according to like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.280" end="01:01:45.359" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">of what anarchy means now um</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.359" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">romeo is always about self-sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">so you know people are like oh seared</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:53.359" style="s2">libertarian um</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:55.359" style="s2">i&#39;ve made the joke that a libertarian is</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">just an anarchist that gets</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.359" end="01:02:01.680" style="s2">wise to success so um</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:05.039" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s how i feel about that</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.680" end="01:02:07.280" style="s2">all righty now as a strong woman who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">about sexual adventures that people have</p>
