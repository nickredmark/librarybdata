<p begin="00:00:06.020" end="00:00:14.549" style="s2">okay Daniel I&#39;m gonna let you or ask you</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.349" end="00:00:17.430" style="s2">introduce yourself and just give you a</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.549" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">little quick summary about your history</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:27.390" style="s2">and and then let you get started okay we</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">just change this view again there we go</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.390" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">right and well thank you everybody for</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">making time for this webinar and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">Who am I I have been well basically I</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:49.140" style="s2">started off as a biologist and was</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.789" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">studying marine mammals and at some</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.140" end="00:00:53.190" style="s2">point realized that if I continued to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">study marine mammals my grandchildren</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.190" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">were probably only know of them from</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">picture books because they would go</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:03.570" style="s2">extinct and so I decided to pay</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:07.159" style="s2">attention to my own species but mainly</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">because I like marine mammals and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.159" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">that then took me to studying at Omaha</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.460" end="00:01:16.350" style="s2">College doing a master&#39;s in holistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">science and later a PhD in design for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.350" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">sustainability it was called design for</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:23.909" style="s2">human and Planetary health a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">integral approach to complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.909" end="00:01:30.680" style="s2">sustainability like a good PhD should</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">have a big chunky name and it was also</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.680" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">750 page thesis nobody wanted to read</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">and that was in 2006 and since then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:43.049" style="s2">been trying to explore what all that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">thinking and all that research that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.049" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">did for my PhD and for my masters would</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">actually look like in practice so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">spent some time working with the Eco</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">village movement lived at the Finland</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">eco village ramp in college to build</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">bridges between universities and eco</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">villages as applied field study sites</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">for applied sustainability and work with</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">pioneers brought Bioneers to Europe</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:11.880" style="s2">and got invited to join the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:18.390" style="s2">international futures forum which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.880" end="00:02:21.240" style="s2">group of mainly at the time it was all</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.390" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">the consultants who&#39;d already had their</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.240" end="00:02:26.520" style="s2">career and really wanted to share the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">tools of their career with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.520" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">they sort of realized that they needed</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:33.420" style="s2">to bring in some fresh thinking and some</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">some younger ones and I was lucky enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">to be part of that and yeah so basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">in 2016 I published a book which I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:49.020" style="s2">lying here yeah designing regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">cultures and since then I&#39;ve started to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.020" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">work with social media and putting my</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:57.330" style="s2">writing online and not just my book but</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">also also the earlier writing and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.330" end="00:03:03.660" style="s2">really that&#39;s in the work that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:05.880" style="s2">created a visibility that that now</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.660" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">people are interested in having</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.880" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">conversations with me they could have</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:10.380" style="s2">had them ten years earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">unfortunately I didn&#39;t share the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.380" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">information so I&#39;m really glad to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">this webinar because it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:22.950" style="s2">opportunity to share some thinking with</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:26.330" style="s2">you and I would like to highlight from</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.950" end="00:03:28.590" style="s2">the beginning from the start that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.330" end="00:03:31.019" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna talk for about four to five</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.590" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">minutes and really I would love your</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.019" end="00:03:36.900" style="s2">feedback on this this is work in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">progress this is not the gospel and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.900" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">don&#39;t need to believe it I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">talking about what I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:45.590" style="s2">this issue and then I would love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.410" end="00:03:48.750" style="s2">your experience because I know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.590" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">Deanna has a link to the International</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.750" end="00:03:53.400" style="s2">Society of System science and and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:56.040" style="s2">sure that some of the people on the call</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">will be more expert in all this than I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.040" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">am</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.430" end="00:04:07.019" style="s2">let me just try again whether I can do</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">this screen share properly should remind</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.019" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">everybody in those that joined be sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">and put in the chat where you&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">and any references you want to share</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">with us about your work and then any</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:22.370" style="s2">questions you might have for Daniel you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">can put in there as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.370" end="00:04:29.790" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get rid of this little</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">window here I think your will not see</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.790" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">the window of all the people just on</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:41.220" style="s2">mine okay good well let&#39;s get started um</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:42.810" style="s2">I also have to say that because I this</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.220" end="00:04:45.180" style="s2">morning I thought no I don&#39;t want to use</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.810" end="00:04:46.740" style="s2">a presentation that I&#39;ve used before and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.180" end="00:04:49.500" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been building this presentation</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.740" end="00:04:54.150" style="s2">mentally all day between taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.500" end="00:04:57.150" style="s2">my 20 month old daughter and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.150" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">quite finished so it&#39;s it&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.150" end="00:05:06.630" style="s2">um so I&#39;d like to start by repeating</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">that anything that is said is said by an</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.630" end="00:05:14.310" style="s2">observers from Adana pointed out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:17.820" style="s2">therefore every observation has a blind</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.310" end="00:05:19.890" style="s2">spot but I also want to point out which</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.820" end="00:05:22.020" style="s2">is what I learned from one of my mentors</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.890" end="00:05:24.420" style="s2">at Omaha College Brian Goodwin that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.020" end="00:05:27.170" style="s2">really you can&#39;t be an observer you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.420" end="00:05:29.370" style="s2">always a participant you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.170" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">subjectively involved in the system</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.370" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with and really with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:36.180" style="s2">title of moving into systems practice I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">think that is at the core of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.180" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">trying to explore today what it means</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:46.050" style="s2">the handle has a Systems practitioner to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:48.420" style="s2">understand there are multiple ways of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.050" end="00:05:52.040" style="s2">knowing and they all can inform how we</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.420" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">participate in a system and that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.040" end="00:05:59.160" style="s2">really are both the results of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:05.730" style="s2">emerging complex dynamic system in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.160" end="00:06:08.070" style="s2">we participate people with properties if</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.730" end="00:06:13.110" style="s2">you all mute your mic then we won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.070" end="00:06:17.160" style="s2">the noise in the background but we also</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.110" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">basically all co-creative participants</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.160" end="00:06:21.090" style="s2">of the system which means that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:23.910" style="s2">everything we do every day all the time</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.090" end="00:06:26.640" style="s2">shapes the future of the world and for</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.910" end="00:06:28.160" style="s2">me that is really crucial at this point</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.640" end="00:06:31.490" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:34.430" style="s2">we are facing as gem Mandel calls it a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.490" end="00:06:37.670" style="s2">new term human extinction the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.430" end="00:06:39.860" style="s2">possibility that if we don&#39;t make more</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.670" end="00:06:42.380" style="s2">appropriate choices about how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.860" end="00:06:45.890" style="s2">participate in the biosphere as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.380" end="00:06:49.100" style="s2">complex dynamic system that we might not</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.890" end="00:06:51.860" style="s2">be around in the 24 22nd century or only</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.100" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">very few of us is is real and present</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.860" end="00:06:55.760" style="s2">and we have young children going into</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:59.740" style="s2">the streets and telling the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.760" end="00:07:03.260" style="s2">leaders it&#39;s time to act upon this so</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.740" end="00:07:06.530" style="s2">while a lot of what I will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.260" end="00:07:11.000" style="s2">today might seem at a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.530" end="00:07:13.970" style="s2">kind of theory I think that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.000" end="00:07:15.910" style="s2">false dualism that we often work with</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.970" end="00:07:19.550" style="s2">the dualism between theory and practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.910" end="00:07:21.410" style="s2">the the meta design that the changes</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.550" end="00:07:23.570" style="s2">worldviews and value system is really</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.410" end="00:07:25.970" style="s2">the app stream end of the crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.570" end="00:07:27.920" style="s2">that we face and so if you if you change</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.970" end="00:07:32.510" style="s2">world gears and value systems you change</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.920" end="00:07:35.780" style="s2">everything downstream and but but all</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.510" end="00:07:38.420" style="s2">this theoretical framework that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.780" end="00:07:41.150" style="s2">explore today is really in the context</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.420" end="00:07:43.550" style="s2">of a very practical and urgent crisis on</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.150" end="00:07:45.560" style="s2">the planet of how do we respond to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.550" end="00:07:51.670" style="s2">climate change how to respond to these</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.560" end="00:07:51.670" style="s2">converging crises that were facing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.320" end="00:08:00.980" style="s2">basically for me learning from Brian</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.980" end="00:08:07.820" style="s2">insight that I got from Brian was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.350" end="00:08:13.820" style="s2">science was now at a point where it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.820" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">understanding that we then we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.820" end="00:08:19.070" style="s2">predict and control a system beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:21.560" style="s2">very limited boundary of of a system and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.070" end="00:08:24.950" style="s2">that because we are always participants</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.560" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">the whole aim of science had to shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.950" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">from increased manipulation increased</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.780" style="s2">control and prediction which is really</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:34.750" style="s2">the agenda of the science scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.780" end="00:08:38.660" style="s2">activity since the Scientific Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.750" end="00:08:40.520" style="s2">to understanding our role within this</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.660" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">complex dynamic system and how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.520" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">participate appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">and that in that is a shift from assigns</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:54.410" style="s2">of that is mainly caring about</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:58.430" style="s2">quantities and immeasurable to a science</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.410" end="00:09:03.980" style="s2">of qualities that shouldn&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.430" end="00:09:07.399" style="s2">necessarily into the trap of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.980" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">measure quantity measure qualities</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.399" end="00:09:12.050" style="s2">because the minute you you try to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:18.769" style="s2">quantify qualities you lose something</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.050" end="00:09:21.980" style="s2">that is really important and so another</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.769" end="00:09:41.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of talk about paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.060" end="00:09:44.990" style="s2">shifting and I really like pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.540" end="00:09:49.070" style="s2">that there are two versions of Donella</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.990" end="00:09:50.930" style="s2">Meadows famous article on leverage</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.120" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">very much that kind of modeling system</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.930" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">have the highest leverage point and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.870" end="00:10:44.930" style="s2">a later version of that same paper is</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:47.570" style="s2">available that&#39;s where she added another</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.930" end="00:10:50.600" style="s2">layer which is the the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.570" end="00:10:53.390" style="s2">transcend paradigms the ability to not</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:09.769" style="s2">extent I will make will be making the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.029" end="00:11:12.410" style="s2">same mistake when I say that we need a</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.410" end="00:11:17.089" style="s2">mean that that means leaving behind a</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:19.610" style="s2">turned into her latest book which is how</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.959" end="00:12:23.930" style="s2">much you remember the title so sometimes</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">really just wanted to drop this in for</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.060" end="00:13:27.770" style="s2">for this kind of audience and assuming</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:29.630" style="s2">that you&#39;re all sort of interested in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.770" end="00:13:31.730" style="s2">systems thinking that these three papers</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.630" end="00:13:34.010" style="s2">are really worth taking another look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.730" end="00:13:38.210" style="s2">and particularly the dancing word</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.010" end="00:13:41.840" style="s2">systems one and another piece of work</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.210" end="00:13:44.810" style="s2">that in this context I should mention is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.840" end="00:13:46.640" style="s2">Katya Laszlo&#39;s work where she says that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.810" end="00:13:49.100" style="s2">we really need to move beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.640" end="00:13:51.860" style="s2">systems thinking to system&#39;s feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.100" end="00:13:54.530" style="s2">systems being and which again says that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.860" end="00:13:57.410" style="s2">the same thing on the one hand says we</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.530" end="00:14:02.420" style="s2">in the system were not externalized</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.410" end="00:14:03.980" style="s2">observers and it begins to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.420" end="00:14:07.070" style="s2">that there are other ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.980" end="00:14:10.540" style="s2">that are important that are not just in</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.070" end="00:14:13.430" style="s2">analytical analysis of theta because um</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.540" end="00:14:14.090" style="s2">coming back terrific to so the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.430" end="00:14:17.390" style="s2">were facing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.090" end="00:14:19.970" style="s2">like I haven&#39;t Baron who we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.390" end="00:14:22.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know what just interact with him</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.970" end="00:14:26.960" style="s2">on Facebook you recently put it</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.820" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">beautifully but by saying that um we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.960" end="00:14:34.520" style="s2">now at a situation in in the world where</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:39.740" style="s2">if we just look at the data if we like</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.520" end="00:14:41.690" style="s2">like what we&#39;re facing is well we now</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.740" end="00:14:44.150" style="s2">have to do like what Kevin said is we</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.690" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">now have to do the impossible because</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.150" end="00:14:49.670" style="s2">the likely is unthinkable and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:54.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a powerful way of framing where</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.670" end="00:14:57.290" style="s2">we are and if we just look at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.250" end="00:15:00.140" style="s2">quantitative scientific data that comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.290" end="00:15:03.170" style="s2">from the IPCC and and all the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.140" end="00:15:05.480" style="s2">points in the climate system and and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.170" end="00:15:10.670" style="s2">just look at the data of where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.480" end="00:15:13.370" style="s2">with increased ideological separation in</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.670" end="00:15:16.490" style="s2">the world with with the strongmen coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.370" end="00:15:20.300" style="s2">back in in many countries with the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.490" end="00:15:21.620" style="s2">evil monster fascism raising its its its</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.300" end="00:15:25.330" style="s2">ugly head again</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.620" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">that we thought we long got beyond then</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.330" end="00:15:29.510" style="s2">we could easily despair and say this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:33.560" style="s2">this isn&#39;t going anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.510" end="00:15:36.350" style="s2">so so really we have to almost trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.560" end="00:15:39.920" style="s2">that there is something deeper that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.350" end="00:15:42.350" style="s2">about a transformation of our entire</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:46.300" style="s2">being and consciousness state that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.350" end="00:15:49.180" style="s2">because we&#39;re all part of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.300" end="00:15:52.340" style="s2">co-creators of the system if we change</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.180" end="00:15:54.380" style="s2">individually we actually in effect the</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.380" end="00:15:59.030" style="s2">if enough of us engage in that process</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.870" end="00:16:01.760" style="s2">then we might just still have a chance</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.030" end="00:16:04.130" style="s2">to to work that miracle that we now need</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.470" end="00:16:19.370" style="s2">that&#39;s again that qualitative ability to</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.950" end="00:16:32.960" style="s2">and intellectualizing about it and and</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.450" end="00:18:59.640" style="s2">that again may be a reminder for people</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.510" end="00:19:03.420" style="s2">to Mike because I hear people&#39;s health</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.640" end="00:19:05.820" style="s2">phones and coffee cups and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.420" end="00:19:09.870" style="s2">another person to highlight and in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.820" end="00:19:11.460" style="s2">context is Laura Bateson who I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.870" end="00:19:14.280" style="s2">with this whole conversation that she</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.460" end="00:19:16.260" style="s2">now started and the warm data labs that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.280" end="00:19:18.390" style="s2">she&#39;s running the conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.260" end="00:19:22.910" style="s2">what is warm data she&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.390" end="00:19:25.320" style="s2">addressing these same issues um you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.910" end="00:19:28.100" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of I can&#39;t really see my own</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.320" end="00:19:30.450" style="s2">slides because of this well let me just</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.100" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">figure out how I get rid of this bar</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.450" end="00:19:35.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s starting to irritate me and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:43.260" style="s2">no that&#39;s not what I wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.880" end="00:19:50.250" style="s2">and how do I get there ah okay great</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.260" end="00:19:53.750" style="s2">so um yeah I guess the main point that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.250" end="00:19:57.240" style="s2">wanted to make is Laura&#39;s is another</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.750" end="00:20:00.360" style="s2">great source of people for people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.240" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">want to go deeper into this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.360" end="00:20:07.740" style="s2">around how do we value new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:12.840" style="s2">knowing or ancient forms of knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.740" end="00:20:15.030" style="s2">how do we value different ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.840" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">an approach being in and approaching the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.030" end="00:20:25.620" style="s2">world and also the minute we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:31.220" style="s2">pay that much attention to just the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.620" end="00:20:34.110" style="s2">intellectual analytical then we also can</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.220" end="00:20:36.210" style="s2">give more value to multiple ways of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.110" end="00:20:37.860" style="s2">knowing and different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.210" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">because really the complexity we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.860" end="00:20:44.520" style="s2">facing is now so drastic that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:46.740" style="s2">impossible to have just one way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.520" end="00:20:49.169" style="s2">knowing and to inform us about it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.740" end="00:20:56.220" style="s2">I&#39;m still stuck with this sorry about</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.169" end="00:21:02.090" style="s2">this what&#39;s going on here anyway</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.220" end="00:21:08.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve got no know my screen is stuck okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.090" end="00:21:08.390" style="s2">no sorry about this what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.559" end="00:21:22.940" style="s2">basically I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.970" end="00:21:38.350" style="s2">the screen where I see your faces down</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.940" end="00:21:41.289" style="s2">to the show okay so right so yeah again</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.350" end="00:21:46.010" style="s2">highlighting this this overall shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.289" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">into what does it mean to radically</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:53.780" style="s2">accept participation as a notion that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:56.840" style="s2">gives us on the one hand an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.780" end="00:22:00.110" style="s2">amount of responsibility because every</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.840" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">action that we engage in does affect the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.110" end="00:22:05.539" style="s2">whole system and does change the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s a wonderful example to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.539" end="00:22:13.340" style="s2">look at this this 16 year old Swedish</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">girl greater turn Berg as an example of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.340" end="00:22:20.059" style="s2">that it is actually possible for one</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:26.870" style="s2">individual to make a global impact and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.059" end="00:22:30.530" style="s2">it starts with a seemingly quixotic or</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.870" end="00:22:32.630" style="s2">Don Quijote type action of thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.530" end="00:22:36.110" style="s2">that by sitting in front of a parliament</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.630" end="00:22:38.179" style="s2">and in Stockholm and this one little</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.110" end="00:22:42.110" style="s2">girl could start a global movement and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.179" end="00:22:45.340" style="s2">she did and so it&#39;s it&#39;s I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.110" end="00:22:51.060" style="s2">all called now to understand that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.340" end="00:22:54.760" style="s2">have to become actors in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.060" end="00:22:57.040" style="s2">last act of civilizational importance of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.760" end="00:22:58.840" style="s2">the end of in the of the era of Empires</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.040" end="00:23:01.030" style="s2">in the beginning of the planetary era</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.840" end="00:23:03.880" style="s2">and if we want to make this transition</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.030" end="00:23:08.160" style="s2">from the era of empires from the era of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.880" end="00:23:10.990" style="s2">power over to the era of power with as</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.160" end="00:23:13.390" style="s2">mature members of the community of life</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.990" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">again rather than an immature species</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.390" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">that thinks it can exploit the planetary</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:25.420" style="s2">system it depends upon at infinitum then</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">we we really need to step from this not</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.420" end="00:23:31.210" style="s2">just from ego to eco but really to step</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:34.360" style="s2">into service and and ask this question</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.210" end="00:23:36.130" style="s2">of what would it be like to participate</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.360" end="00:23:37.720" style="s2">appropriately in the system and really</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.130" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s for me what designing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.720" end="00:23:42.790" style="s2">regenerative cultures is all about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:46.600" style="s2">it&#39;s about how do we engage with our</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.790" end="00:23:50.530" style="s2">communities in place and to make our</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.600" end="00:23:53.850" style="s2">present a presence as human beings in</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.530" end="00:23:57.370" style="s2">our local bio region or on the planet a</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.380" end="00:24:14.620" style="s2">useful in understanding how we make</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.980" end="00:24:16.990" style="s2">mistakes when we when we begin to think</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.620" end="00:24:19.240" style="s2">in this way that we&#39;re all co-creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.990" end="00:24:23.350" style="s2">this complex dynamic system wherein is</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:03.400" style="s2">but was to observe how these</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.130" end="00:25:05.950" style="s2">transdisciplinary teams of scientists um</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.400" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">different like Economist&#39;s and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.950" end="00:25:12.730" style="s2">biologists and very very diverse group</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:17.380" style="s2">were interacting and responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.730" end="00:25:19.390" style="s2">changes that they had decided and so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.380" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">can see that like the these main</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.390" end="00:25:24.160" style="s2">mistakes that he pointed out are</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:29.470" style="s2">basically the ones that we constantly</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.160" end="00:25:33.580" style="s2">face when we look at getting things</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.470" end="00:25:37.150" style="s2">wrong basically we define the the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.580" end="00:25:39.429" style="s2">goals and we have not enough of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.150" end="00:25:42.340" style="s2">systems analysis that really understands</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.429" end="00:25:43.950" style="s2">nested whole logic systems and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.340" end="00:25:46.179" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pay enough attention to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.950" end="00:25:51.309" style="s2">side-effects and then when we react we</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.309" end="00:25:55.390" style="s2">than dancing with the system we try to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.020" end="00:25:57.970" style="s2">force the system into into new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.390" end="00:25:59.860" style="s2">doing things and one thing that I also</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.970" end="00:26:03.760" style="s2">noticed in the work of my book is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.860" end="00:26:06.820" style="s2">these kind of lists of common mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.760" end="00:26:10.150" style="s2">or principles and they they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.820" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">often they stay very intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.150" end="00:26:17.650" style="s2">very I tell you to if you list them in</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:19.570" style="s2">this wave so what I fix explored in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.650" end="00:26:22.600" style="s2">book in quite some detail is the power</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.570" end="00:26:24.900" style="s2">of turning these principles and these</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.600" end="00:26:28.200" style="s2">these guidelines into questions and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.900" end="00:26:32.590" style="s2">these are basically the same points that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.200" end="00:26:36.309" style="s2">Turner discovered and bother the last</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.590" end="00:26:38.200" style="s2">one which I added but by turning them</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.309" end="00:26:39.940" style="s2">into questions there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.200" end="00:26:41.800" style="s2">powerful that happens because if I tell</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.940" end="00:26:43.570" style="s2">you a set of principles to follow</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.800" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">I&#39;m basically telling you I&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.570" end="00:26:47.500" style="s2">work believe me I know what what needs</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:50.200" style="s2">to be done just follow the principles</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.500" end="00:26:52.630" style="s2">and all will be fine but if I turn it</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.200" end="00:26:54.760" style="s2">into a set of questions then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.630" end="00:26:56.710" style="s2">an engagement then it becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.760" end="00:26:58.840" style="s2">invitation to create collective</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.710" end="00:27:01.480" style="s2">intelligence because I&#39;m actually asking</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.840" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">the audience or asking the core</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.480" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">participants and what they think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:10.029" style="s2">these questions and and it also means</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:13.629" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.029" end="00:27:16.330" style="s2">everything becomes much more attuned to</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.629" end="00:27:19.239" style="s2">the community and the place that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.330" end="00:27:22.119" style="s2">question is asked in so it becomes play</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.239" end="00:27:24.629" style="s2">specific and culture specific and for me</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.119" end="00:27:29.950" style="s2">that that is like if I if I give you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.629" end="00:27:31.749" style="s2">nutshell definition of what designing</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.950" end="00:27:34.659" style="s2">regenerative cultures is all about for</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.749" end="00:27:37.359" style="s2">me it&#39;s about co-creating elegant</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.659" end="00:27:39.879" style="s2">solutions that are carefully adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.359" end="00:27:42.460" style="s2">the bio cultural uniqueness of place and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.879" end="00:27:45.849" style="s2">this bio cultural uniqueness of place</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.460" end="00:27:48.759" style="s2">that that we can&#39;t find solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.849" end="00:27:50.619" style="s2">are global we can share best practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.759" end="00:27:52.869" style="s2">and best processes we can share what</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.619" end="00:27:55.359" style="s2">works in one place but we and and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.869" end="00:27:57.700" style="s2">then explore in a questioning way</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.359" end="00:28:00.429" style="s2">whether it might also be appropriate in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.700" end="00:28:04.119" style="s2">another place but we can&#39;t cut and paste</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.429" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">some solutions and in a similar way this</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.119" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">this economic knee-jerk response of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:12.519" style="s2">do we scale it up might be inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:14.649" style="s2">because when solutions get scaled up</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.519" end="00:28:19.239" style="s2">they often become problems rather than</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.649" end="00:28:23.309" style="s2">solutions maybe it&#39;s about scaling out</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.239" end="00:28:27.309" style="s2">and or reaching scale by spreading</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.309" end="00:28:30.849" style="s2">meaning that these appropriate patterns</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.309" end="00:28:33.639" style="s2">of participation happen at the local or</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.849" end="00:28:36.969" style="s2">by a regional level in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.639" end="00:28:38.469" style="s2">depending on the uniqueness of the local</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.969" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">ecosystem and the uniqueness of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.469" end="00:28:47.559" style="s2">local culture and another reflection</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:50.409" style="s2">years is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.559" end="00:28:54.009" style="s2">title of designing regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.409" end="00:28:57.100" style="s2">is a paradox and it&#39;s to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.009" end="00:29:01.480" style="s2">paradox of emergence and design that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:03.879" style="s2">really and cultures they they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.480" end="00:29:05.769" style="s2">designed they emerge they emerge through</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.879" end="00:29:08.169" style="s2">the interactions and the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.769" end="00:29:11.049" style="s2">through all those qualitative nuances</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.169" end="00:29:15.460" style="s2">that that we tend to not pay enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.049" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">attention to in in a true quantity</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.460" end="00:29:23.470" style="s2">focused science analytical science but</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:27.100" style="s2">at the same time we do need to face the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.470" end="00:29:31.889" style="s2">future with some form of action and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.100" end="00:29:34.450" style="s2">our intentions of how to participate and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.889" end="00:29:36.369" style="s2">the interactions and relationships we</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.369" end="00:29:42.429" style="s2">really do matter but it&#39;s this it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.450" end="00:29:44.019" style="s2">dance like for me that is really the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.429" end="00:29:45.879" style="s2">core of what I would like to have our</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.019" end="00:29:49.450" style="s2">conversation or questions and answers</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.879" end="00:29:51.940" style="s2">afterwards on is this how do we design</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.450" end="00:29:54.159" style="s2">for positive emergence what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.940" end="00:29:56.529" style="s2">do when you&#39;re on the one hand fully</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.159" end="00:29:59.529" style="s2">embrace uncertainty and unpredictability</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.529" end="00:30:02.379" style="s2">and uncontrollability of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.529" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">were in because you actually include</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.379" end="00:30:07.529" style="s2">everybody and you include the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">complexity of not just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.529" end="00:30:12.249" style="s2">leverage change with the usual suspects</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:14.200" style="s2">that are already agreeing with you but</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.249" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">you&#39;re actually trying to work at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.200" end="00:30:19.330" style="s2">bioregional scale with everybody in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">bio region in the context of the global</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.330" end="00:30:25.899" style="s2">situation and so you you really have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:26.950" style="s2">deal with the fact that there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.899" end="00:30:30.369" style="s2">people that see the world very</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.950" end="00:30:36.669" style="s2">differently and for me that&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.369" end="00:30:38.139" style="s2">inquiry how to do that well and as you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.669" end="00:30:43.049" style="s2">can see it&#39;s a blank slide which has</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.139" end="00:30:43.049" style="s2">then finish it em another</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.630" end="00:30:48.790" style="s2">of questions that that are basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.410" end="00:30:51.700" style="s2">there were guidelines but I turned them</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.790" end="00:30:54.490" style="s2">into questions then that might help in</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.700" end="00:30:56.380" style="s2">this context is what my colleagues from</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.490" end="00:30:58.210" style="s2">the IFF Graeme Lester and Maureen O&#39;Hara</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.380" end="00:31:00.220" style="s2">put together in a wonderful little book</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.210" end="00:31:04.120" style="s2">which is called 10 things to do in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.220" end="00:31:06.730" style="s2">conceptual emergency and and again all</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.120" end="00:31:09.460" style="s2">of these questions point towards that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.730" end="00:31:11.680" style="s2">the same kind of qualitative issues and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.460" end="00:31:14.280" style="s2">the same issues that also Nora Bateson</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.680" end="00:31:17.800" style="s2">addresses with warm data like these</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.800" end="00:31:29.050" style="s2">intervention points are that that might</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.170" end="00:31:31.060" style="s2">flip a system with a relatively small</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.060" end="00:31:41.320" style="s2">being and how to work with the system</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.440" end="00:31:46.090" style="s2">when you&#39;re acknowledging that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.320" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">actually control it and did to some</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.950" end="00:32:03.220" style="s2">is very abstract to some extent just to</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.700" end="00:32:31.660" style="s2">was already involved in the process of</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.010" end="00:32:58.930" style="s2">in September 2015 we set about creating</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.930" end="00:33:08.560" style="s2">local level and I ended up with with</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.350" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">that the idea was to just create a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.560" end="00:33:15.340" style="s2">one-day workshop and I really used this</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:16.810" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller quote of if you want</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.340" end="00:33:18.910" style="s2">to teach people a new way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.810" end="00:33:21.100" style="s2">don&#39;t bother trying to teach them</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.910" end="00:33:23.410" style="s2">instead give them a tool the use of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.100" end="00:33:26.940" style="s2">which will lead to a new way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.410" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">as my my sort of guiding principle and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.940" end="00:33:33.400" style="s2">what I came up with is this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:37.060" style="s2">these SDG flashcards that when they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.400" end="00:33:39.190" style="s2">finished I I sold it like it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.060" end="00:33:43.930" style="s2">really still the the better version that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.190" end="00:33:46.420" style="s2">that was sent to the two UNESCO our</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.930" end="00:33:48.760" style="s2">partner in in the UN and they really</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.420" end="00:33:51.490" style="s2">liked what they saw and and very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.760" end="00:33:53.980" style="s2">before we even had enough time to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.490" end="00:33:56.980" style="s2">correct the what I would call the better</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.980" end="00:34:00.250" style="s2">version these cards were then translated</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.980" end="00:34:03.880" style="s2">into Spanish French Portuguese Arabic</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.250" end="00:34:06.160" style="s2">Russians and Chinese and basically these</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.880" end="00:34:08.040" style="s2">cards are structured in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.160" end="00:34:10.880" style="s2">that all of Gaia education</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.040" end="00:34:12.419" style="s2">curriculums as structured and we take a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.880" end="00:34:14.640" style="s2">four-dimensional approach to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.419" end="00:34:17.340" style="s2">sustainability so it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.640" end="00:34:20.460" style="s2">classic social economic and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.340" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">but it includes worldview as an</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.460" end="00:34:25.110" style="s2">important fourth dimension and you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:28.169" style="s2">call worldview culture you could call</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.110" end="00:34:29.730" style="s2">worldview spirituality the bring sniff</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.169" end="00:34:31.370" style="s2">brings up different responses in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.730" end="00:34:35.870" style="s2">different people but it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.370" end="00:34:38.100" style="s2">acknowledging that this second-order</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.870" end="00:34:42.360" style="s2">observation of how do I think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.100" end="00:34:43.950" style="s2">things actually affects how I act in all</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.360" end="00:34:48.660" style="s2">the other dimensions and is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.950" end="00:34:51.690" style="s2">crucial and so each of these each of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.660" end="00:34:54.440" style="s2">17s DG&#39;s is approached through three</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.690" end="00:34:57.420" style="s2">cards which the cards actually help a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.440" end="00:35:00.510" style="s2">group process of living questions in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.420" end="00:35:03.090" style="s2">place about how are the SDG is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.510" end="00:35:04.890" style="s2">to this place what is already happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.090" end="00:35:07.080" style="s2">in this place that might help implement</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.890" end="00:35:10.890" style="s2">this particular SDG and what could we do</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.080" end="00:35:12.990" style="s2">to make it to co-create a relevant</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.890" end="00:35:16.110" style="s2">implementation project about this SDG</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.990" end="00:35:18.570" style="s2">and then also cross-referencing to other</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.110" end="00:35:20.340" style="s2">SD G&#39;s in such a way that it guides</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.570" end="00:35:22.980" style="s2">people into a much more systemic</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.340" end="00:35:24.600" style="s2">understanding not just by thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.980" end="00:35:27.720" style="s2">each of the seventeen from four</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.600" end="00:35:30.810" style="s2">different dimensions but also thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.720" end="00:35:33.420" style="s2">about how how to link them all up and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.810" end="00:35:35.730" style="s2">create projects that that implement not</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.420" end="00:35:38.760" style="s2">just one or two but but all 17 at once</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.730" end="00:35:41.310" style="s2">ideally and so these cards come together</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.760" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">with a one day workshop process which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.310" end="00:35:46.770" style="s2">called the training of multipliers and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:48.660" style="s2">and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.770" end="00:35:50.910" style="s2">tools that that are used in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.660" end="00:35:54.030" style="s2">workshop not just the cards one of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.910" end="00:35:56.430" style="s2">is this idea that that I just used the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.030" end="00:35:57.930" style="s2">basic business model canvas that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.430" end="00:36:03.230" style="s2">of people are probably familiar with and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.930" end="00:36:06.330" style="s2">I just tweaked the questions on the to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.230" end="00:36:09.180" style="s2">be specific to people working on</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.330" end="00:36:12.840" style="s2">implementing a particular SDG project</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.180" end="00:36:16.830" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the the SDG project canvas</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.840" end="00:36:19.970" style="s2">and then I also created a handbook which</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.830" end="00:36:22.670" style="s2">in a very detailed way</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.970" end="00:36:24.710" style="s2">explains to people how to run this</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.670" end="00:36:26.869" style="s2">one-day training of multipliers so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.710" end="00:36:28.280" style="s2">idea here was not just to create a tool</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.869" end="00:36:31.460" style="s2">that makes people think differently but</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.280" end="00:36:34.359" style="s2">also to create an analog version of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.460" end="00:36:36.980" style="s2">viral spread in a way and to basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.359" end="00:36:39.290" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s done the workshop the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.980" end="00:36:43.010" style="s2">one-day workshop who has a set of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.290" end="00:36:44.510" style="s2">cards and has a copy of the multipliers</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.010" end="00:36:46.780" style="s2">handbook which which you can download</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.510" end="00:36:49.970" style="s2">for free on the guy education website</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.780" end="00:36:53.240" style="s2">could potentially if they have just the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.970" end="00:36:55.820" style="s2">basic skills of being a facilitator or a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.240" end="00:36:58.010" style="s2">teacher group leader could run the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.820" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">workshop the next day in their community</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.010" end="00:37:05.630" style="s2">or in their in their business or in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">local town hall and when in a school or</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.630" end="00:37:13.340" style="s2">university to engage real people in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:16.070" style="s2">place around this idea of implementing</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.340" end="00:37:18.910" style="s2">the SDGs and and what what I should also</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.070" end="00:37:21.830" style="s2">say is that I&#39;m quite critical of of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.910" end="00:37:23.750" style="s2">some aspects of the SDG process</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.830" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">particularly I think that the 169</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.750" end="00:37:30.200" style="s2">targets under the 17 goals is where the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:32.930" style="s2">neoliberal Lobby has had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.200" end="00:37:34.820" style="s2">influence and has a yet again created</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.930" end="00:37:37.550" style="s2">this bias because they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.820" end="00:37:39.650" style="s2">targets and measurements it&#39;s yet again</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.550" end="00:37:42.050" style="s2">what an example of what I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.650" end="00:37:44.570" style="s2">at the beginning of this talk and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.050" end="00:37:46.700" style="s2">with to kuang quantity focused and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.570" end="00:37:49.130" style="s2">missed the qualitative relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.700" end="00:37:50.810" style="s2">and maybe in terms of the actual goals I</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.130" end="00:37:52.700" style="s2">would say that the the goal that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.810" end="00:37:54.980" style="s2">sabotaging all other goals to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.700" end="00:37:57.530" style="s2">implemented is the way that cool number</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.980" end="00:37:59.830" style="s2">eight is currently worded as decent work</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.530" end="00:38:02.510" style="s2">in economic growth because it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.830" end="00:38:04.700" style="s2">addressing the underlying issue that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.510" end="00:38:08.119" style="s2">structure drives behavior in systems and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.700" end="00:38:10.910" style="s2">a system that has an inbuilt growth</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.119" end="00:38:14.210" style="s2">imperative they because of our economic</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.910" end="00:38:17.240" style="s2">system being based on a way of creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.210" end="00:38:20.510" style="s2">money that creates money out of nothing</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.240" end="00:38:23.960" style="s2">and when debt is created and then has</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.510" end="00:38:27.619" style="s2">differential interest rates on loans and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.960" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">deposits it therefore creates a need for</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.619" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">economies to have to grow at three</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.599" end="00:38:33.860" style="s2">percent per annum or they collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:37.370" style="s2">ultimately that is a driver</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.860" end="00:38:38.870" style="s2">of degeneration and exploitation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.370" end="00:38:42.050" style="s2">people and planet and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.870" end="00:38:43.730" style="s2">address that issue then I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.050" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">will ever be able to implement all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.730" end="00:38:49.430" style="s2">other calls and so yet again all of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:52.760" style="s2">is an example both of an intervention</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.430" end="00:38:54.470" style="s2">tool of how do we design for positive</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.760" end="00:38:57.230" style="s2">emergence like you can see that all</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.470" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">these tools the cards the the canvas the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.230" end="00:39:04.340" style="s2">the book I can&#39;t predict and control and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:06.290" style="s2">manipulate much what these local groups</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.340" end="00:39:09.050" style="s2">of people will come up with when they</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.290" end="00:39:11.330" style="s2">have conversations using these tools but</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.050" end="00:39:13.430" style="s2">I can create the tools that will enable</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.330" end="00:39:16.070" style="s2">them and will guide them into a more</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.430" end="00:39:20.450" style="s2">systemic way of thinking about the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.070" end="00:39:24.050" style="s2">SDGs did the very tool itself might help</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.450" end="00:39:26.900" style="s2">them to come up with ideas and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.050" end="00:39:29.540" style="s2">projects that will actually result in</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.900" end="00:39:32.930" style="s2">positive emergence rather than them more</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.540" end="00:39:34.490" style="s2">of the same and so um how we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.930" end="00:39:36.650" style="s2">for time because I on the one hand I</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.490" end="00:39:39.410" style="s2">could go on but maybe I could also stop</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.650" end="00:39:48.170" style="s2">here and and just on us some questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.410" end="00:39:50.780" style="s2">and then we can go I think then I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.170" end="00:39:52.250" style="s2">rather than then going on much longer I</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.780" end="00:39:53.900" style="s2">think I&#39;d rather open up for</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.250" end="00:39:55.910" style="s2">conversations and if I then feel like</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.900" end="00:39:59.330" style="s2">picking up some more of the slide so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.910" end="00:40:01.160" style="s2">can do that we just go here and stop</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.330" end="00:40:05.420" style="s2">sharing I can see you all again</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.160" end="00:40:07.880" style="s2">that&#39;s much better anybody online your</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.420" end="00:40:14.660" style="s2">question just jump in here you just need</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.880" end="00:40:18.080" style="s2">to unmute yourself or a reflection this</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.660" end="00:40:20.360" style="s2">was too abstract yeah no I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.080" end="00:40:22.640" style="s2">great you know when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.360" end="00:40:24.230" style="s2">about in economic growth I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.640" end="00:40:28.010" style="s2">about Rihanna&#39;s verse work</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.230" end="00:40:29.990" style="s2">the caring economy you know she took the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.010" end="00:40:33.080" style="s2">GDP and then added all the social</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.990" end="00:40:35.000" style="s2">indicators to that and like volunteerism</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.080" end="00:40:38.330" style="s2">and things like that that makes strong</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.000" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">communities and strong Nations so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.330" end="00:40:44.090" style="s2">we definitely need new indicators that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:47.570" style="s2">mean GDP is goes up if you have a war or</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.090" end="00:40:52.300" style="s2">if you have natural catastrophe and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.570" end="00:40:57.070" style="s2">so I can I can put in the chat box or</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.300" end="00:40:57.070" style="s2">like I in my medium block that lots of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.340" end="00:41:04.660" style="s2">alternative indicators okay that was our</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.080" end="00:41:08.930" style="s2">degree I I have a comment about</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.660" end="00:41:11.900" style="s2">economics and it&#39;s really helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.930" end="00:41:14.980" style="s2">hear what you have to say today Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.900" end="00:41:17.870" style="s2">it really and my brains going mad at me</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.980" end="00:41:22.430" style="s2">thank you for everything but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.870" end="00:41:24.110" style="s2">system same isn&#39;t it and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.430" end="00:41:28.550" style="s2">communities that were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.110" end="00:41:31.100" style="s2">building in Bristol in England to start</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.550" end="00:41:33.500" style="s2">with anyway we&#39;re using the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.100" end="00:41:36.260" style="s2">sustainability framework of one planet</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.500" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">living but we&#39;re also going to see what</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.260" end="00:41:43.540" style="s2">we can do to put into practice</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:47.570" style="s2">do not seek anomic like a trailer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.540" end="00:41:52.330" style="s2">and so I&#39;m in contacted her a fair bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.570" end="00:41:56.450" style="s2">and my I put a slide in my presentation</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.330" end="00:41:58.970" style="s2">about our project and so what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.450" end="00:42:03.740" style="s2">aiming to do is to meet everyone&#39;s needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.970" end="00:42:07.700" style="s2">within the within the means of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.740" end="00:42:12.260" style="s2">planet so that will that will become our</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.700" end="00:42:15.950" style="s2">basic question our overarching kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.260" end="00:42:18.890" style="s2">question and we can keep asking each</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.950" end="00:42:24.010" style="s2">other as we&#39;re building a medium living</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.890" end="00:42:27.430" style="s2">it are all of the only thing left and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.010" end="00:42:30.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve got some measurables from Kate now</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.430" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">and we can keep as well as having the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.680" end="00:42:37.250" style="s2">qualitative bit we can keep measuring</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:40.520" style="s2">that within our little micro community</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.250" end="00:42:42.140" style="s2">we&#39;re not overshooting the boundaries so</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.520" end="00:42:46.070" style="s2">we&#39;re going to start playing with that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.140" end="00:42:48.710" style="s2">and then those other communities pop up</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.070" end="00:42:54.650" style="s2">around the city and further afield see</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.710" end="00:42:56.210" style="s2">if we can keep replicating that and as</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.650" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">you say each community is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.210" end="00:43:02.590" style="s2">diff tending like paper</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:05.950" style="s2">to see how things can be tweaked and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.590" end="00:43:10.510" style="s2">shifted and and by asking the same basic</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.950" end="00:43:14.250" style="s2">questions and principles and how and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.510" end="00:43:17.320" style="s2">just not paying attention to GDP at all</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.250" end="00:43:20.050" style="s2">focusing entirely on meeting everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.320" end="00:43:22.810" style="s2">needs in our community and making sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.050" end="00:43:25.000" style="s2">we&#39;re not overshooting and I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.810" end="00:43:31.150" style="s2">that we can prove to one man Marvin</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.000" end="00:43:34.990" style="s2">Reese who&#39;s still tied in to GDP but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.150" end="00:43:37.270" style="s2">have talked to him about cake book I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.990" end="00:43:39.880" style="s2">hoping to prove that we need to look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.270" end="00:43:43.060" style="s2">GDP at all so we&#39;ll see how we go with</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.880" end="00:43:45.430" style="s2">that what I would say I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.060" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">wonderful initiative and and I love</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.430" end="00:43:49.330" style="s2">Kate&#39;s work it&#39;s actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:52.300" style="s2">things that I really want to do more is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.330" end="00:43:54.550" style="s2">to include like bring Kate&#39;s worth and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.300" end="00:43:58.030" style="s2">work in my work closer together and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.550" end="00:44:01.720" style="s2">contextualize them and I mean from a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.030" end="00:44:02.770" style="s2">personal experience and I spent a long</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">time working with</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.770" end="00:44:07.570" style="s2">the Eco village movement and also with</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">the transition town movement because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.570" end="00:44:13.570" style="s2">was very keen on this and start local</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:16.750" style="s2">think global act local and all that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.570" end="00:44:19.900" style="s2">and trying to create patterns as back</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.750" end="00:44:22.570" style="s2">back then in in 1999 when I tried to set</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.900" end="00:44:24.970" style="s2">up an eco village in southern Spain our</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.570" end="00:44:26.380" style="s2">aim was to be part of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.970" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">rather than to be part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.380" end="00:44:36.790" style="s2">but what I have got to in my own</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:39.310" style="s2">learning is that we need to work at all</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.790" end="00:44:43.030" style="s2">the scales at one in the same time like</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.310" end="00:44:44.589" style="s2">what would you like because all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.030" end="00:44:47.260" style="s2">models you&#39;re trying to build in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.589" end="00:44:50.349" style="s2">renowned briscoe and are still sitting</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.260" end="00:44:52.510" style="s2">within this nested whole urkki of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.349" end="00:44:54.099" style="s2">systems that are actually fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.510" end="00:44:56.920" style="s2">structurally dysfunctional and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.099" end="00:44:59.710" style="s2">degenerative and they will affect you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.920" end="00:45:02.859" style="s2">and and I mean at fintan we we try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.710" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">live a one planet footprint lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.859" end="00:45:09.020" style="s2">and and just after I got there</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:11.600" style="s2">ecological footprint study of of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.020" end="00:45:14.119" style="s2">community and it was half the UK but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.600" end="00:45:17.420" style="s2">was by no means within planetary</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.119" end="00:45:19.130" style="s2">boundaries so it&#39;s not that easy and to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.420" end="00:45:20.930" style="s2">create a system that that is within</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.130" end="00:45:23.480" style="s2">planetary boundaries right now but</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.930" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">what&#39;s powerful about Kate&#39;s work is is</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.480" end="00:45:29.869" style="s2">that she reminds us not to just look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">the ecological transgressions but also</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.869" end="00:45:36.080" style="s2">the social foundations and the economic</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:41.660" style="s2">foundations that enable people to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.080" end="00:45:45.140" style="s2">that and but I but I guess for Ann what</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.660" end="00:45:47.570" style="s2">I would encourage you to do is because</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.140" end="00:45:49.460" style="s2">once you start a community process and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.570" end="00:45:51.650" style="s2">you really engage with it it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.460" end="00:45:54.710" style="s2">easy to create a bubble around that</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.650" end="00:45:59.690" style="s2">process and and to only focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.710" end="00:46:02.210" style="s2">and I think it understand these</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.690" end="00:46:04.100" style="s2">initiatives in networks with other</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.210" end="00:46:06.530" style="s2">initiatives that also happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.100" end="00:46:09.140" style="s2">wider region around Bristol and even to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.530" end="00:46:11.690" style="s2">think of Bristol within its bio region</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.140" end="00:46:15.770" style="s2">and to start really like I moved to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.690" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">Majorca because I wanted to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.770" end="00:46:20.450" style="s2">place where I could explore</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:23.420" style="s2">transformative innovation by regional</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.450" end="00:46:25.940" style="s2">scale how do we how do we work with</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.420" end="00:46:27.859" style="s2">community but how do we do so in the bio</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.940" end="00:46:31.490" style="s2">regional content it&#39;s like I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.859" end="00:46:33.980" style="s2">if we if we are to redesign the human</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.490" end="00:46:37.369" style="s2">impact on earth in the time available to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.980" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">avoid cataclysmic climate change we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.369" end="00:46:43.190" style="s2">to come back to patterns that are more</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:46.430" style="s2">by regional rather than national or only</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.190" end="00:46:50.570" style="s2">local um because there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.430" end="00:46:54.140" style="s2">that scale of multiple communities</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.570" end="00:46:55.970" style="s2">working within a watershed to meet their</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.140" end="00:46:59.600" style="s2">needs that you can actually get a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.970" end="00:47:03.580" style="s2">systemic whole systems design in place</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.600" end="00:47:07.550" style="s2">to do what you&#39;re trying to do yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.580" end="00:47:09.350" style="s2">because were looking at natural building</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.550" end="00:47:11.450" style="s2">and one of the sites were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.350" end="00:47:16.250" style="s2">house of woodland right next door with</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.450" end="00:47:19.190" style="s2">lots of hazel copies that we can use to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.250" end="00:47:20.510" style="s2">start building with and but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.190" end="00:47:25.010" style="s2">talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.510" end="00:47:28.430" style="s2">you have a license to grow hemp in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.010" end="00:47:31.609" style="s2">Bayeux region and starting to talk with</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.430" end="00:47:37.340" style="s2">them if we could start to create some</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.609" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">kind of resource and local economy where</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.340" end="00:47:42.710" style="s2">where we get all the materials we need</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:45.140" style="s2">to build the houses in the city in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.710" end="00:47:47.590" style="s2">bio region grow them locally and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.140" end="00:47:54.800" style="s2">encourage local landowners to do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.590" end="00:47:56.930" style="s2">and that for me that when I say the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:48:01.070" style="s2">redesign is by a regional I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.930" end="00:48:04.550" style="s2">also about creating a circular economy</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.070" end="00:48:05.810" style="s2">at the bio regional scale that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.550" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">make the mistake that the Ellen</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.810" end="00:48:10.150" style="s2">MacArthur Foundation tends to make when</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:12.830" style="s2">they talk about the two cycles of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.150" end="00:48:14.980" style="s2">industrial metabolism biological</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.830" end="00:48:17.480" style="s2">metabolism and they talk about it as if</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.980" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">astro metabolism cycle could go on</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.480" end="00:48:25.420" style="s2">forever and but that they use this fancy</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:28.100" style="s2">word upcycling and and and basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.420" end="00:48:30.260" style="s2">it&#39;s physically and chemically</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.100" end="00:48:33.730" style="s2">impossible and energetically impossible</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.260" end="00:48:36.680" style="s2">to upcycle these kind of elements</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.730" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">continuously forever they what we really</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.680" end="00:48:42.140" style="s2">need to do is to over the next 150 200</p>

<p begin="00:50:03.930" end="00:50:08.290" style="s2">looking at the schedule if you will and</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.250" end="00:50:28.390" style="s2">fast as possible so I&#39;m myself looking</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.060" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">at systems of governance and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.390" end="00:50:32.830" style="s2">actually affect the changes and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:35.260" style="s2">movements within our governments that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.830" end="00:50:37.390" style="s2">are very caught in their own paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.260" end="00:50:38.560" style="s2">at the moment still very much here in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.390" end="00:50:41.800" style="s2">Vancouver Canada very much a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.560" end="00:50:43.090" style="s2">capitalistic paradigm and everything</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.110" end="00:50:52.440" style="s2">message joy in the messaging that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.790" end="00:50:55.660" style="s2">have this incredible opportunity in the</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.850" end="00:51:07.080" style="s2">includes much of which is the global</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.080" end="00:51:11.890" style="s2">and those borders in the stand and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.640" end="00:51:14.770" style="s2">they&#39;re not by by all regions they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.890" end="00:51:17.230" style="s2">actually countries that are that with</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.230" end="00:51:21.340" style="s2">and that are blocking much of this and a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.780" end="00:51:24.940" style="s2">lot of the power and control still</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.340" end="00:51:26.380" style="s2">remains there and so you know when</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.940" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing some of these incredible</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.380" end="00:51:30.550" style="s2">movers I&#39;m getting to my question some</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">of these incredible movements was with</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.550" end="00:51:36.460" style="s2">systems thinking opera with theory you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:38.650" style="s2">and there&#39;s just so many more it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.460" end="00:51:41.740" style="s2">to pull these together into a real force</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.650" end="00:51:45.430" style="s2">where we can start to move towards these</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.740" end="00:51:46.779" style="s2">political systems and started I guess</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.430" end="00:51:49.239" style="s2">encourage the Paul</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.779" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">additions to start seeing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.239" end="00:51:54.429" style="s2">from a different paradigm to create that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:56.499" style="s2">very fast change you think do you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.429" end="00:51:59.469" style="s2">that&#39;s possible to do that to get that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.499" end="00:52:04.390" style="s2">kind of movement and if not then how do</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.469" end="00:52:08.349" style="s2">we move fast enough that&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.390" end="00:52:09.429" style="s2">question isn&#39;t it and do we want to take</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.349" end="00:52:18.239" style="s2">a couple more questions or shall I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.429" end="00:52:27.130" style="s2">answer this one first people okay yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.239" end="00:52:29.259" style="s2">yes not on that one in other parts of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.130" end="00:52:31.269" style="s2">my writing if you if you go onto my</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.259" end="00:52:34.499" style="s2">medium block and you just put in my name</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.269" end="00:52:37.059" style="s2">and medium and then three horizons</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.499" end="00:52:39.189" style="s2">you&#39;ll get a number of links to this</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.059" end="00:52:43.419" style="s2">three horizon model that that is quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.189" end="00:52:45.759" style="s2">useful to start thinking about these big</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.419" end="00:52:47.739" style="s2">transitions that we need to make and um</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.759" end="00:52:49.779" style="s2">the reason why I bring this up is</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.739" end="00:52:52.779" style="s2">because they&#39;re the conventional sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.779" end="00:52:55.779" style="s2">that nation state and what is called</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.669" end="00:53:05.529" style="s2">in the old paradigm one way of shifting</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.539" end="00:53:09.099" style="s2">it is is to really pay more attention to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.529" end="00:53:11.709" style="s2">what&#39;s already growing some of the the</p>

<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:51.390" style="s2">I think that we need to combine all that</p>

<p begin="00:56:20.230" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve got on the different Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.180" end="00:56:26.080" style="s2">groups and in my Twitter feed and so on</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:29.350" style="s2">all the people that I meet at</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.080" end="00:56:31.300" style="s2">conferences were all in in the same echo</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.350" end="00:56:33.310" style="s2">chamber um and we&#39;re talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.300" end="00:56:35.110" style="s2">other about this and and yes the echo</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.310" end="00:56:37.990" style="s2">chamber is growing what I like to call</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.110" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">the regeneration rising it&#39;s becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.990" end="00:56:45.420" style="s2">bigger and bigger echo chamber but what</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">I think we really need to engage is all</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.420" end="00:56:50.620" style="s2">the cultural creative mechanisms I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:55.030" style="s2">we need to engage the musicians the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.620" end="00:56:58.180" style="s2">theater plays artists and fine art on</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.030" end="00:57:02.250" style="s2">all scales that the big names and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.180" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">small neighborhood busker to basically</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.250" end="00:57:07.360" style="s2">bring this way of thinking in this way</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:09.820" style="s2">of seeing into the public and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.360" end="00:57:13.330" style="s2">discourse in as diverse a way as</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.820" end="00:57:16.870" style="s2">possible and I&#39;m beginning to work with</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.330" end="00:57:19.030" style="s2">a foundation on on these issues like how</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.870" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">do we create a traveling exhibition on</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.030" end="00:57:24.870" style="s2">by biomimicry on regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:27.820" style="s2">development and regenerative design and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.870" end="00:57:29.620" style="s2">in a way that engages some of the big</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.820" end="00:57:32.320" style="s2">names in the art industry and through</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.620" end="00:57:34.360" style="s2">them then brings people into this</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.320" end="00:57:37.450" style="s2">conversation that that might just come</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.360" end="00:57:40.110" style="s2">because each one of the exhibits also</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.450" end="00:57:43.030" style="s2">has a painting by a famous artist and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.110" end="00:57:45.460" style="s2">but then they engage with the material</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.030" end="00:57:48.070" style="s2">of the exhibit in a deeper way and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.460" end="00:57:52.180" style="s2">you begin to build bridges to to those</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.070" end="00:57:53.950" style="s2">other constituencies and similar way in</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.180" end="00:57:57.730" style="s2">on the 10th of May I&#39;m hoping to meet a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.950" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">very famous might as well mention his</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.730" end="00:58:02.560" style="s2">name Lenny Kravitz um somebody is trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.190" end="00:58:06.730" style="s2">to put me together with Lenny Kravitz to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.560" end="00:58:08.800" style="s2">have a conversation how his work which</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:11.140" style="s2">is already I don&#39;t know if you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.800" end="00:58:13.780" style="s2">some of the lyrics from his latest album</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.140" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">raising vibrations I haven&#39;t listened to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.780" end="00:58:18.850" style="s2">some of his stuff for probably a decade</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:22.090" style="s2">but but when I tuned in to that album I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.850" end="00:58:24.670" style="s2">realized that that it speaks the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.090" end="00:58:27.880" style="s2">language as the regeneration rising it</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.670" end="00:58:29.950" style="s2">speaks a language of one</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.880" end="00:58:31.930" style="s2">for example is called it&#39;s enough and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.950" end="00:58:36.190" style="s2">another one is called here to love and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.930" end="00:58:38.349" style="s2">and they really do acupuncture with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.190" end="00:58:41.829" style="s2">social system and address these issues</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.349" end="00:58:44.019" style="s2">and and I think once we we engaged the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.829" end="00:58:46.029" style="s2">music industry and reach two or three</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.019" end="00:58:48.490" style="s2">billion people on the planet at a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.029" end="00:58:51.130" style="s2">shallow level if that&#39;s the funnel that</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.490" end="00:58:53.619" style="s2">then brings only four or five percent of</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.130" end="00:58:56.859" style="s2">them to the next level and then one</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.619" end="00:58:59.559" style="s2">percent of those to a deeper level we</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.859" end="00:59:01.569" style="s2">will already have a much different</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.559" end="00:59:04.059" style="s2">situation as we have now we will have</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.569" end="00:59:07.690" style="s2">created critical mass so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.059" end="00:59:14.529" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m putting my my work</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.690" end="00:59:16.930" style="s2">towards important thing or described an</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.529" end="00:59:19.509" style="s2">important aspect of getting our beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.930" end="00:59:21.099" style="s2">out because we we&#39;re very passionate</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.509" end="00:59:23.049" style="s2">about this then we know that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.099" end="00:59:25.029" style="s2">do this but we have to find the right</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.049" end="00:59:27.730" style="s2">language and the right avenues and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.029" end="00:59:30.789" style="s2">right everything to actually interact</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.730" end="00:59:34.089" style="s2">with people who don&#39;t quite get it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.789" end="00:59:36.910" style="s2">and that&#39;s a that is a tap dance at</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.089" end="00:59:42.390" style="s2">times to try to figure out what is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.910" end="00:59:46.690" style="s2">right language absolutely and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.390" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">find it&#39;s people can also fall into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.690" end="00:59:50.740" style="s2">trap of saying oh I can&#39;t mention this</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:54.309" style="s2">to my client or I can&#39;t mention this to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.740" end="00:59:56.549" style="s2">the head of the City Planning Board</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.309" end="00:59:59.980" style="s2">because they&#39;ll think I&#39;m strange I</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.549" end="01:00:02.049" style="s2">always find if if we find if you fight</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.980" end="01:00:04.000" style="s2">the right if you find the right language</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.049" end="01:00:07.299" style="s2">in the right entry points and you build</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.000" end="01:00:10.809" style="s2">trust on a couple of issues and it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.299" end="01:00:13.779" style="s2">okay to then naming that the larger</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.809" end="01:00:15.789" style="s2">vision is a longer term vision and might</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.779" end="01:00:16.569" style="s2">not be for tomorrow or the day after</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.789" end="01:00:19.119" style="s2">tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.569" end="01:00:21.460" style="s2">but but it is important to also push the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.119" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">boundaries and name these real</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.460" end="01:00:27.519" style="s2">transformative changes and like like I I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:29.829" style="s2">think people have responded quite well</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.519" end="01:00:32.049" style="s2">to some of the the means I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.829" end="01:00:34.839" style="s2">putting out which are these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.049" end="01:00:37.299" style="s2">audacious statements like redesigning</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.839" end="01:00:40.410" style="s2">the human impact on earth that&#39;s massive</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.299" end="01:00:42.269" style="s2">um but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.410" end="01:00:44.789" style="s2">I think that&#39;s ultimately what were</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.269" end="01:00:47.249" style="s2">challenged to do but we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.789" end="01:00:52.049" style="s2">do it at a global scale from the start</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.249" end="01:00:54.210" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this idea that you might have</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.049" end="01:00:56.279" style="s2">heard this word glocal there&#39;s put into</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.210" end="01:00:58.170" style="s2">the word together the word global and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.279" end="01:00:59.970" style="s2">local and I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.170" end="01:01:05.549" style="s2">transformative action that is needed now</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.970" end="01:01:08.789" style="s2">is local action it is working one at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.549" end="01:01:13.229" style="s2">same time locally by originally in</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.789" end="01:01:15.450" style="s2">globally and particularly like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.229" end="01:01:17.579" style="s2">regenerative solutions are adapted to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.450" end="01:01:20.999" style="s2">the bio cultural uniqueness of place and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.579" end="01:01:22.979" style="s2">region the enabling factor is the global</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.999" end="01:01:25.650" style="s2">collaboration and knowledge exchange and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.979" end="01:01:27.239" style="s2">I&#39;d love to hear Johnny&#39;s take on like</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.650" end="01:01:29.460" style="s2">because he&#39;s preparing this wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.239" end="01:01:32.339" style="s2">conference in Malaga coming up very soon</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.460" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">on social innovation and how does this</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.339" end="01:01:38.759" style="s2">all connect to what you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:41.960" style="s2">talking about room messy well the first</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.759" end="01:01:44.789" style="s2">thing I would like to say is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.960" end="01:01:48.719" style="s2">project 20 years ago that was called</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.789" end="01:01:51.299" style="s2">local ecosystems so the local it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.719" end="01:01:53.329" style="s2">very very connected to me and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.299" end="01:01:56.219" style="s2">term that I&#39;ve been using and in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.329" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">well my methodology that I&#39;m sharing for</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.219" end="01:02:01.229" style="s2">this 20 years is based on the concept</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:03.930" style="s2">that we have to go to separate the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.229" end="01:02:06.359" style="s2">global bits like the immaterial world</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.930" end="01:02:09.390" style="s2">has to go global but the material world</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.359" end="01:02:11.910" style="s2">has to go local so is local is local</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.390" end="01:02:14.400" style="s2">atoms and global bits so it has to we</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.910" end="01:02:17.549" style="s2">have to differentiate these two aspects</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.400" end="01:02:20.069" style="s2">of the economy and the reality what</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.549" end="01:02:22.859" style="s2">things are in material what-what needs</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.069" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">we have that are in material and in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.859" end="01:02:27.450" style="s2">ecovillage movement from where I come</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:29.729" style="s2">from where I live in an eco village and</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.450" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">I&#39;m part of the Eco village movement and</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.729" end="01:02:36.390" style="s2">I&#39;m head of economy in the movement in</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:39.630" style="s2">in Spain we we believe that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.390" end="01:02:41.309" style="s2">solve our our needs in our in material</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.630" end="01:02:43.259" style="s2">needs in a completely different way as</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.309" end="01:02:45.539" style="s2">we solve the material needs so we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.259" end="01:02:48.210" style="s2">to go out of this materialism and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.539" end="01:02:52.440" style="s2">focusing though in a more in different</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.210" end="01:02:54.240" style="s2">ways of solving the economy so in SE and</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.440" end="01:02:57.720" style="s2">was the question I wanted to to to pose</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.240" end="01:03:02.730" style="s2">is we are planning to to create a vision</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.720" end="01:03:06.030" style="s2">of the 2013 2030 have I like a good</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.730" end="01:03:08.060" style="s2">vision that people can be inspired to</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.030" end="01:03:10.530" style="s2">because we are talking about a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.060" end="01:03:13.079" style="s2">catastrophic situation that we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.530" end="01:03:16.109" style="s2">right now but I think people need hope</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.079" end="01:03:17.640" style="s2">people need to see a place where we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.109" end="01:03:19.730" style="s2">go and that&#39;s exactly what we are going</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.640" end="01:03:23.880" style="s2">to do in Nessie we are going to try to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.730" end="01:03:26.790" style="s2">to create like an environment where</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.880" end="01:03:30.270" style="s2">people can leave what the world could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.790" end="01:03:33.900" style="s2">in 2030 in these six strands that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.270" end="01:03:37.020" style="s2">divided NASA food and energy and Housing</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.900" end="01:03:39.569" style="s2">and Finance and all these different</p>

<p begin="01:03:44.069" end="01:03:49.400" style="s2">there but for me what I would like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.349" end="01:03:53.940" style="s2">hear from you is how do you see a</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.400" end="01:03:56.609" style="s2">realistic but ideal future in 2030 with</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.940" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">this with this way of thinking which I</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.609" end="01:04:06.589" style="s2">completely share well I heard from</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:09.000" style="s2">Thomas power the but you were blessed</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.589" end="01:04:13.140" style="s2">trying to work with the three horizons</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.000" end="01:04:16.109" style="s2">framework that I mentioned earlier and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.140" end="01:04:19.859" style="s2">in part of the strength of this 3d</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.109" end="01:04:22.980" style="s2">rising framework is that none of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.859" end="01:04:26.819" style="s2">three arises disappear so you have the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.980" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">old system that also the red line still</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.819" end="01:04:32.550" style="s2">exists on the far ends of whether the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:36.240" style="s2">third horizon has become dominant and</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.550" end="01:04:39.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s a key message that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.240" end="01:04:40.980" style="s2">also what is valuable about the current</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.390" end="01:04:45.540" style="s2">system that we actually still want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.980" end="01:04:47.310" style="s2">have integrate all 2050 I almost just to</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.540" end="01:04:47.880" style="s2">push this time horizon out a little</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.310" end="01:04:52.410" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.880" end="01:04:54.839" style="s2">like 2045 because 2030 is very close for</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.410" end="01:04:58.079" style="s2">some real transformative changes to have</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.839" end="01:05:01.619" style="s2">happened by then and and while I</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.079" end="01:05:04.530" style="s2">completely understand that in order to</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.619" end="01:05:06.450" style="s2">manage a large group of 600 or 700</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.530" end="01:05:11.160" style="s2">people in different peril</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.450" end="01:05:16.380" style="s2">screams music locusts and things like</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.160" end="01:05:19.530" style="s2">that to some extent part of the the old</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.380" end="01:05:23.010" style="s2">way of thinking to go food economy</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.530" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">housing transport and because somehow</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.010" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">they are also all related so if for for</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:33.109" style="s2">process sake to manage the people you</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:35.030" style="s2">want to start off with that theme um</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.109" end="01:05:38.099" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.030" end="01:05:40.680" style="s2">processes that also engage people to say</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.099" end="01:05:42.089" style="s2">okay what are they what are the common</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.680" end="01:05:43.470" style="s2">grounds and what are the intersection</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.089" end="01:05:45.720" style="s2">points between these things how does</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.470" end="01:05:49.500" style="s2">transport relate to economy ID how does</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.720" end="01:05:51.150" style="s2">a housing relate to climate and or</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.500" end="01:05:54.809" style="s2">whatever the things are I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.150" end="01:05:57.839" style="s2">the ones you mentioned but but basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.809" end="01:06:00.780" style="s2">find a place to reintegrate that full</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.839" end="01:06:05.220" style="s2">separation that that you created by</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.780" end="01:06:07.290" style="s2">keeping it in the thematics and um and</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.220" end="01:06:09.000" style="s2">the other thing that I find really</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.290" end="01:06:12.089" style="s2">powerful about the three horizon</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.000" end="01:06:14.700" style="s2">framework is that when you&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.089" end="01:06:17.460" style="s2">long journey of okay you&#39;ve got the red</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.700" end="01:06:19.319" style="s2">for horizon one has dips down and and it</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.460" end="01:06:23.430" style="s2">becomes less prevalent you have the</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.319" end="01:06:24.960" style="s2">green horizons three becoming more</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.430" end="01:06:26.369" style="s2">prevalent and then you can use the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.960" end="01:06:29.520" style="s2">bridge which is really the social</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.369" end="01:06:33.030" style="s2">innovation and innovation bridge of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.520" end="01:06:35.130" style="s2">second horizon to avoid collapse and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.030" end="01:06:38.099" style="s2">rebuild and actually use that bridge to</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.130" end="01:06:41.940" style="s2">get into a future without the trauma</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.099" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">that would come with a collapse and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.940" end="01:06:47.069" style="s2">a it&#39;s a powerful model partially</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:48.930" style="s2">because when you get to the top of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.069" end="01:06:50.819" style="s2">green hill of the third horizon being</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.930" end="01:06:52.530" style="s2">prevalent and you look down at what</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.819" end="01:06:55.740" style="s2">you&#39;re standing on you standing on red</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.530" end="01:06:59.609" style="s2">ground and like you you&#39;re the new</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.740" end="01:07:02.369" style="s2">horizons one and in that I think is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.609" end="01:07:05.190" style="s2">powerful so I&#39;m not gonna answer the</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.369" end="01:07:08.730" style="s2">question of where do I where do I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.190" end="01:07:10.410" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be in 2030 M because I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.730" end="01:07:12.750" style="s2">we&#39;re still gonna be on that journey and</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.410" end="01:07:14.309" style="s2">it&#39;s a journey that will never end the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.750" end="01:07:17.609" style="s2">journey of creating regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.309" end="01:07:20.310" style="s2">cultures is is a big because of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.609" end="01:07:24.060" style="s2">dynamic understanding of process</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.310" end="01:07:25.740" style="s2">and of our strange embeddedness in this</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.060" end="01:07:27.900" style="s2">process that what you were saying that</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.740" end="01:07:30.270" style="s2">the inner and the outer the material and</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.900" end="01:07:32.400" style="s2">and and and the information are linked</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.270" end="01:07:35.340" style="s2">and they inform each other they bring</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.400" end="01:07:38.550" style="s2">forth each other and therefore this</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.340" end="01:07:41.690" style="s2">process of inquiry will will go on</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.550" end="01:07:46.320" style="s2">forever um and all we can do is is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.690" end="01:07:50.730" style="s2">try to build the capacity of people in</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.320" end="01:07:53.100" style="s2">place to keep responding to changes at</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.730" end="01:07:56.130" style="s2">the local regional and global scale in</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.100" end="01:07:58.290" style="s2">ways that increases the viability and</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.130" end="01:08:02.700" style="s2">regenerative capacity of the system</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.290" end="01:08:05.010" style="s2">overall um and and so really to because</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.700" end="01:08:09.300" style="s2">also in response to the other question</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.010" end="01:08:11.670" style="s2">earlier like we even if we get it right</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.300" end="01:08:14.730" style="s2">in my opinion even if we get it right</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.670" end="01:08:16.589" style="s2">and we do get to scale or skin like</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.730" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s enough of a demand like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.589" end="01:08:22.230" style="s2">say Friday&#39;s for futures and parents for</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.960" end="01:08:24.660" style="s2">for futures get together and and builds</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.230" end="01:08:26.430" style="s2">the political demand that political</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.660" end="01:08:29.880" style="s2">leaders start responding in business</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.430" end="01:08:32.770" style="s2">starts responding yeah um we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.880" end="01:08:36.430" style="s2">this bizarre situation that</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.770" end="01:08:38.770" style="s2">like 20 21 to 20 30 is the eCos the UN</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.430" end="01:08:40.870" style="s2">decade for ecosystems restoration and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.770" end="01:08:44.049" style="s2">let&#39;s say we really put our effort</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.870" end="01:08:46.930" style="s2">behind it and we pair this idea with a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.049" end="01:08:49.630" style="s2">climate change reversal response and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.930" end="01:08:51.549" style="s2">pair this idea with donut economics and</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.630" end="01:08:54.040" style="s2">we say we want to create the social</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.549" end="01:08:56.770" style="s2">foundations and live within planetary</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.040" end="01:08:59.350" style="s2">boundaries even if we did all that as</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.770" end="01:09:04.299" style="s2">humanity for some reason we coordinated</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.350" end="01:09:08.560" style="s2">our human family in that way we still</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.299" end="01:09:11.529" style="s2">have to be honest about the fact that it</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.560" end="01:09:15.160" style="s2">will be a lot of hard work and in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.529" end="01:09:17.410" style="s2">next 10 15 years things might still get</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.160" end="01:09:19.900" style="s2">worse even if in the next one or two</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.410" end="01:09:22.060" style="s2">years we all decide to make the right</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.900" end="01:09:24.910" style="s2">decisions and we all start working on it</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.060" end="01:09:26.290" style="s2">full of full power and and I think for</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.910" end="01:09:28.029" style="s2">our movement for the people that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.290" end="01:09:31.380" style="s2">going to be getting rather than messy</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.029" end="01:09:33.339" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to be clear that</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.380" end="01:09:36.370" style="s2">because otherwise what we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.339" end="01:09:38.200" style="s2">is this initial Wow Wow the regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.370" end="01:09:40.150" style="s2">is rising and we&#39;re all doing it and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.200" end="01:09:41.739" style="s2">then after three four or five years</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.150" end="01:09:44.830" style="s2">things are still getting worse in terms</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.739" end="01:09:47.080" style="s2">of climate change effects and and global</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.830" end="01:09:49.540" style="s2">floods and and catastrophes and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.080" end="01:09:51.819" style="s2">people are saying it&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.540" end="01:09:54.040" style="s2">yeah the reality is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.819" end="01:09:57.100" style="s2">feedback like there&#39;s a delay in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.040" end="01:09:59.590" style="s2">system that is why we took so bloody</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.100" end="01:10:01.210" style="s2">long to respond 50 years we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.590" end="01:10:02.410" style="s2">knowing about that we needed to respond</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.210" end="01:10:03.520" style="s2">to this and we&#39;re only just about</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.410" end="01:10:06.100" style="s2">getting ready for it</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:10.060" style="s2">you said glocal 20 years ago you started</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.100" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">the system yeah like em we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.060" end="01:10:16.120" style="s2">honest that the next that three decades</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:19.390" style="s2">I think are gonna be a really rough ride</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.120" end="01:10:21.730" style="s2">and and we will see a lot of collapse</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.390" end="01:10:23.890" style="s2">and we will see a lot of breakdown and</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.730" end="01:10:26.770" style="s2">we need to celebrate that collapse in</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.890" end="01:10:29.050" style="s2">that break down as the dissolution of</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.770" end="01:10:32.020" style="s2">systems patterns and system structures</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.050" end="01:10:35.530" style="s2">that no longer serve and and not be</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.020" end="01:10:38.890" style="s2">fearful of the loss of terra firma and</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.530" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">and an institution&#39;s crumbling but we</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.890" end="01:10:43.300" style="s2">also need to be really really clear that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:45.670" style="s2">that even if we get it right its way in</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.300" end="01:10:46.420" style="s2">it for the long haul and and we never</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.670" end="01:10:48.360" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.420" end="01:10:49.930" style="s2">neither there is no destination</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.360" end="01:10:51.910" style="s2">sustainability and there is no</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.930" end="01:10:54.820" style="s2">destination regenerative culture that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.910" end="01:10:56.530" style="s2">perfect that we once we&#39;re there we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.820" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">duck down tools and live for help you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.530" end="01:11:01.690" style="s2">live happily ever after</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:11.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a continuous journey sorry to</p>

<p begin="01:11:11.050" end="01:11:14.890" style="s2">work so straightforward so so fast so</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.330" end="01:11:18.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s important to have that in mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.890" end="01:11:22.810" style="s2">yeah sure thank you thank you anybody</p>

<p begin="01:11:52.810" end="01:12:01.710" style="s2">because you have been an inspiration of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.870" end="01:12:05.770" style="s2">my my journey as a systems thinker and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.710" end="01:12:08.830" style="s2">practitioner as well so and basically a</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.770" end="01:12:13.360" style="s2">person that is facing a transition from</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.830" end="01:12:17.670" style="s2">the from the the story of separation to</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.360" end="01:12:23.590" style="s2">the story of integration and therefore a</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.670" end="01:12:27.730" style="s2">kind of brass being who we are</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.590" end="01:12:34.090" style="s2">participants of this creative power of</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.730" end="01:12:37.390" style="s2">the universe so and in this way I I was</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.090" end="01:12:41.140" style="s2">you know I was working in business as</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.390" end="01:12:46.470" style="s2">usual as a marketer about 50 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.140" end="01:12:49.090" style="s2">and I started to to identification</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.470" end="01:12:52.330" style="s2">disconnect between the being the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.090" end="01:12:58.660" style="s2">and the doing of business organizations</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.330" end="01:13:01.500" style="s2">so I start I started about 6 6 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.660" end="01:13:04.290" style="s2">social endeavor</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.500" end="01:13:07.630" style="s2">Hotels interactive is a systemic</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.290" end="01:13:11.770" style="s2">consultancy that we are aiming to to</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.630" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">develop human organizations as reflexive</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.770" end="01:13:19.480" style="s2">conversational and interdependent living</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:22.480" style="s2">systems so in this way we are working in</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.480" end="01:13:25.450" style="s2">what we call it the ecobee of</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.480" end="01:13:28.840" style="s2">psychosocial capital L capital eco bio</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.450" end="01:13:33.700" style="s2">psychosocial and you have been really</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.840" end="01:13:36.310" style="s2">helpful in in in giving shape of this</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.700" end="01:13:40.030" style="s2">build that is just starting it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.310" end="01:13:44.430" style="s2">emerging and he will I just want to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.030" end="01:13:48.910" style="s2">it will be great to to be to be in touch</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.430" end="01:13:55.000" style="s2">with you and keep on working of this in</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.910" end="01:13:57.820" style="s2">this building and that&#39;s all that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.000" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">than our question is I&#39;m really grateful</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.820" end="01:14:04.990" style="s2">for having this opportunity of</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:09.570" style="s2">conversing with this collective mind we</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.990" end="01:14:14.830" style="s2">are we certainly need to keep</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.570" end="01:14:17.110" style="s2">reinforcing this view and I totally</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.830" end="01:14:20.070" style="s2">agree and I&#39;m really convinced that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.110" end="01:14:24.580" style="s2">we need to start for the beginning and</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.070" end="01:14:27.490" style="s2">education is it&#39;s important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.580" end="01:14:30.760" style="s2">important how we can change we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.490" end="01:14:34.120" style="s2">cultivate new seeds of education because</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.760" end="01:14:38.080" style="s2">education is the basis of all this</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.120" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">change we cannot do anything if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.080" end="01:14:50.020" style="s2">intervene the education and that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.480" end="01:14:53.190" style="s2">main preoccupation I thank you hey thank</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.020" end="01:14:57.580" style="s2">you for the feedback because it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.190" end="01:15:01.090" style="s2">like sometimes they one wonders why I</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.580" end="01:15:03.700" style="s2">spent long nights putting stuff stuff up</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.090" end="01:15:05.470" style="s2">on medium or posting things and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.700" end="01:15:07.300" style="s2">always deeply appreciated to get</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.470" end="01:15:10.840" style="s2">feedback like this that it actually was</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.300" end="01:15:13.210" style="s2">meaningful to somebody and I I would</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.840" end="01:15:13.930" style="s2">agree that education is is crucial in</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.210" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.930" end="01:15:19.450" style="s2">like as I that definition of design</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:22.870" style="s2">human intentionality expressed through</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.450" end="01:15:25.180" style="s2">interactions and relationships so the</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.870" end="01:15:27.040" style="s2">the most upstream intervention that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.180" end="01:15:30.460" style="s2">can make is to change intentionality</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.040" end="01:15:32.500" style="s2">because then so change the why we design</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.460" end="01:15:34.570" style="s2">because then the how and the what we</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.500" end="01:15:37.240" style="s2">design changes immediately once we</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.570" end="01:15:40.600" style="s2">change the why and and that why change</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.240" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">happens through some form of Education</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.600" end="01:15:47.050" style="s2">but education has unfortunately very</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:48.520" style="s2">often been misunderstood is something</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.050" end="01:15:50.500" style="s2">that you do in the first third of your</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.520" end="01:15:54.010" style="s2">life and then you just work and then you</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.500" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">retire and and I think that the one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.010" end="01:15:58.840" style="s2">the the great mentors of regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:01.030" style="s2">development in in the Regenesis group</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.840" end="01:16:04.960" style="s2">and one of the key principles of</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.030" end="01:16:06.670" style="s2">regenerative development is local or</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.960" end="01:16:08.470" style="s2">regional capacity-building</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.670" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">like building the capacity of people to</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.470" end="01:16:14.620" style="s2">to live this dynamic process of adapting</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:18.300" style="s2">and and so really education is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.620" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">lifelong learning process that that</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.300" end="01:16:23.560" style="s2">needs to be at the core of what</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:28.930" style="s2">regenerative cultures are really all</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.560" end="01:16:31.000" style="s2">about and that that&#39;s why like when when</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.930" end="01:16:33.580" style="s2">I first started writing my book it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.000" end="01:16:35.740" style="s2">actually the working title I I started</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.580" end="01:16:38.650" style="s2">the book under was called living the</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.740" end="01:16:41.250" style="s2">questions together and this importance</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.650" end="01:16:44.130" style="s2">of of questions and the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.250" end="01:16:48.280" style="s2">engaging with other people around</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.130" end="01:16:51.340" style="s2">questions because and that very process</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.280" end="01:16:54.580" style="s2">is the process of building the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.340" end="01:16:56.710" style="s2">of people to respond to change in a way</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.580" end="01:16:59.170" style="s2">that is meaningful to their culture and</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.710" end="01:17:03.430" style="s2">that is appropriate to the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.170" end="01:17:07.240" style="s2">that they they live in um so in again</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.430" end="01:17:09.220" style="s2">the the regenerative development work of</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.240" end="01:17:11.170" style="s2">the Regenesis group and of Kara Sanford</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.220" end="01:17:13.810" style="s2">they speak of three levels of work in</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.170" end="01:17:16.240" style="s2">working regenerative lis and the first</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.810" end="01:17:19.210" style="s2">level is personal development the</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.240" end="01:17:22.180" style="s2">individual like it starts with the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.210" end="01:17:24.160" style="s2">individual and in our own work on</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.180" end="01:17:26.830" style="s2">ourselves in our capacity to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.160" end="01:17:27.820" style="s2">in our capacity to learn and be this</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.830" end="01:17:30.760" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.820" end="01:17:33.670" style="s2">Emily thinking patterns all of that and</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.760" end="01:17:36.250" style="s2">so that&#39;s the work of the designer him</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.670" end="01:17:39.490" style="s2">or herself then the next level of work</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.250" end="01:17:41.950" style="s2">is is the design process and which I</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.490" end="01:17:43.900" style="s2">would say is that engaging with others</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.950" end="01:17:47.860" style="s2">in this process of living the question</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.900" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">this dynamic I&#39;m not trying to find the</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.860" end="01:17:52.360" style="s2">solutions and the answers but to</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:54.760" style="s2">actually live the questions more deeply</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.360" end="01:17:57.070" style="s2">it&#39;s this wonderful quote that I start</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.760" end="01:17:59.710" style="s2">my book with by a Hyneman really look</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.070" end="01:18:02.680" style="s2">away he writes in a letter to a young</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.710" end="01:18:04.840" style="s2">poet you must live the questions more</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.680" end="01:18:06.820" style="s2">deeply because you might not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.840" end="01:18:09.280" style="s2">understand the answers yet and only if</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.820" end="01:18:11.110" style="s2">you live the questions then maybe one</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.280" end="01:18:14.650" style="s2">fine day will you live into the answers</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.110" end="01:18:17.170" style="s2">and and for me so that&#39;s the second</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.650" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">level of work this process of inquiry of</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.170" end="01:18:23.020" style="s2">how do we redesign the human presence on</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.080" end="01:18:26.230" style="s2">earth but how do we do it in this place</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.020" end="01:18:29.050" style="s2">out of this place in the context of its</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.230" end="01:18:30.940" style="s2">culture and its history and then the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.050" end="01:18:34.390" style="s2">the third level of work is what you</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.940" end="01:18:36.490" style="s2">design and so that the processes and</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.390" end="01:18:40.090" style="s2">structures and systems you put into</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.490" end="01:18:43.300" style="s2">place and if they are designed</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.090" end="01:18:45.970" style="s2">regenerative ly by people who work on</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.300" end="01:18:48.100" style="s2">the first and the second level then they</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.970" end="01:18:50.650" style="s2">should really increase the value and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.100" end="01:18:52.330" style="s2">health and vitality of the systems that</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.650" end="01:18:55.720" style="s2">they&#39;re touching and and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.330" end="01:18:58.900" style="s2">also see that my my previous work in my</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.720" end="01:19:00.670" style="s2">PhD and and the work of the Regenesis</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.900" end="01:19:03.400" style="s2">group and regenerative development is</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.670" end="01:19:07.420" style="s2">very aligned because like I I work with</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.400" end="01:19:10.270" style="s2">this notion of saluto genic or health</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.420" end="01:19:12.370" style="s2">generating design and really when they</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.270" end="01:19:14.350" style="s2">say increasing the value of the health</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.370" end="01:19:18.160" style="s2">of the system to me that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.350" end="01:19:20.710" style="s2">much the same issue like if if we only</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.160" end="01:19:23.230" style="s2">asked ourselves one question with</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.710" end="01:19:26.650" style="s2">everything we do in this kind of seventh</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.230" end="01:19:29.680" style="s2">generation type way and does it increase</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.650" end="01:19:32.250" style="s2">the health wholeness and vitality of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.680" end="01:19:34.780" style="s2">local the regional and the global system</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.250" end="01:19:37.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a powerful question to keep</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.780" end="01:19:39.430" style="s2">asking about all decisions and</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.750" end="01:19:42.280" style="s2">and if for some reason we feel it</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.430" end="01:19:47.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t then it might not be appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.280" end="01:19:51.520" style="s2">participation okay it&#39;s the time for one</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.320" end="01:20:00.270" style="s2">more but probably there&#39;s some parting</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.520" end="01:20:02.950" style="s2">words you want to give us or well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.270" end="01:20:06.250" style="s2">just always in encourage that people</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.950" end="01:20:09.370" style="s2">actually make the time to engage with</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.250" end="01:20:10.980" style="s2">the conversation like this and another</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.370" end="01:20:13.840" style="s2">part of me is kind of glowing or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.980" end="01:20:15.430" style="s2">seven people that dropped out maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.840" end="01:20:18.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t like what we talked about but</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.430" end="01:20:20.650" style="s2">that&#39;s just to show that personally I</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.610" end="01:20:24.460" style="s2">think they all had another engagement</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.650" end="01:20:27.910" style="s2">but they want the recording yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.460" end="01:20:30.400" style="s2">trying not to take it personal but just</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.910" end="01:20:32.080" style="s2">to make transparent the personal</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.400" end="01:20:36.130" style="s2">development process is ongoing as well</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:38.320" style="s2">like I am I still kind of go oh maybe I</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.130" end="01:20:40.210" style="s2">was too heady and all these these things</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.320" end="01:20:43.310" style="s2">that don&#39;t really serve us to be like</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.210" end="01:20:45.420" style="s2">one has to be self-critical but not self</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.310" end="01:20:49.260" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.420" end="01:20:51.910" style="s2">and yeah so so thank you all just for</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.260" end="01:20:55.300" style="s2">for caring for for living into these</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.910" end="01:20:58.690" style="s2">questions and for doing it in in your</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.300" end="01:21:02.560" style="s2">community in whatever way you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.690" end="01:21:03.760" style="s2">your work because it is all of us that</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.560" end="01:21:06.430" style="s2">are going to make the difference and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.760" end="01:21:10.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m absolutely convinced by</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.430" end="01:21:15.160" style="s2">and um and that gives me a lot of hope</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.780" end="01:21:18.820" style="s2">because it also means that we can be</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.160" end="01:21:23.950" style="s2">more gentle with ourselves when we need</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.820" end="01:21:27.430" style="s2">to just take care of our own needs and</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.950" end="01:21:30.550" style="s2">and an energy sometimes because I like</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.430" end="01:21:32.620" style="s2">the problem with with activists and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.550" end="01:21:34.720" style="s2">and trying to work for a better world is</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.620" end="01:21:38.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to lose oneself in</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.720" end="01:21:40.300" style="s2">burning out over that work and and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.380" end="01:21:42.340" style="s2">always remember that like when I trained</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.300" end="01:21:44.890" style="s2">in the way of counsel and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.340" end="01:21:46.570" style="s2">core principles of the way of counsel is</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.890" end="01:21:48.640" style="s2">that you always have to ask the question</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.570" end="01:21:51.280" style="s2">which is actually a deep indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.640" end="01:21:53.200" style="s2">wisdom ask the question</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.280" end="01:21:55.570" style="s2">with anything you do does it serve</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.200" end="01:21:57.370" style="s2">myself does it serve my community and</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.570" end="01:22:01.180" style="s2">does it serve life or does it serve the</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.370" end="01:22:03.490" style="s2">planet and as activists we&#39;d find it</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.180" end="01:22:05.290" style="s2">really easy to ask the question does it</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.490" end="01:22:05.890" style="s2">serve my community and doesn&#39;t serve the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.290" end="01:22:08.050" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.890" end="01:22:11.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s not so easy to ask the question</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.050" end="01:22:13.240" style="s2">does it serve myself and in this new way</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.560" end="01:22:14.920" style="s2">that I was kind of exploring in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.240" end="01:22:16.390" style="s2">beginning if if everything is</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.920" end="01:22:18.430" style="s2">interconnected and we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.390" end="01:22:20.740" style="s2">this inter being state there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.430" end="01:22:22.960" style="s2">fundamentally dynamic wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.740" end="01:22:25.870" style="s2">transforming then the only way that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.960" end="01:22:28.180" style="s2">can in a meaningful and continuous way</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.870" end="01:22:30.460" style="s2">serve the health of the whole to come</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.180" end="01:22:32.560" style="s2">forth is if we pay attention to our own</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.460" end="01:22:35.290" style="s2">health and it there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.560" end="01:22:36.850" style="s2">asking does it serve myself because if</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.290" end="01:22:38.170" style="s2">you don&#39;t serve yourself you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.850" end="01:22:41.470" style="s2">going to serve the community and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.170" end="01:22:46.810" style="s2">planet for very long and so that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.470" end="01:22:51.880" style="s2">me maybe a parting gift or advice that I</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.810" end="01:22:55.930" style="s2">also still have to remind myself of on a</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.880" end="01:22:57.790" style="s2">regular basis and and when you look into</p>
