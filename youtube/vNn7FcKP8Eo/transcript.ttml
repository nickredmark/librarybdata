<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:19.820" style="s2">don&#39;t not take her for two days because</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.410" end="00:04:21.109" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna save money I just don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.820" end="00:04:23.139" style="s2">to go sit in a doctor&#39;s office and have</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.109" end="00:04:25.000" style="s2">her with other germs and other</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.139" end="00:04:27.970" style="s2">other things when I know her immune</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.000" end="00:04:29.470" style="s2">system can probably handle it but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about whether me</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.470" end="00:04:33.969" style="s2">going to that doctor is gonna cost me my</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:35.860" style="s2">groceries for the week or month I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.969" end="00:04:40.900" style="s2">have to pay a copay I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.860" end="00:04:44.439" style="s2">worry about all the like the kids coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.900" end="00:04:46.210" style="s2">in like they can video hospitalized</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.439" end="00:04:47.979" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna be we just have less</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.210" end="00:04:49.599" style="s2">contagion I feel like there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.979" end="00:04:51.099" style="s2">a study done on that Canada less</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.599" end="00:04:53.050" style="s2">contagious in the States because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.099" end="00:04:55.509" style="s2">have universal health care I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.050" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">I feel like we must be we at least can</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.509" end="00:05:02.289" style="s2">deal with our colds and flus and not not</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:05:04.509" style="s2">pass them on I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.289" end="00:05:06.250" style="s2">immunizations covered in the states as</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.509" end="00:05:08.770" style="s2">far as like if everyone gets it for free</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.250" end="00:05:10.060" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t that also seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.770" end="00:05:12.159" style="s2">problematic especially you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.060" end="00:05:15.190" style="s2">people to get it and if the difference</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.159" end="00:05:16.990" style="s2">is if you&#39;re already on the fence about</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:19.449" style="s2">it and you believe in it that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.990" end="00:05:20.710" style="s2">getting it for financial reasons I just</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.449" end="00:05:25.539" style="s2">can see how that would be a problem for</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.710" end="00:05:31.779" style="s2">most people well get into that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.539" end="00:05:33.940" style="s2">different video but today I&#39;m just</p>
