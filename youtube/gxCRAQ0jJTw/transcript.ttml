<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:23.000" style="s2">who are typing that&#39;s awesome for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.350" end="00:06:24.380" style="s2">future I definitely think that having</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.000" end="00:06:27.470" style="s2">the notes will be helpful for me and for</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.380" end="00:06:30.760" style="s2">you so let&#39;s talk about section one</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:33.710" style="s2">right now this theory of paradigms so</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.760" end="00:06:35.150" style="s2">the idea here and I have calls actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.710" end="00:06:44.150" style="s2">the theory of change tool again let me</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.150" end="00:06:48.020" style="s2">share my screen and sweet beautiful so</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.150" end="00:06:51.200" style="s2">the idea here is the work that I mostly</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.020" end="00:06:51.760" style="s2">do is around paradigm change and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.200" end="00:06:54.760" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.760" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">is that if you have a lot of problems in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.760" end="00:06:57.490" style="s2">the world like climate change or</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:06:59.260" style="s2">inequality or right now we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.490" end="00:07:01.270" style="s2">covin 19 there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.260" end="00:07:03.490" style="s2">solutions that you can propose you could</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.270" end="00:07:05.320" style="s2">try to change norms like for climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.490" end="00:07:06.700" style="s2">change around playing fights if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.320" end="00:07:09.100" style="s2">trying to you know fight inequality you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.700" end="00:07:10.570" style="s2">can change the marginal tax rate or for</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.100" end="00:07:11.830" style="s2">code my team you can&#39;t like fun vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.570" end="00:07:15.160" style="s2">development there are a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.830" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">options here and all the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.160" end="00:07:18.820" style="s2">think about those that the highest</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:21.010" style="s2">leverage option is what&#39;s called like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.820" end="00:07:23.290" style="s2">paradigm change or like mindset change</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.010" end="00:07:25.870" style="s2">and this is from this great woman</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.290" end="00:07:27.910" style="s2">Donella Meadows in her book 12 leverage</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.870" end="00:07:30.070" style="s2">points or in a blog post on 12 leverage</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.910" end="00:07:31.510" style="s2">points where she talked about how if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.070" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">want to change that a little you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.510" end="00:07:36.210" style="s2">circle at the bottom left corner here</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.150" end="00:07:38.620" style="s2">you can either do it by changing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.210" end="00:07:40.420" style="s2">parameters which would be like changing</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.620" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">you know for the tax rate from 27</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.420" end="00:07:44.590" style="s2">percent to 20 percent or whatever or you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:45.760" style="s2">could change the goals so you just</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.590" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">actually say oh that&#39;s actually change</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.760" end="00:07:49.060" style="s2">the goals of the system or you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:52.060" style="s2">change its more abstract and called the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.060" end="00:07:54.580" style="s2">paradigm and that has the highest amount</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.060" end="00:07:56.050" style="s2">of leverage so as an example of this was</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.580" end="00:07:57.790" style="s2">something like Facebook if you are in</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.050" end="00:08:00.520" style="s2">Facebook and you think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.790" end="00:08:02.680" style="s2">there&#39;s too much addiction on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.520" end="00:08:04.480" style="s2">these days you could either change you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.680" end="00:08:07.000" style="s2">know some of a very small specific thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.480" end="00:08:08.620" style="s2">like maybe in the uxu say hey do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.000" end="00:08:10.420" style="s2">want to keep scrolling and now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.620" end="00:08:11.920" style="s2">really want to keep scrolling right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.420" end="00:08:14.140" style="s2">that&#39;s like a very small kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.920" end="00:08:15.400" style="s2">parameter base change or you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.140" end="00:08:17.770" style="s2">change the goals of the system</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.400" end="00:08:19.540" style="s2">so traditionally Facebook&#39;s main goal</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.770" end="00:08:21.400" style="s2">was engagement which is like time on</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.540" end="00:08:22.900" style="s2">site but then they changed it to be ah</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.400" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">let&#39;s change the goal would be time well</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.900" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">spent and when they changed to be time</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:29.410" style="s2">well spent that then change the goals</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:30.700" style="s2">the designers and everybody in Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.410" end="00:08:32.169" style="s2">to be like oh maybe we don&#39;t want people</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.700" end="00:08:35.020" style="s2">just be scrolling endlessly or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.169" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">or you go up even one level further and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.020" end="00:08:40.210" style="s2">go to something like social media as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:41.979" style="s2">utility and say hey this is thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.210" end="00:08:44.140" style="s2">it as a you know it&#39;s kind of a more of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.979" end="00:08:45.700" style="s2">a macro paradigmatic mindset change</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.140" end="00:08:48.220" style="s2">around what is Facebook should Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.700" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">be a you know is it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.220" end="00:08:51.790" style="s2">company that is driven to connect people</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:54.280" style="s2">or should we see it as you know a public</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.790" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">utility so that&#39;s an example of what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.280" end="00:08:58.180" style="s2">mean by paradigm change and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:09:00.610" style="s2">compare it to this thing by Lawrence</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.180" end="00:09:02.290" style="s2">Leslie called his pathetic dot and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.610" end="00:09:04.780" style="s2">has these four little it&#39;s these four</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.290" end="00:09:06.190" style="s2">little things here that are point</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.780" end="00:09:07.420" style="s2">this human the pathetic dot in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.190" end="00:09:09.220" style="s2">middle and there are the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.420" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2">incentives and kind of hidden defaults</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.220" end="00:09:12.670" style="s2">that can affect that person so with</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.050" end="00:09:14.770" style="s2">markets you can affect somebody you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.670" end="00:09:16.390" style="s2">incentivize things you can make laws you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.770" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">could change some norms you could like</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.390" end="00:09:19.510" style="s2">shame people for doing stuff or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.880" style="s2">if you if we&#39;re not wearing the masks or</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.510" end="00:09:24.190" style="s2">whatever or you can make some code and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:26.020" style="s2">those are all different ways to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.190" end="00:09:27.970" style="s2">incentivize someone to do stuff to like</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.020" end="00:09:29.110" style="s2">change behavior in the world and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.970" end="00:09:31.030" style="s2">like to think about this but where do</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.110" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">paradigms fit within this they exist</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.030" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">again one level above this so they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:38.890" style="s2">the paradigm is these underlying</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.560" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">mindsets that then get manifest in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.890" end="00:09:43.210" style="s2">laws in the markets in the norms or in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">the code okay so it&#39;s not the code</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.210" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">itself it&#39;s not the norms of self it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">like one level abstracted another way I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:50.890" style="s2">think about this is with institutions so</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.980" style="s2">you have religions or nation-states or</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.890" end="00:09:55.270" style="s2">companies and again those things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.980" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">manifestations they manifest the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.270" end="00:10:01.090" style="s2">paradigm but they are not the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:03.700" style="s2">in in them itself um so when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.090" end="00:10:05.710" style="s2">talk about post capitalism it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.700" end="00:10:08.950" style="s2">no one really knows what post capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.710" end="00:10:12.820" style="s2">means everybody knows that Lacy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.950" end="00:10:14.860" style="s2">capitalism is here with us but no one</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.820" end="00:10:16.300" style="s2">really knows what&#39;s next and so when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.860" end="00:10:18.010" style="s2">think about post capitalism I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.300" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">some folks will talk about it as an</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.010" end="00:10:22.270" style="s2">economic system i disagree with that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:24.790" style="s2">think that post capitalism i think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.270" end="00:10:26.710" style="s2">best way to frame it is as a mindset and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.790" end="00:10:29.560" style="s2">then that mindset will be manifest in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.710" end="00:10:31.330" style="s2">you know in its economic systems and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.560" end="00:10:33.430" style="s2">institutions and other things but really</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.330" end="00:10:35.950" style="s2">thinking of it as a mindset is the best</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.430" end="00:10:38.010" style="s2">way to process so we look later on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.950" end="00:10:41.410" style="s2">line the rest of today&#39;s talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.010" end="00:10:43.030" style="s2">post capitalism as a mindset is manifest</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.410" end="00:10:43.690" style="s2">it&#39;s again it&#39;s not a specific economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.030" end="00:10:45.940" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.690" end="00:10:47.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a paradigmatic or paradigm does</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.940" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">then being manifested a bunch of sub</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.500" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">things within society so with that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:55.870" style="s2">try some breakout rooms again so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:57.010" style="s2">gonna go into the rooms and this time</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.870" end="00:10:58.600" style="s2">instead of two minutes are gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.010" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">three minutes and first you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.600" end="00:11:01.690" style="s2">just chaff the other person about like</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.980" end="00:11:03.390" style="s2">you know check for understanding or</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.690" end="00:11:05.620" style="s2">critiques you&#39;re gonna be like hey I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.390" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">here&#39;s what I understood is this what</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.620" end="00:11:08.620" style="s2">you understood is this what resis saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll like say I didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.620" end="00:11:13.720" style="s2">get you here you can like type that into</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:14.950" style="s2">the Google Doc or you can critique you</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.720" end="00:11:16.900" style="s2">can be like I disagree with you I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.950" end="00:11:17.590" style="s2">that this is a bad way to view this or</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.900" end="00:11:19.570" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.590" end="00:11:21.340" style="s2">um if you want to here&#39;s this bonus</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.570" end="00:11:23.470" style="s2">question which is to give a historical</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.340" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">example of how paradigm or mindset</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.470" end="00:11:30.250" style="s2">change trickled down into the system so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:33.690" style="s2">again we&#39;re gonna break out into two</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.250" end="00:11:36.010" style="s2">rooms with everybody and let me actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.690" end="00:11:37.570" style="s2">let&#39;s do the same rooms for the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.010" end="00:11:39.010" style="s2">half and then we&#39;re gonna switch rooms</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.570" end="00:11:40.270" style="s2">for the actually no we&#39;re gonna you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.010" end="00:11:43.630" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna recreate the rooms every</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.270" end="00:11:47.880" style="s2">time that&#39;ll be that&#39;ll be more fun so</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.630" end="00:11:50.290" style="s2">let&#39;s do that with this and again on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.880" end="00:11:52.570" style="s2">Cova to on here you can see there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.290" end="00:11:54.310" style="s2">paradigms is the next big section here</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:35.579" style="s2">mean sure now that I have one um we came</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.420" end="00:15:35.579" style="s2">up with a couple of possible shifts</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.110" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">about 1:00 the the shift in norm around</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.839" end="00:15:47.009" style="s2">gay rights and the friend also the fall</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:50.579" style="s2">of the Berlin Wall and then shifts we</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.009" end="00:15:52.379" style="s2">were talking about the shifts relating</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.579" end="00:15:55.949" style="s2">to theism and atheism throughout our</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.379" end="00:15:57.420" style="s2">lifetimes but mostly I think we go to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.949" end="00:15:59.549" style="s2">lake hmm it&#39;s actually really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:02.369" style="s2">point out when the paradigm shift occur</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.549" end="00:16:03.629" style="s2">and whether they&#39;re happening in yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.369" end="00:16:05.819" style="s2">agree with that and the one thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.629" end="00:16:07.709" style="s2">add to that and especially one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.819" end="00:16:09.540" style="s2">think about strategically here&#39;s the gay</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.709" end="00:16:10.470" style="s2">rights one brings up there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.540" end="00:16:11.970" style="s2">different things that have changed in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.470" end="00:16:13.559" style="s2">our lifetimes whether it&#39;s gave right or</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.970" end="00:16:16.829" style="s2">like medical marijuana or things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.559" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">that and when you look at the curves or</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.829" end="00:16:21.629" style="s2">how much of those changes come as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:23.459" style="s2">result of how much of the changes come</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.629" end="00:16:25.350" style="s2">as a result of new people being born in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.459" end="00:16:27.629" style="s2">old people dying or as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.350" end="00:16:29.639" style="s2">mindset changes it actually looks like</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.629" end="00:16:31.230" style="s2">most of the changes are a result of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.639" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">the generational thing of old people</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.230" end="00:16:34.769" style="s2">dying and new people being born which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:36.629" style="s2">kind of sad because it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.769" end="00:16:37.829" style="s2">untrackable the problem where you just</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.629" end="00:16:39.929" style="s2">kind of need to wait for people to die</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.829" end="00:16:41.129" style="s2">and for new people to be born but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.929" end="00:16:42.360" style="s2">just a note a lot of these paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.129" end="00:16:44.429" style="s2">changes that they mostly happen just</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.360" end="00:16:45.779" style="s2">your generation it&#39;s it&#39;s also unclear</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.429" end="00:16:48.779" style="s2">whether something like gay rights is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.779" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">paradigm change because whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.779" end="00:16:52.559" style="s2">gay people should be allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.749" style="s2">married is still a question that existed</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.559" end="00:16:56.279" style="s2">within the previous paradigm it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.749" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">if we charted a whole new paradigm what</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.279" end="00:17:00.779" style="s2">Meredith marriage was and maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">would be a paradigm shift degree yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.779" end="00:17:03.509" style="s2">agree</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:05.699" style="s2">I think the takeaway for everybody here</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.509" end="00:17:06.870" style="s2">is just that when we think about what</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.699" end="00:17:08.730" style="s2">we&#39;re trying about today and as we</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.870" end="00:17:09.539" style="s2">switching to post capitalism or Gabey or</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.730" end="00:17:14.100" style="s2">whatever you want to call this thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.539" end="00:17:15.870" style="s2">that&#39;s up next for society the it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.100" end="00:17:18.829" style="s2">happening what we&#39;re gonna talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.870" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">mostly at that you know meta kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.829" end="00:17:23.100" style="s2">abstracted level so with that let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:26.970" style="s2">back to sharing the screen chat about</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.100" end="00:17:32.210" style="s2">some specifics today so let me go back</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.970" end="00:17:35.970" style="s2">over here button beautiful um and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.210" end="00:17:40.070" style="s2">yeah so now chatting about each of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.970" end="00:17:43.350" style="s2">four kind of sub buckets of network ISM</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.070" end="00:17:44.909" style="s2">coherent pluralism bento ism and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.350" end="00:17:46.770" style="s2">generosity I know that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.909" end="00:17:48.210" style="s2">terms in there but uh I want to give a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.770" end="00:17:51.630" style="s2">brief overview of them before you die</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.210" end="00:17:54.900" style="s2">so network ISM is just the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.630" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">we&#39;re moving from a centralized a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.900" end="00:17:58.410" style="s2">these centralized trusted institutions</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:00.060" style="s2">like banks and nation-states and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.410" end="00:18:02.310" style="s2">companies and things like that and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.060" end="00:18:04.140" style="s2">moving towards these distributed</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.310" end="00:18:05.910" style="s2">networks bottom-up institutions and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.140" end="00:18:07.740" style="s2">is mainly as a result of there being</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.910" end="00:18:08.670" style="s2">four billion networks smartphones out</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.740" end="00:18:10.620" style="s2">there where you can give and receive</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.670" end="00:18:12.050" style="s2">information at zero marginal cost and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.620" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">sort of seeing all these new networks</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.050" end="00:18:18.870" style="s2">the second one is coherent pluralism and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:20.370" style="s2">the idea here is instead of being now</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.870" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a result it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.370" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">reaction to network ISM so when we live</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:24.390" style="s2">in a sense making environment an</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:27.180" style="s2">information environment of lots of</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.180" end="00:18:31.290" style="s2">or TV you have to consume a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.860" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">fertile istic different sources and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.290" end="00:18:33.930" style="s2">try to create coherence among them so</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:37.590" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a responsible</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.930" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">individuals reaction to network ISM the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.590" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">third one is called bento ISM and bento</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:46.890" style="s2">ISM the idea here is that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.920" end="00:18:48.690" style="s2">it&#39;s this little 2x2 and it&#39;s a it has</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.890" end="00:18:50.940" style="s2">the ideas that we&#39;re moving from this</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.690" end="00:18:52.410" style="s2">bottom left corner now me where you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.940" end="00:18:54.660" style="s2">kind of zoom out from our now me</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.410" end="00:18:56.850" style="s2">focusing just on me perspective and zoom</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.660" end="00:18:58.800" style="s2">out for me to think about a future me to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.850" end="00:19:00.330" style="s2">think about you know now us and to think</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.800" end="00:19:01.020" style="s2">about future us and climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.330" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.020" end="00:19:06.030" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of thinking about our needs in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:08.520" style="s2">society and then the fourth one is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.030" end="00:19:11.580" style="s2">generosity and the generosity or</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.520" end="00:19:13.460" style="s2">abundance and the idea here is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.580" end="00:19:15.870" style="s2">kind of this shift where we recognize</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.460" end="00:19:17.430" style="s2">bro now me perspective that some of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.870" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">have enough that we have enough and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.430" end="00:19:21.930" style="s2">we can then give to future us and we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:24.180" style="s2">give to others in the system so those</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.930" end="00:19:27.630" style="s2">are kind of the four made the four key</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.180" end="00:19:29.370" style="s2">pieces of this new mindset and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.630" end="00:19:31.830" style="s2">talk about how each of them is embodied</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.370" end="00:19:36.330" style="s2">in our response to kovat so if that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.830" end="00:19:37.950" style="s2">tried about network ISM first and so as</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.330" end="00:19:40.500" style="s2">a reminder this would network ISM it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.950" end="00:19:42.840" style="s2">and you can see it in these funny</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.500" end="00:19:45.570" style="s2">Twitter comments this these new</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.840" end="00:19:48.870" style="s2">networked institutions where top left</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.570" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2">like hey a $10 override is a lot cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.870" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">than $3,000 from an ambulance that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.420" end="00:19:55.170" style="s2">after a result of people you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:56.670" style="s2">calling ubers instead of to be taken to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.170" end="00:19:58.620" style="s2">the emergency room instead of ambulances</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.670" end="00:20:01.110" style="s2">or this bottom left one it&#39;s like hey</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.620" end="00:20:01.700" style="s2">how long until GoFundMe is our nation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.110" end="00:20:04.070" style="s2">leading health</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.700" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">provider that&#39;s kind of funny but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.070" end="00:20:07.610" style="s2">also kind of sad it&#39;s also just true or</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:09.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a good way for us inside</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.610" end="00:20:09.470" style="s2">like help or to go to help each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.110" end="00:20:11.659" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.470" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">by using this networked funding</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.659" end="00:20:16.549" style="s2">mechanism for folks with health care and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:18.350" style="s2">then this final one it says what if</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.549" end="00:20:19.010" style="s2">public infrastructure was funded by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.350" end="00:20:20.600" style="s2">crowd</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.010" end="00:20:22.309" style="s2">wow what a crazy idea that&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.600" end="00:20:24.289" style="s2">new networked idea where you you crowd</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.309" end="00:20:26.809" style="s2">funds of any things and putting that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.289" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">against or as some would call it taxes</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.809" end="00:20:29.990" style="s2">like that&#39;s not a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">centralized way to fund public</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.990" end="00:20:35.059" style="s2">infrastructure so these all kind of show</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:36.860" style="s2">this move towards network ISM and I want</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.059" end="00:20:38.600" style="s2">to talk about how our response to Co vid</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.860" end="00:20:40.460" style="s2">embodies that so I&#39;m gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.600" end="00:20:42.260" style="s2">three different things here one is from</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.460" end="00:20:44.419" style="s2">an information perspective two is from a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.260" end="00:20:46.909" style="s2">money perspective and three is from an</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.419" end="00:20:49.330" style="s2">institutional perspective so from an</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.909" end="00:20:51.260" style="s2">information perspective the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.330" end="00:20:53.000" style="s2">centralized version of things here is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.260" end="00:20:55.820" style="s2">like main media or mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.000" end="00:21:00.049" style="s2">while the non centralized version is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.820" end="00:21:03.830" style="s2">networked influencers and I want to show</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.049" end="00:21:06.200" style="s2">let&#39;s make this big again so on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.830" end="00:21:07.490" style="s2">centralized side we saw it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.200" end="00:21:09.320" style="s2">interesting to see what happens here</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.490" end="00:21:10.970" style="s2">there&#39;s this recent piece from recode</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.320" end="00:21:12.980" style="s2">that says what went wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.970" end="00:21:15.799" style="s2">media&#39;s coronavirus coverage and can we</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.980" end="00:21:17.179" style="s2">do better is kind of just like in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.799" end="00:21:19.190" style="s2">when a bunch of folks were being like</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.179" end="00:21:21.169" style="s2">whoa wow Trump got elected we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.190" end="00:21:23.960" style="s2">surprised and there were a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.169" end="00:21:25.669" style="s2">post-mortems after that and as you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.960" end="00:21:26.990" style="s2">see here there&#39;s this like this image at</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.669" end="00:21:29.269" style="s2">the bottom is just a bunch of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.990" end="00:21:31.100" style="s2">mainstream media sites talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.269" end="00:21:32.870" style="s2">coronavirus and you know January</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.100" end="00:21:34.789" style="s2">February March and just like dismissing</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.870" end="00:21:36.409" style="s2">it essentially and the issue in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.789" end="00:21:38.750" style="s2">article the main thing I won&#39;t have here</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.409" end="00:21:41.870" style="s2">is that when journalists and media</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.750" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">sourced things they sourced stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.870" end="00:21:46.580" style="s2">credentialed experts and institutions</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:48.200" style="s2">which traditionally had been good but</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.580" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">actually if you&#39;re asking the CBC if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.200" end="00:21:52.039" style="s2">should wear masks X amount of time ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:54.590" style="s2">and they would still just say no no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.039" end="00:21:55.850" style="s2">and so that was um one of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.590" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">with kind of like the centralized sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.850" end="00:22:01.970" style="s2">making versus on the other side here you</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:22:06.289" style="s2">have this new decent license making and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.970" end="00:22:09.320" style="s2">the idea here this graph is from this</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.289" end="00:22:11.059" style="s2">graph is from strategy and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.320" end="00:22:13.070" style="s2">now that we have now that the marginal</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.059" end="00:22:14.500" style="s2">cost is zero to copy and distribute</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.070" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">information all around the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.500" end="00:22:17.620" style="s2">we just have a lot more information a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:20.140" style="s2">lot of information is in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.620" end="00:22:21.700" style="s2">ground here with just like you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.140" end="00:22:23.050" style="s2">average information some that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.700" end="00:22:24.280" style="s2">information is obviously bad it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.050" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">misinformation but some of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.280" end="00:22:28.510" style="s2">information is super valuable and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:30.310" style="s2">what happened is Twitter and other</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.510" end="00:22:32.710" style="s2">universes what they did is they were</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.310" end="00:22:33.910" style="s2">able to source the information and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.710" end="00:22:35.580" style="s2">know the valuable information more</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.910" end="00:22:37.630" style="s2">quickly kind of from first principles</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.580" end="00:22:38.860" style="s2">through this kind of decent choice and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.630" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">network on Twitter so you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.860" end="00:22:42.490" style="s2">see those two responses and sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:44.950" style="s2">to something like the coronavirus here</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.490" end="00:22:48.060" style="s2">that&#39;s on the infant information side on</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.950" end="00:22:50.830" style="s2">the money side about this more with</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.060" end="00:22:52.600" style="s2">generosity later and money there but</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.830" end="00:22:54.190" style="s2">easy way to look at this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.600" end="00:22:56.890" style="s2">top-down stimulus versus bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.190" end="00:22:59.740" style="s2">network grants so the top-down stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.890" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">this is a some pseudocode I wrote for</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.740" end="00:23:05.470" style="s2">the for the US stimulus package which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:06.940" style="s2">two trillion dollars and essentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.470" end="00:23:08.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a very top-down seeing like a state</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.940" end="00:23:11.050" style="s2">perspective or just like hey for every</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.620" end="00:23:14.470" style="s2">person give them $1,200 or you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.050" end="00:23:16.030" style="s2">create $1,200 out of thin air and give</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.470" end="00:23:18.070" style="s2">them if they are not employed give them</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.800" end="00:23:42.190" style="s2">in the federal count that you can loan</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.360" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">out at 10x to anybody else that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.190" end="00:23:45.640" style="s2">of like the seeing like a state top-down</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:47.140" style="s2">money perspective and that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.640" end="00:23:49.090" style="s2">than you know this bottom-up perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.140" end="00:23:51.130" style="s2">which is like okay this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.090" end="00:23:53.020" style="s2">fast grants which was fast funding for</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.130" end="00:23:54.730" style="s2">science and they just got together</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.020" end="00:23:56.680" style="s2">really quick they said hey here&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.730" end="00:23:58.840" style="s2">million bucks we&#39;ll get to you in 48</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.840" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">the money and so just a much kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:03.880" style="s2">those kind of Institute&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.900" end="00:24:06.940" style="s2">bottom-up quick way to fund science that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.880" end="00:24:09.280" style="s2">we need so that&#39;s one way to look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.940" end="00:24:10.630" style="s2">this the final way is from an</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.280" end="00:24:12.160" style="s2">institutional perspective and what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.630" end="00:24:14.260" style="s2">mean here is when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.160" end="00:24:17.560" style="s2">institutions there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.260" end="00:24:18.760" style="s2">coordinate and motivate people and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.560" end="00:24:20.800" style="s2">coordination usually comes from</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.760" end="00:24:21.880" style="s2">information and the motivation usually</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.800" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">comes from money so those two things</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.880" end="00:24:26.560" style="s2">combined kind of make an institution and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:28.050" style="s2">on I want to show like some companies</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.560" end="00:24:30.540" style="s2">that are centralized and then some</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.050" end="00:24:33.180" style="s2">new networked orgs as some decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.540" end="00:24:35.190" style="s2">examples so on the centralized side you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.180" end="00:24:37.830" style="s2">have something like 3m which makes masks</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.190" end="00:24:39.150" style="s2">and it&#39;s free sweet they&#39;re making they</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.830" end="00:24:40.770" style="s2">doubled their mass production the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.150" end="00:24:42.570" style="s2">you know three to six months and now</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.770" end="00:24:44.610" style="s2">they&#39;re moving up to 25 million masks</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.570" end="00:24:46.290" style="s2">per week which is a lot and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.610" end="00:24:47.430" style="s2">obviously a very old company and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.290" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">first is this kind of decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.430" end="00:24:51.720" style="s2">response which is this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.550" style="s2">open-source kovat medical supplies which</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.720" end="00:24:55.470" style="s2">is just a random you know Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.550" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">it has 70,000 people in it and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.470" end="00:24:59.400" style="s2">making a million masks per week which</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:02.550" style="s2">you know is only is you know four</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.400" end="00:25:04.920" style="s2">percent of what 3m is making but it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.550" end="00:25:08.460" style="s2">they were they&#39;re actually increasing at</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.920" end="00:25:12.300" style="s2">2x 2.5 x per week and they were founded</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.460" end="00:25:13.290" style="s2">just recently and obviously I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.300" end="00:25:15.990" style="s2">would I want to highlight here is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.290" end="00:25:17.790" style="s2">they were also founded Facebook as the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.990" end="00:25:19.320" style="s2">thing barely existed ten years ago 3d</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.790" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">printing as a thing barely existed 10</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.320" end="00:25:23.790" style="s2">years ago and so when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:26.100" style="s2">these two these are two different</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.790" end="00:25:27.660" style="s2">responses institutional responses here</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.100" end="00:25:30.150" style="s2">and I think that obviously it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.660" end="00:25:32.340" style="s2">case that open source code medical</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.150" end="00:25:33.750" style="s2">medical supplies was it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.340" end="00:25:35.130" style="s2">compare them and obviously the one on</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.750" end="00:25:37.680" style="s2">the right is like worst quote unquote</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.130" end="00:25:39.180" style="s2">but it&#39;s just new it&#39;s just an emerging</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.680" end="00:25:42.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like a proto example what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.180" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">starting to see here another one is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.540" end="00:25:46.770" style="s2">masks for all movement so I asked folks</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:48.450" style="s2">on Twitter hey did mask for actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.770" end="00:25:51.150" style="s2">have an impact on the CDC&#39;s announcement</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.450" end="00:25:52.770" style="s2">and I was like almost certainly it CDC</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.150" end="00:25:54.840" style="s2">made a decision without thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.770" end="00:25:57.000" style="s2">the hash tag or the movement but one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.840" end="00:25:58.590" style="s2">the main leaders of mask sprawl actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.000" end="00:25:59.640" style="s2">replied said yes it did I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.590" end="00:26:01.530" style="s2">first-hand knowledge so he was like</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.640" end="00:26:03.330" style="s2">actually master all was a pretty like</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.530" end="00:26:05.550" style="s2">the hash that weirdly like the hash tag</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.330" end="00:26:07.920" style="s2">itself was helpful in changing the CDC</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.550" end="00:26:10.620" style="s2">decisions like that&#39;s weird right he</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.920" end="00:26:12.300" style="s2">says you know by hash tag he means you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.620" end="00:26:13.680" style="s2">know many hours of pitching and briefing</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.300" end="00:26:15.300" style="s2">politicians and their teams know similar</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.680" end="00:26:17.130" style="s2">legwork so it&#39;s obviously not just like</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.300" end="00:26:19.740" style="s2">CDC saw a hash tag was like sweet let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.130" end="00:26:21.210" style="s2">make masks for all but the mask for all</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.740" end="00:26:23.880" style="s2">movement was definitely a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.210" end="00:26:25.230" style="s2">that shift so that&#39;s another example</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.880" end="00:26:28.530" style="s2">there are other really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.230" end="00:26:32.250" style="s2">things like hash tag get us PPE and get</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.530" end="00:26:33.240" style="s2">us TPP which you know combined abundant</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.250" end="00:26:35.640" style="s2">was a clearinghouse for a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.240" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">PPE marketplaces st. Corona fires tech</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.640" end="00:26:40.440" style="s2">handbook was an amazing handbook that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.970" style="s2">was coming up at very</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.440" end="00:26:43.560" style="s2">that just had permissions on for</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.970" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">everybody and anybody could add to it on</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.560" end="00:26:49.680" style="s2">so again these bottom up responses to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:51.690" style="s2">this versus the top down so with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.680" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">you can see these as all from an</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.690" end="00:26:54.210" style="s2">information perspective from a money</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.980" end="00:26:55.860" style="s2">perspective or an institutional</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.210" end="00:26:57.960" style="s2">perspective there&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.860" end="00:26:59.040" style="s2">traditional centralized response and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.960" end="00:27:01.740" style="s2">then there&#39;s the bottom-up networked</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.040" end="00:27:03.990" style="s2">response and with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.740" end="00:27:05.700" style="s2">yeah the network ISM more generally is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.990" end="00:27:07.710" style="s2">just this trend in these new</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.700" end="00:27:09.210" style="s2">decentralized institutions out competing</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.710" end="00:27:11.550" style="s2">not on everything but out competing on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.210" end="00:27:14.310" style="s2">variety of facets some of these old and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.550" end="00:27:16.440" style="s2">centralized institutions so with that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.310" end="00:27:18.210" style="s2">are going to go into our sessions into</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.440" end="00:27:20.550" style="s2">our breakout rooms and I will make sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.210" end="00:27:23.880" style="s2">not to mess it up this time by trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.550" end="00:27:25.470" style="s2">go into one so again let&#39;s say you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.880" end="00:27:26.910" style="s2">two or three minutes here and discuss</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.470" end="00:27:28.890" style="s2">again what do you think about this just</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.910" end="00:27:30.140" style="s2">check for understanding or critique and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.890" end="00:27:32.040" style="s2">then this interesting question here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.140" end="00:27:34.800" style="s2">you know if we&#39;ve seen a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.040" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">hashtags show up hashtag is SPE hashtag</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.800" end="00:27:38.250" style="s2">masks for all you know hash tag cloud</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:40.410" style="s2">the curve what hashtags would you expect</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.250" end="00:27:42.060" style="s2">to gain traction in the next 12 months</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.410" end="00:27:47.820" style="s2">of CO vid that would that&#39;s like one way</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.060" end="00:27:50.520" style="s2">to view this so with that hello</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.820" end="00:27:52.770" style="s2">everybody and welcome back I hope you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.520" end="00:27:55.020" style="s2">chatted about network ISM we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.770" end="00:27:58.590" style="s2">zoom right into coherent pluralism now</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.020" end="00:28:00.780" style="s2">um and so let me go back to sharing my</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.590" end="00:28:04.620" style="s2">screen there&#39;s my time or beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.780" end="00:28:07.020" style="s2">timing you know so the next one is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.620" end="00:28:10.740" style="s2">coherent Thurl ism and the idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.020" end="00:28:14.730" style="s2">coherent pluralism is that it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.740" end="00:28:16.170" style="s2">the the correct response to a networked</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.730" end="00:28:19.470" style="s2">environments to a network sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.170" end="00:28:20.700" style="s2">environment so here&#39;s John Lennon with</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.470" end="00:28:21.750" style="s2">some classes that CD you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.700" end="00:28:24.810" style="s2">putting on a bunch of these different</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.750" end="00:28:26.340" style="s2">glasses in order to create a plural</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.810" end="00:28:27.630" style="s2">perspective but still a coherent one I</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.340" end="00:28:29.160" style="s2">just want to share this picture on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.630" end="00:28:31.170" style="s2">right is from this piece that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.160" end="00:28:32.580" style="s2">writing right now and I am having</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.170" end="00:28:34.920" style="s2">someone illustrate it and that is how</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.580" end="00:28:38.910" style="s2">she represented coherent plurals which</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.920" end="00:28:42.060" style="s2">is cool so the idea here is that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.910" end="00:28:43.350" style="s2">think of this from over the last couple</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.060" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">hundred years perspective where you had</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.350" end="00:28:48.090" style="s2">this modernism&#39;s modernism thing which</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:49.560" style="s2">is like hey here&#39;s the truth nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.090" end="00:28:50.010" style="s2">and patriotism like broadcasting the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.560" end="00:28:51.720" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.010" end="00:28:53.970" style="s2">top-down you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.720" end="00:28:56.580" style="s2">broadcasting through the TV through</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.970" end="00:28:58.740" style="s2">radio that perspective it&#39;s one one lens</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.580" end="00:29:00.059" style="s2">then you have like this post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.740" end="00:29:02.309" style="s2">perspective for this fake news</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.059" end="00:29:04.260" style="s2">perspective which is maybe I have my red</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.309" end="00:29:05.940" style="s2">feed maybe I have my blue feed you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:07.860" style="s2">what I don&#39;t really know what is true</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.940" end="00:29:09.450" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna be super pluralistic and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.860" end="00:29:12.120" style="s2">I&#39;m not there is no truth there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.450" end="00:29:13.289" style="s2">fake news what is even real and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.120" end="00:29:14.520" style="s2">not right either</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.289" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">and so what you want is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.520" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">meta modernist perspective or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:20.460" style="s2">just another name for coherent pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.590" style="s2">which is to have multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.460" end="00:29:24.030" style="s2">glasses you&#39;re putting on to view things</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.590" end="00:29:26.429" style="s2">in pluralistic way but then create</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.030" end="00:29:28.380" style="s2">coherence among them um so again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.429" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">how responsible individuals do since</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.380" end="00:29:32.700" style="s2">making given network ISM and again</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:34.260" style="s2">here&#39;s I kind of a way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.700" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">is like if you think about that first</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.260" end="00:29:37.950" style="s2">thing on the left you have me praying at</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:40.110" style="s2">this point again on the left here you</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.950" end="00:29:41.340" style="s2">have if you&#39;re just consuming from one</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.110" end="00:29:42.630" style="s2">source and maybe you&#39;re consuming from</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.340" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">one of these sources then you might have</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.630" end="00:29:46.860" style="s2">thought something about Co fit that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:49.080" style="s2">just wrong or whatever but you also</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.860" end="00:29:50.610" style="s2">can&#39;t do this middle perspective here</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.080" end="00:29:52.260" style="s2">which is just like oh here&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.610" end="00:29:53.730" style="s2">information but not put these</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.260" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">misinformation and valuable information</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.730" end="00:29:56.909" style="s2">things there&#39;s like there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.980" style="s2">information whatever there&#39;s no truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.909" end="00:30:00.150" style="s2">anymore everything&#39;s fake news and but</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.980" end="00:30:01.080" style="s2">the third perspectives what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.150" end="00:30:03.240" style="s2">have which has traits it&#39;s plural</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.080" end="00:30:04.830" style="s2">perspective where you look at as many</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.240" end="00:30:07.470" style="s2">things as you can and then create an</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.830" end="00:30:10.710" style="s2">answer from that so when I kind of show</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:12.720" style="s2">it in two big ways here with searching</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.710" end="00:30:14.429" style="s2">for truth while existing and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.720" end="00:30:16.770" style="s2">but then also through empathy</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.429" end="00:30:18.150" style="s2">so the searching through for truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.770" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">existing uncertainty that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.150" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">vibe of coherent literalism it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:22.679" style="s2">this constant relentless search for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:26.309" style="s2">truth while still things are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.679" end="00:30:28.650" style="s2">uncertain so the example here is from</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.309" end="00:30:30.750" style="s2">538 and I&#39;m just gonna read this because</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.650" end="00:30:32.460" style="s2">it really gets at this from a recent</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.750" end="00:30:33.690" style="s2">post they had about masks and just</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.460" end="00:30:36.090" style="s2">really gets at what it needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.690" end="00:30:38.850" style="s2">coherent plural individual so Maggie</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.090" end="00:30:40.590" style="s2">writes ultimately the expert advice on</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.850" end="00:30:43.020" style="s2">masks is to get comfortable with not</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.590" end="00:30:45.270" style="s2">knowing the right answer you can and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.020" end="00:30:47.429" style="s2">should have some trusted advisors you</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.270" end="00:30:49.049" style="s2">can and should read up on why certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.429" end="00:30:50.820" style="s2">things are or are not being recommended</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.049" end="00:30:52.530" style="s2">but there are a lot of issues around</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.820" end="00:30:53.789" style="s2">this fire so much two experts can read</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.530" end="00:30:55.950" style="s2">the same data and come to different</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.789" end="00:30:58.200" style="s2">conclusions for the rest of us that just</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.950" end="00:30:59.460" style="s2">means accepting that sometimes we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.200" end="00:31:02.070" style="s2">just have to do the best we can without</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.460" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">a clear set of instructions that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.070" end="00:31:04.920" style="s2">situation your your being coherent lis</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:06.870" style="s2">plural your</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.920" end="00:31:08.310" style="s2">having trust advisors and sources and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.870" end="00:31:10.200" style="s2">then you&#39;re just doing the best you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.310" end="00:31:12.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what come here pluralism is like</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.200" end="00:31:15.240" style="s2">the other version of coherent portal ISM</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.120" end="00:31:17.760" style="s2">is this is there just um pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.240" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">looking at like facts there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:22.320" style="s2">a pluralist viewpoint was like empathy</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:25.050" style="s2">other humans um and so this was this</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:26.970" style="s2">great video that Italy put out ten days</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.050" end="00:31:29.610" style="s2">before when they were in an intense</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.970" end="00:31:31.260" style="s2">situation before the US was and so they</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.610" end="00:31:34.260" style="s2">made this beautiful video where they</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.260" end="00:31:35.670" style="s2">just went around and they said um where</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.260" end="00:31:38.190" style="s2">it was just individuals on their phones</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.670" end="00:31:40.350" style="s2">kind of stitched together saying these</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.190" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">these nice messages where&#39;s like hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.350" end="00:31:44.400" style="s2">Danielle from ten days ago hey a huge</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:45.660" style="s2">mess is about to happen you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.400" end="00:31:48.090" style="s2">a two thousand there are eighteen</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.660" end="00:31:50.040" style="s2">thousand I used to make fun of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.090" end="00:31:52.020" style="s2">wearing face masks but now we&#39;re like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.040" end="00:31:53.370" style="s2">whole nation stuck at home but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.020" end="00:31:55.350" style="s2">still good stuff like yesterday when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.370" end="00:31:56.730" style="s2">got out on our balconies but really stay</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.350" end="00:31:58.350" style="s2">at home like don&#39;t you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.730" end="00:32:00.750" style="s2">serious stuff I thought this was a great</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.350" end="00:32:02.580" style="s2">example of again an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.750" end="00:32:04.140" style="s2">you can where everybody has smartphones</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.580" end="00:32:05.880" style="s2">four billion networked smartphones you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.140" end="00:32:07.470" style="s2">can make information like this directly</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.880" end="00:32:08.730" style="s2">from people&#39;s phones and we can really</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.470" end="00:32:10.560" style="s2">empathize with these folks and for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.730" end="00:32:12.150" style="s2">this is when most powerful pieces of of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.560" end="00:32:13.350" style="s2">this thing was seeing this addition to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.150" end="00:32:15.180" style="s2">me like wow that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.350" end="00:32:18.870" style="s2">to the US and other places around the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.180" end="00:32:21.540" style="s2">world that&#39;s really powerful so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.870" end="00:32:24.300" style="s2">what cohered pluralism is so again</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.540" end="00:32:27.150" style="s2">within your groups let&#39;s have some folks</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.300" end="00:32:28.500" style="s2">and I think that the again feel free to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.150" end="00:32:30.600" style="s2">you know check with each other on</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.500" end="00:32:33.060" style="s2">questions and critique and then the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.600" end="00:32:35.190" style="s2">question here is how coherently plural</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.060" end="00:32:37.380" style="s2">is your sense making right now could it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.190" end="00:32:39.030" style="s2">be more coherent akru just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.380" end="00:32:41.460" style="s2">existing in seas of information without</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.030" end="00:32:43.170" style="s2">any coherence but could also be more</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.460" end="00:32:45.090" style="s2">plural so maybe you don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.170" end="00:32:47.520" style="s2">sources or you&#39;re not looking from as</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.090" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">many perspectives as you should so with</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.520" end="00:32:55.800" style="s2">that let&#39;s do this thing open up these</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:58.040" style="s2">breakout rooms recreate um okay enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.800" end="00:33:00.540" style="s2">your broom see in two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.040" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s actually we&#39;re gonna keep zooming</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.540" end="00:33:05.270" style="s2">we got a we have nine more minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:08.250" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna keep zooming and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.270" end="00:33:10.980" style="s2">literally actually zooming so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.250" end="00:33:13.620" style="s2">going into the next one here which is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.980" end="00:33:18.150" style="s2">bento ism so been to ism is a cool</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.620" end="00:33:21.960" style="s2">concept and just as a note here</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.150" end="00:33:23.160" style="s2">so is made by its from my friend Yancy</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.960" end="00:33:25.530" style="s2">strickler&#39;s book this could be our</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.160" end="00:33:27.570" style="s2">future and just for full disclosure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.530" end="00:33:30.120" style="s2">like working with Nancy on this so I am</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.120" end="00:33:34.560" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s good and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.060" end="00:33:35.880" style="s2">that you have I like to think it from a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.560" end="00:33:37.710" style="s2">needs perspective where you have in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.880" end="00:33:40.410" style="s2">bottom left corner here you have your</p>

<p begin="00:35:03.810" end="00:35:07.500" style="s2">really felt this too or they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.860" end="00:35:09.630" style="s2">well like meaning in life this has</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.500" end="00:35:11.310" style="s2">really changed like their directions and</p>

<p begin="00:35:11.310" end="00:35:14.370" style="s2">go and kind of like their laws of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:16.170" style="s2">adjacent possible what what is possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.370" end="00:35:17.490" style="s2">for the future on the now us this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.170" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">really showing us how interconnected we</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.490" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">are this is just a graph of all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:22.980" style="s2">places the the virus went at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.460" end="00:35:24.420" style="s2">beginning and then from a futurist</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.980" end="00:35:25.740" style="s2">perspective obviously stuff like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.420" end="00:35:27.510" style="s2">know flattening the curve has really</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.740" end="00:35:28.980" style="s2">made us be like okay I need to stay</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.510" end="00:35:31.290" style="s2">inside now so that you know in a month</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.980" end="00:35:31.470" style="s2">or two you know things aren&#39;t overloaded</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.290" end="00:35:33.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.470" end="00:35:35.910" style="s2">and by within my city so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.960" end="00:35:37.230" style="s2">perspective but I want I think the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.910" end="00:35:39.869" style="s2">important thing here is actually just</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.230" end="00:35:41.460" style="s2">like how the virus gives us a blank</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.869" end="00:35:45.210" style="s2">slate and shows us that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.460" end="00:35:48.060" style="s2">change how we think about ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.210" end="00:35:49.590" style="s2">our humanity&#39;s needs so um you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.060" end="00:35:51.090" style="s2">generally speaking we have exists on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.590" end="00:35:52.920" style="s2">left side here if you know you know more</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.090" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">focused on now me and what this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.920" end="00:35:56.760" style="s2">of doing is you know giving us this more</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:35:59.580" style="s2">holistic perspective towards the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.760" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">general bento box so you can see this in</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.580" end="00:36:02.460" style="s2">consumer spending um</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:04.590" style="s2">this graph from New York Times about</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.460" end="00:36:05.820" style="s2">just how you know spending going up and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.590" end="00:36:07.349" style="s2">down for various things but uh sit down</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.820" end="00:36:09.630" style="s2">for variety of things where people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.349" end="00:36:11.099" style="s2">responding to the event so they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.630" end="00:36:13.050" style="s2">of changing their needs the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.099" end="00:36:15.420" style="s2">example obviously is something here like</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.050" end="00:36:17.550" style="s2">the total amount of tests we&#39;ve had for</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.420" end="00:36:19.140" style="s2">Coppa this is in the u.s. it&#39;s gone you</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.550" end="00:36:21.090" style="s2">know now we&#39;re making made 3 million</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.140" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">total tests and this is again this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.090" end="00:36:25.140" style="s2">like the wartime production side or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:26.910" style="s2">plowshares two swords side where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.140" end="00:36:28.500" style="s2">taken these things that have normally</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.910" end="00:36:30.270" style="s2">done a certain kind of thing for society</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.500" end="00:36:31.890" style="s2">and you said hey let&#39;s actually change</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.270" end="00:36:35.820" style="s2">them to be due to this other good thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.890" end="00:36:38.849" style="s2">for society so I like to think of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.820" end="00:36:41.490" style="s2">as a graph of the stock market and</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.849" end="00:36:42.869" style="s2">obviously and it was going down and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.490" end="00:36:45.060" style="s2">gonna come back up and so it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.869" end="00:36:47.099" style="s2">look like a check mark on what timeline</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.060" end="00:36:48.869" style="s2">we don&#39;t know but I like I think think</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.099" end="00:36:49.950" style="s2">about as the check mark is not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.869" end="00:36:51.540" style="s2">correct I think you have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.950" end="00:36:53.190" style="s2">instead of just the X and the y-axis</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.540" end="00:36:55.560" style="s2">here you could also think about the z</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.190" end="00:36:57.570" style="s2">axis and the z axis is really what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.560" end="00:37:00.240" style="s2">talking about where the z axis the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.570" end="00:37:03.300" style="s2">question is how much is that z axis</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.240" end="00:37:05.430" style="s2">going to be focused again on stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.300" end="00:37:06.690" style="s2">you know our old way of doing things you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.430" end="00:37:08.609" style="s2">know this now me focus way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.690" end="00:37:09.990" style="s2">things versus shifting towards more of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.609" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">kind of a future us way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.990" end="00:37:13.140" style="s2">and whether or not do you agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:15.240" style="s2">or don&#39;t agree with it the like green</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.140" end="00:37:17.010" style="s2">new deal green stimulus is trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.240" end="00:37:19.619" style="s2">at this idea and saying hey as we</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.010" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">rebuild and as we you know try to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.619" end="00:37:22.890" style="s2">things differently going forwards how</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:25.589" style="s2">come they could be you know more focused</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.890" end="00:37:28.109" style="s2">on future us um as a funny example this</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.589" end="00:37:30.180" style="s2">like you know my friend John on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.109" end="00:37:32.280" style="s2">was saying hey wow look at that rise in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.180" end="00:37:35.099" style="s2">covert 19 cases and things like oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.280" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">that&#39;s just global co2 never mind no</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.099" end="00:37:38.990" style="s2">need to do anything I thought this was</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:41.099" style="s2">funny and sad where it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.990" end="00:37:42.750" style="s2">obviously for a lot of us we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.099" end="00:37:43.890" style="s2">this with covent be like Oh God and now</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.750" end="00:37:45.480" style="s2">we&#39;re doing at least intense measures</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.890" end="00:37:47.670" style="s2">and obviously you have not</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.480" end="00:37:49.500" style="s2">done that in society yet with stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.670" end="00:37:51.810" style="s2">climate change we don&#39;t have those that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.500" end="00:37:53.550" style="s2">feedback tightly coupled enough yet so</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.810" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s hope is that we moved</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.550" end="00:37:58.470" style="s2">towards a box of bright more so again</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.510" style="s2">been to ISM it&#39;s just it&#39;s a nice just</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.470" end="00:38:02.970" style="s2">another a lens of viewing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.510" end="00:38:05.640" style="s2">it really helps us understand humanity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.970" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">needs and that we can actually change</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.640" end="00:38:09.869" style="s2">them and this crisis has showed us that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">we can that during the crisis itself we</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.869" end="00:38:13.560" style="s2">can change our needs we can go into</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:14.730" style="s2">wartime production mode and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.560" end="00:38:17.130" style="s2">what it&#39;ll show us is that we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.730" end="00:38:19.050" style="s2">of move towards more of these future us</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.130" end="00:38:21.150" style="s2">facing perspectives as we kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.050" end="00:38:23.220" style="s2">out of the crisis so with that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.150" end="00:38:25.260" style="s2">gonna go into some groups and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.220" end="00:38:27.390" style="s2">that what I want you to do is you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.260" end="00:38:29.340" style="s2">ask the question how does your own bento</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.390" end="00:38:31.980" style="s2">box respond to the question what should</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.340" end="00:38:33.990" style="s2">I do in these Cobie times so you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.980" end="00:38:35.820" style="s2">your own but I could say well my future</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.990" end="00:38:38.130" style="s2">me self says this but my you know future</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.820" end="00:38:39.420" style="s2">us self says this or whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.130" end="00:38:41.369" style="s2">kind of so you could gotta walk through</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.420" end="00:38:43.830" style="s2">those different pieces um so with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.369" end="00:38:47.510" style="s2">let&#39;s put you all into groups were</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.830" end="00:38:49.380" style="s2">really grounded it just start naming the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.510" end="00:38:51.600" style="s2">arenas and the Freak</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.380" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">where are the breakdowns and what what</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.600" end="00:38:58.500" style="s2">are the adjacent possible yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:39:01.350" style="s2">like that that was the meet us or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.500" end="00:39:04.530" style="s2">now actually was future us that we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.350" end="00:39:05.910" style="s2">into yeah that makes sense everybody we</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.530" end="00:39:07.350" style="s2">were just chatting with Nancy for a hot</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.910" end="00:39:09.300" style="s2">SEC about how they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.350" end="00:39:11.550" style="s2">Nancy saying how can you just break down</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.300" end="00:39:13.380" style="s2">to break through and to think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.550" end="00:39:14.970" style="s2">those laws of the jacent possible I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.380" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go into our final little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.970" end="00:39:20.130" style="s2">here um and then and then we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.510" style="s2">have a little bit of time dance either</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.160" end="00:39:37.890" style="s2">can chat for a bit so the final piece</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:40.710" style="s2">here is generosity and so generosity the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.890" end="00:39:44.040" style="s2">idea generosity or abundance and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.710" end="00:39:46.740" style="s2">idea here is that for for some of us and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.040" end="00:39:49.530" style="s2">I&#39;m not I know a lot of folks for some</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.740" end="00:39:51.900" style="s2">folks in the developed world we have now</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.530" end="00:39:53.790" style="s2">me overflow which means that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.900" end="00:39:55.950" style="s2">have enough like for me right now I&#39;m in</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.510" end="00:40:19.110" style="s2">the idea here and you can think of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.550" end="00:40:20.520" style="s2">from a couple different perspectives one</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.110" end="00:40:22.890" style="s2">there&#39;s this beautiful graph over the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.520" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">last two centuries this top left one</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.890" end="00:40:26.910" style="s2">especially look at that one it&#39;s extreme</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:28.260" style="s2">poverty you know 200 years ago almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.910" end="00:40:30.360" style="s2">everybody was in extreme poverty you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.260" end="00:40:32.430" style="s2">know 94 percent of people and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.360" end="00:40:34.440" style="s2">less than 10% again that&#39;s still 750</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.430" end="00:40:35.970" style="s2">million people which is crazy but so</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.440" end="00:40:37.140" style="s2">much better than it used to be so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.970" end="00:40:38.940" style="s2">getting closer and close to that or like</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.140" end="00:40:40.110" style="s2">child mortality you should be half a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.940" end="00:40:41.670" style="s2">kid&#39;s you should die before the age of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.110" end="00:40:43.650" style="s2">five now it&#39;s less than five percent</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.670" end="00:40:45.030" style="s2">again like that&#39;s an amazing amazing</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.650" end="00:40:46.770" style="s2">thing so we can kind of see it from this</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.030" end="00:40:48.740" style="s2">macro perspective but also from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.770" end="00:40:50.900" style="s2">micro perspective so this is a graph of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.740" end="00:40:53.490" style="s2">individual income on the log scale</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.900" end="00:40:54.780" style="s2">versus how happy you get and of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.490" end="00:40:56.910" style="s2">at the very beginning like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.780" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">almost you who live on less than $2 a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.910" end="00:41:01.350" style="s2">day but the first thousand dollars you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:03.660" style="s2">get is super super super impactful it</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.350" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">makes you a lot happier but then as you</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.660" end="00:41:06.840" style="s2">keep on doing these dumplings it gets</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.760" style="s2">you up a bit but then once you get to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.840" end="00:41:10.110" style="s2">forty five thousand dollars per year it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.760" end="00:41:12.510" style="s2">essentially doesn&#39;t make you happier you</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.110" end="00:41:14.460" style="s2">essentially level out at that point and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.510" end="00:41:16.050" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very powerful perspective as</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.460" end="00:41:19.050" style="s2">why is someone like me why I just self</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.050" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">tax myself ten percent because I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.050" end="00:41:21.540" style="s2">look I got enough it doesn&#39;t the money&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:22.680" style="s2">not making you happier it actually makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.540" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">me happier to give it back to other</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.680" end="00:41:27.570" style="s2">people which is great praise II and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:28.410" style="s2">another key example this from a macro</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.570" end="00:41:30.360" style="s2">perspective just something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.410" end="00:41:31.920" style="s2">universal basic income if you think 200</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.360" end="00:41:34.140" style="s2">years ago would have been possible to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.920" end="00:41:35.460" style="s2">give everybody basic income when kids</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.140" end="00:41:38.280" style="s2">were still done when half kids are still</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.460" end="00:41:39.480" style="s2">but dying before the age of five no much</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.280" end="00:41:41.400" style="s2">more difficult but now it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.480" end="00:41:43.290" style="s2">possibility because we were having this</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.400" end="00:41:45.990" style="s2">abundance of capital where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.290" end="00:41:47.850" style="s2">can give back to the system so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.990" end="00:41:49.890" style="s2">show it so that&#39;s the idea behind it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.850" end="00:41:52.230" style="s2">it shows up in three big ways with our</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.890" end="00:41:54.210" style="s2">response one is these hashtags to us</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.230" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">like these mutual aid funds and three is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.210" end="00:41:58.890" style="s2">these billionaire philanthropy things so</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:42:01.320" style="s2">these hashtags the idea here is just to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.890" end="00:42:02.910" style="s2">let the money flow through you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.320" end="00:42:04.230" style="s2">this one hashtag past the check from</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.910" end="00:42:06.300" style="s2">give directly and this other one split</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.230" end="00:42:07.470" style="s2">the check again there&#39;s a hashtag I</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.300" end="00:42:10.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know where the hashtag is in here</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.470" end="00:42:11.070" style="s2">and thus far the idea is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.140" end="00:42:12.500" style="s2">get your check from the government you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.070" end="00:42:14.450" style="s2">$1,200 you just</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.500" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">give it to someone else you pledge to to</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.450" end="00:42:18.020" style="s2">let it pass through you and pass it on</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:19.370" style="s2">to someone else and roughly right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.020" end="00:42:21.290" style="s2">forgive directly about a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.370" end="00:42:22.700" style="s2">have pledged to pass on the check for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.290" end="00:42:24.370" style="s2">total of a million dollars that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.700" end="00:42:27.380" style="s2">very much in the big scheme of things</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.370" end="00:42:28.820" style="s2">but again similar to the things were</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.380" end="00:42:31.700" style="s2">chatting about earlier with the masks</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.820" end="00:42:33.590" style="s2">and 3m stuff um we didn&#39;t even see this</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.700" end="00:42:36.290" style="s2">very much during 2008 and 2008 financial</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.590" end="00:42:38.270" style="s2">crisis I mean hashtags hadn&#39;t were just</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.290" end="00:42:40.100" style="s2">invented 2007 at that time so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.270" end="00:42:42.590" style="s2">again these are proto examples of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.100" end="00:42:44.060" style="s2">the government you know doing helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.590" end="00:42:45.350" style="s2">money you know feeding us with money and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.060" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">then people reckon I think I can just</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.350" end="00:42:48.770" style="s2">let it flow through me back to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">system that&#39;s one example</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.770" end="00:42:53.960" style="s2">another is adding money to these shared</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:55.340" style="s2">pools so the idea here is that you just</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.960" end="00:42:56.390" style="s2">kind of have if you have bonus money you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.340" end="00:42:58.460" style="s2">can just kind of put it in the shared</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.390" end="00:43:00.140" style="s2">pool and let people take from it so</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.460" end="00:43:01.970" style="s2">these are all there&#39;s this huge</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.140" end="00:43:04.450" style="s2">explosion of mutual aid documents that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.970" end="00:43:06.740" style="s2">showed up after as kovat started and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.450" end="00:43:09.350" style="s2">these are just some notes of people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.740" end="00:43:12.230" style="s2">say hey um I convened oh four different</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.350" end="00:43:13.430" style="s2">parties $50 each for supplies PM me you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.230" end="00:43:15.260" style="s2">know or I hate this someone says hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.430" end="00:43:16.850" style="s2">convened owe you 40 bucks this is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.260" end="00:43:18.530" style="s2">first essay I convened in my you 50</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.850" end="00:43:19.820" style="s2">bucks to get groceries these are just a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.530" end="00:43:20.900" style="s2">button this and these are obviously just</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.820" end="00:43:22.190" style="s2">for exams there&#39;s so many people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.900" end="00:43:23.660" style="s2">speaking like look I got bonus money who</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.190" end="00:43:25.490" style="s2">needs it and so just putting into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.660" end="00:43:26.870" style="s2">shared pool and then trust and allowing</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.490" end="00:43:29.570" style="s2">anybody else to take that money from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.870" end="00:43:32.200" style="s2">pool this is obviously also happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.570" end="00:43:34.280" style="s2">with things like GoFundMe just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.200" end="00:43:35.750" style="s2">institutionalized or codified version of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.280" end="00:43:37.640" style="s2">this where you have these big pools of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.750" end="00:43:39.650" style="s2">people you know raising for America&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.640" end="00:43:41.450" style="s2">food fund this is you know 14 million</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.650" end="00:43:43.610" style="s2">bucks across you know 10,000 plus donors</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.450" end="00:43:45.350" style="s2">or this like frontline responders fund</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.610" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">which is you know 7 million bucks across</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.350" end="00:43:48.230" style="s2">almost 20 thousand donors so people</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:49.990" style="s2">being like look I got enough I can help</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.230" end="00:43:52.010" style="s2">out and I can give back to the system</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.990" end="00:43:53.060" style="s2">why don&#39;t make one final note on this</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.010" end="00:43:55.340" style="s2">which is kind of a weird one which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.060" end="00:43:57.230" style="s2">that I&#39;m all into the self taxing thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.340" end="00:43:59.030" style="s2">and giving back in a weird Friday race</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.230" end="00:44:01.220" style="s2">and so I was on Craigslist</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.030" end="00:44:03.380" style="s2">a year or two ago I just put up on there</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.220" end="00:44:06.470" style="s2">I said hey I have 300 20 bucks cash</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.380" end="00:44:07.640" style="s2">anybody want this and when I did that at</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.470" end="00:44:08.810" style="s2">the time and I was like talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.640" end="00:44:10.190" style="s2">with friends and went from the internet</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.810" end="00:44:11.750" style="s2">like people thought it was just weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.190" end="00:44:13.340" style="s2">they thought it was like really weird um</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.750" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">and it obviously is kind of weird but</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.340" end="00:44:17.600" style="s2">also now that this coke thing has</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">happened all these things are the exact</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.600" end="00:44:20.810" style="s2">same example this it&#39;s people just</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:22.790" style="s2">offering opting look I have this money</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.810" end="00:44:23.900" style="s2">does anybody want it and so now it just</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.790" end="00:44:24.860" style="s2">seems a little bit more normalized</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.900" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">they&#39;re just kind of cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.860" end="00:44:28.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the second big piece is adding</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:29.510" style="s2">money to shared pools and the third big</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.310" end="00:44:31.580" style="s2">piece is billionaire from the entropy</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.510" end="00:44:33.650" style="s2">this one this gets into the weirdness of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.580" end="00:44:35.900" style="s2">like abundance versus generosity like</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.650" end="00:44:38.930" style="s2">how generous am I personally really be</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.900" end="00:44:40.760" style="s2">eating if I live if I&#39;m a rich white man</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.930" end="00:44:42.500" style="s2">straight man who lives in America who</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.760" end="00:44:44.210" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a college house computer</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.500" end="00:44:45.470" style="s2">science degree and clearly have</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.210" end="00:44:47.030" style="s2">abundance like am I really being</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.470" end="00:44:48.410" style="s2">generous or is it just like me giving</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.030" end="00:44:51.080" style="s2">what I already but I didn&#39;t really earn</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.410" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">or whatever back the system any case you</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.080" end="00:44:53.810" style="s2">can see some examples this I think the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:55.580" style="s2">best one is someone like Jack Dorsey</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.810" end="00:44:57.980" style="s2">really giving I mean 20 percent of his</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.580" end="00:44:59.990" style="s2">wealth is a lot of his wealth I&#39;m into</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.980" end="00:45:02.390" style="s2">this fund and he just puts it in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.990" end="00:45:04.220" style="s2">also funny again back to the like bottom</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:05.630" style="s2">up this he just has a Google spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.220" end="00:45:08.120" style="s2">where he says here&#39;s how much money I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.630" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">giving two different things so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.120" end="00:45:12.620" style="s2">the final piece of this abundance thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:13.820" style="s2">so that&#39;s it here we&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.620" end="00:45:15.800" style="s2">going to go into these breakout rooms</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.820" end="00:45:20.120" style="s2">but I just want to go into conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.800" end="00:45:21.260" style="s2">mode to say again so the what was what</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.120" end="00:45:22.820" style="s2">we&#39;re mostly talking about here is this</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.260" end="00:45:24.350" style="s2">paradigm change which we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.820" end="00:45:27.110" style="s2">like tweaking some little parameters</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.350" end="00:45:28.430" style="s2">we&#39;re not even changing goals we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.110" end="00:45:30.860" style="s2">changing that we&#39;re trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.430" end="00:45:33.470" style="s2">these macro ideas of how institutions</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.860" end="00:45:34.670" style="s2">are formed and what money means and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.470" end="00:45:36.860" style="s2">other people have enough and whether you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.670" end="00:45:37.880" style="s2">need to you know you know hoard it all</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.860" end="00:45:39.350" style="s2">for yourself or that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.880" end="00:45:41.930" style="s2">change stuff at the paradigm level well</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.350" end="00:45:43.190" style="s2">then trickle down into laws and markets</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.930" end="00:45:45.710" style="s2">and code and all those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.190" end="00:45:47.090" style="s2">and here are these four big key ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.710" end="00:45:49.220" style="s2">that do it and I want to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.090" end="00:45:50.570" style="s2">one found out here which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.220" end="00:45:52.190" style="s2">Peter and I were chatting about this but</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.570" end="00:45:53.960" style="s2">when I was when we were discussing what</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.190" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">I should talk about it was like four IDs</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.960" end="00:45:57.500" style="s2">is kind of too many like it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:59.150" style="s2">ideas but they actually are interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.500" end="00:46:02.360" style="s2">and an interesting way and that like</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.150" end="00:46:03.560" style="s2">network ism is this move towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.360" end="00:46:05.120" style="s2">decentralized networks coherent</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.560" end="00:46:06.740" style="s2">pluralism is like the response to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.120" end="00:46:08.090" style="s2">like you have to be coherently plural</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.740" end="00:46:09.740" style="s2">given a decent choice since making</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.090" end="00:46:12.140" style="s2">environment or something like bento ism</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.740" end="00:46:13.550" style="s2">is an example of coherent pluralism its</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.140" end="00:46:15.260" style="s2">pluralistic and that&#39;s like it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.550" end="00:46:17.240" style="s2">two by two but it&#39;s also very coherent</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.260" end="00:46:19.400" style="s2">and clear what it is and of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.240" end="00:46:22.190" style="s2">generosity is can be expressed as</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.400" end="00:46:23.420" style="s2">now--my overflow claim so they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.190" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">of an express in each others and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.420" end="00:46:26.840" style="s2">obviously with generosity we saw lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">different like networks generosity where</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.840" end="00:46:29.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not like people are you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:31.220" style="s2">fact that people could just put on a</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.870" end="00:46:33.230" style="s2">random Google Doc spreadsheet hey</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.220" end="00:46:34.700" style="s2">anybody can have this venmo money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.230" end="00:46:36.710" style="s2">an example of this network spot</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.700" end="00:46:39.349" style="s2">about generosity - all these are being</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.710" end="00:46:40.250" style="s2">kind of embodied in both existing</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.349" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">institutions but also these new</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.250" end="00:46:45.410" style="s2">bottom-up networked institutions so</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:48.589" style="s2">that&#39;s the macro idea here and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.410" end="00:46:52.130" style="s2">what I would say is so a let me actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.589" end="00:46:54.950" style="s2">share someone asked for this let me put</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.130" end="00:46:57.079" style="s2">it in the chat I&#39;ll share this um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.950" end="00:47:00.230" style="s2">remind me later I don&#39;t care about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.079" end="00:47:04.810" style="s2">um this is the let me share this now I</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.230" end="00:47:07.790" style="s2">actually put in chat this is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.810" end="00:47:10.099" style="s2">spreadsheet or this is the Google Doc</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.329" end="00:47:55.940" style="s2">manifest within Kovan and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.430" end="00:47:57.770" style="s2">kind of find a path going for us to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.940" end="00:47:59.690" style="s2">sure that we decide you look something</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.770" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">kind of like this new paradigm instead</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.690" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">of something that&#39;s rejecting that um so</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:08.630" style="s2">with that thank you all again for coming</p>

<p begin="00:48:42.740" end="00:48:46.369" style="s2">was how impressed I was at the way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:48.170" style="s2">you were making sense of things and also</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.369" end="00:48:50.690" style="s2">the kind of rapidity of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.170" end="00:48:52.630" style="s2">your sense making response and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.690" end="00:48:55.130" style="s2">writing my own paper on how this can be</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.630" end="00:48:56.750" style="s2">like this moment can be an inflection</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.130" end="00:48:59.240" style="s2">point for handling at essential risk</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.750" end="00:49:03.740" style="s2">issues but I was wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.240" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">speak to how you are engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.740" end="00:49:07.730" style="s2">making sense of things but kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:09.859" style="s2">your own stack is there and then also</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.730" end="00:49:11.720" style="s2">how that might relate to collective</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.859" end="00:49:13.460" style="s2">intelligence how you&#39;re organizing when</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.720" end="00:49:15.170" style="s2">feeding off other people&#39;s ideas and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.460" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">you kind of maintain those connections</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.170" end="00:49:19.430" style="s2">yeah good question so and thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:20.869" style="s2">and it&#39;s also funny because they had the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.430" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">rapidity or the like the circular nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.869" end="00:49:24.049" style="s2">of it is kind of annoying but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:26.809" style="s2">true and I think it&#39;s crucial part of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.049" end="00:49:30.680" style="s2">so I think that the wait and let me say</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.809" end="00:49:31.970" style="s2">one thing also I guess if you notice</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.680" end="00:49:33.799" style="s2">essential risks I just want to put a</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.970" end="00:49:35.390" style="s2">quick plug for if you go to my website</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.799" end="00:49:37.099" style="s2">and go to my about me there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.390" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">hundred page book on Mehta existential</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.099" end="00:49:40.520" style="s2">risks so if you want to look at that if</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:42.859" style="s2">you&#39;re into how exponential curves are</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.520" end="00:49:45.170" style="s2">happening within AI nuclear security</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.859" end="00:49:47.150" style="s2">biosecurity and climate change and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.170" end="00:49:48.500" style="s2">to like meta solve them that&#39;s IDIA but</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.150" end="00:49:51.260" style="s2">hopefully the meta solve is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.500" end="00:49:54.530" style="s2">talking about today on your note of how</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.260" end="00:49:56.869" style="s2">I do my own sense making hmm so I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.530" end="00:49:58.970" style="s2">that it&#39;s weird I mean so for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.869" end="00:50:01.430" style="s2">personally there&#39;s these crucial</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.970" end="00:50:02.809" style="s2">networks of Facebook and Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:04.369" style="s2">those are things where you have to just</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.809" end="00:50:06.349" style="s2">it&#39;s really a coherent leap or</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.369" end="00:50:08.030" style="s2">perspective you&#39;re like okay who exists</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.349" end="00:50:09.559" style="s2">you know keeping your Twitter feed and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.030" end="00:50:10.579" style="s2">really think about who you&#39;re following</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.559" end="00:50:12.950" style="s2">and making sure you&#39;re following people</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.579" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">who you think are providing interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.950" end="00:50:16.130" style="s2">good information but also noticing your</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">own beacon so it takes a lot of self</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.130" end="00:50:20.780" style="s2">understanding here various folks on this</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:22.339" style="s2">call may be lawyers or developers or</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.780" end="00:50:24.589" style="s2">whatever and so it&#39;s like knowing who</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.339" end="00:50:25.910" style="s2">you are and then knowing that searching</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.589" end="00:50:27.829" style="s2">for other similar people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.910" end="00:50:29.030" style="s2">that and then putting out your beacon</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.829" end="00:50:30.470" style="s2">out there I mean I look I&#39;m a person</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.030" end="00:50:31.819" style="s2">who&#39;s like this and then when you say</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.470" end="00:50:34.430" style="s2">that&#39;s another people like oh me too</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.819" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">cool and then you start to just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.430" end="00:50:39.109" style="s2">combine around like like a snowball kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.280" style="s2">of so that&#39;s one thing I&#39;d say is within</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.109" end="00:50:43.339" style="s2">Twitter and Facebook make sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.280" end="00:50:45.589" style="s2">following in the right people and trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.339" end="00:50:48.440" style="s2">to know yourself and engage with those</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.589" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">people who are similar issue you then I</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.440" end="00:50:53.180" style="s2">would say that there&#39;s a also the sub</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:54.500" style="s2">stack at various newsletters so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.180" end="00:50:57.410" style="s2">a bunch of random newsletters that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.500" end="00:50:58.849" style="s2">follow and I could put it on my website</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.410" end="00:51:00.260" style="s2">sometime later but they&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.849" end="00:51:02.300" style="s2">crucial</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.260" end="00:51:03.950" style="s2">just like they&#39;re a bunch of random</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.300" end="00:51:07.820" style="s2">different newsletters about shareholder</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.820" end="00:51:11.240" style="s2">stuff so I not a clear answer there but</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.470" end="00:51:12.950" style="s2">um newsletters is the other crucial</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.240" end="00:51:13.970" style="s2">piece and then the collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.950" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">intelligence piece actually weird</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.970" end="00:51:17.780" style="s2">because I think there&#39;s um how one</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.060" style="s2">connects with others in this ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.780" end="00:51:22.070" style="s2">if I was operating in an old-school</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.170" end="00:51:36.350" style="s2">should I try to make money so those are</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.910" end="00:51:38.750" style="s2">like weirder questions I think are</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.350" end="00:51:40.580" style="s2">harder to answer but when I do that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.750" end="00:51:42.020" style="s2">try to just be in alignment with that</p>

<p begin="00:52:04.430" end="00:52:20.900" style="s2">to guess okay just so the question I had</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.020" end="00:52:22.460" style="s2">was something around uh what okay if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.900" end="00:52:25.670" style="s2">imagine it&#39;s two or three years from now</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.460" end="00:52:27.430" style="s2">and Kovac crisis has been and gone and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.670" end="00:52:31.430" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of back to like shitty normal</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.430" end="00:52:32.990" style="s2">what why would that like what would have</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.430" end="00:52:34.670" style="s2">been the cause of that like if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.990" end="00:52:35.990" style="s2">manage to put in any sort of like been</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.670" end="00:52:38.030" style="s2">to his principles that would no paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.990" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">shift that happened we went back to kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.030" end="00:52:42.920" style="s2">of this really uncomfortable capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">that everybody hates like what why would</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.920" end="00:52:47.180" style="s2">that have happened like what&#39;s yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.650" end="00:52:49.910" style="s2">that&#39;s good question I think that well I</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.180" end="00:52:51.470" style="s2">think that&#39;s most likely to happen like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.910" end="00:52:52.520" style="s2">that&#39;s all these things are just Pro to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.470" end="00:52:53.960" style="s2">examples we&#39;re just in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.520" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">stage here we&#39;re starting to make these</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.960" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">balls of people who are into these</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:58.280" style="s2">things and again there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:00.080" style="s2">there&#39;s eight billion people on earth</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.280" end="00:53:01.790" style="s2">and and we&#39;re even if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.080" end="00:53:03.800" style="s2">all those people and you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.790" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">still so 750 million I&#39;m sort of making</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.800" end="00:53:06.530" style="s2">less than two dollars a day it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:08.210" style="s2">they need to focus on their current</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.530" end="00:53:10.280" style="s2">scarcity stuff and it&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.210" end="00:53:12.920" style="s2">intense and sad and I think so yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.280" end="00:53:13.640" style="s2">is gonna be we talk about this a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.920" end="00:53:16.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.640" end="00:53:19.010" style="s2">not a 10-year startup plan it is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.039" end="00:53:20.269" style="s2">generational shift so in the next three</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.010" end="00:53:22.460" style="s2">years I pretty much expect things to go</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.269" end="00:53:25.059" style="s2">as as normal to go back but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.460" end="00:53:26.180" style="s2">what will happen in a negative sense is</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.059" end="00:53:29.720" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.180" end="00:53:32.390" style="s2">I think that some of the things are like</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.720" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">what will have gone wrong I think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.390" end="00:53:35.420" style="s2">many of the things that will have gone</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:36.260" style="s2">wrong there are starting to see are just</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.420" end="00:53:38.809" style="s2">like the classic</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.260" end="00:53:40.519" style="s2">tough things are those like nation seats</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.809" end="00:53:42.170" style="s2">are doing things that may not be the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.519" end="00:53:47.720" style="s2">best like you know the government has</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.170" end="00:53:48.799" style="s2">their 454 billion dollars of money that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.720" end="00:53:51.049" style="s2">they put in the Federal Reserve this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.799" end="00:53:52.670" style="s2">gonna lend that they can limit at ten to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.049" end="00:53:53.750" style="s2">one rate but they&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.670" end="00:53:55.160" style="s2">transparent about it right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.750" end="00:53:56.359" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like are we just gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.160" end="00:53:57.859" style="s2">some kind of thing or just like giving</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.359" end="00:53:59.089" style="s2">money backs like random rich people who</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.859" end="00:54:01.700" style="s2">have the amount of my to do lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.089" end="00:54:04.069" style="s2">like that could be sad and true so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.700" end="00:54:06.920" style="s2">think that that very well is it may</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.069" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">happen I thought maybe one way of asking</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.920" end="00:54:10.779" style="s2">this is like what are the opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:13.250" style="s2">that exists like roughly in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.779" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">good like what are the folks in the road</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.250" end="00:54:21.529" style="s2">that we have right now that like without</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:25.279" style="s2">taking them yeah yeah I think the forks</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.529" end="00:54:25.819" style="s2">that we have now are hmm I think a big</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.279" end="00:54:28.190" style="s2">Fork</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.819" end="00:54:30.710" style="s2">is something like what does the now that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.190" end="00:54:31.970" style="s2">we&#39;ve created you know Ray Dalio the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.710" end="00:54:33.049" style="s2">bridge water guy British water</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.970" end="00:54:35.269" style="s2">billionaires talk about okay we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.049" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">made a bunch of money how are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.269" end="00:54:39.559" style="s2">repay that debt and I think that the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:43.369" style="s2">that we think about who repays that debt</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.559" end="00:54:44.750" style="s2">and how and making sure that as we start</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.369" end="00:54:46.190" style="s2">to replay that and we make things and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.750" end="00:54:47.660" style="s2">again I&#39;m not like fully bullish on</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.190" end="00:54:49.339" style="s2">green New Deal stuff but making more</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.660" end="00:54:50.779" style="s2">green New Deal adjacent you know like</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.339" end="00:54:52.130" style="s2">that that we&#39;re you know moving things</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.779" end="00:54:54.920" style="s2">more towards this climate change you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.130" end="00:54:55.849" style="s2">future us inequality or equality based</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.920" end="00:54:59.029" style="s2">perspective I think would be really</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.849" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">powerful so one fork is how much does</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.029" end="00:55:01.640" style="s2">and again this is something that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:03.259" style="s2">for all of us individually here on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.640" end="00:55:06.140" style="s2">call to change but it&#39;s like from a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.259" end="00:55:08.089" style="s2">nation-state perspective how do those</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.140" end="00:55:09.859" style="s2">laws get implemented I think the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.089" end="00:55:12.140" style="s2">Forks just for us to know individually</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.859" end="00:55:14.569" style="s2">or like maybe the forks are just things</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.140" end="00:55:16.819" style="s2">like being with each other in groups um</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.569" end="00:55:19.339" style="s2">and these new weird sense making groups</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.819" end="00:55:20.900" style="s2">and just and I think that maybe Peters</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.339" end="00:55:22.039" style="s2">this is a perfect example this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.900" end="00:55:23.720" style="s2">something like the Stowe up or it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.039" end="00:55:25.009" style="s2">Peter had a fork in the road for himself</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.720" end="00:55:26.710" style="s2">he knew that he could be like a glue</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.009" end="00:55:28.090" style="s2">sense maker type and</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.710" end="00:55:30.340" style="s2">Stewart a space like this and he decided</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.090" end="00:55:31.480" style="s2">to do it and it&#39;s not like these 20</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.340" end="00:55:32.710" style="s2">people on the call over and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.480" end="00:55:34.360" style="s2">like change the world or ever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.710" end="00:55:37.690" style="s2">still just part of this massive movement</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.360" end="00:55:40.120" style="s2">but I think that there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.690" end="00:55:42.670" style="s2">which making seeing this time as an</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.120" end="00:55:44.770" style="s2">opportunity to connect with an</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.670" end="00:55:46.600" style="s2">experiment with these new forms of being</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.770" end="00:55:47.950" style="s2">with the other aligned people I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.600" end="00:55:49.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the primary fork in the road that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.950" end="00:55:51.010" style="s2">I see for us now for us to be like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.540" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">I am and you hop on that weird call with</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.010" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">those weird people are oh I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:56.470" style="s2">things in this weird new way that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">think what I would probably say so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.470" end="00:56:00.370" style="s2">do one final question Peter if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:03.400" style="s2">okay and then we&#39;ll okay and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.370" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">leave so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s better doing this</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.400" end="00:56:07.770" style="s2">but Colin do you have a question so go</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:11.980" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.770" end="00:56:13.840" style="s2">yeah no just some thoughts out of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.980" end="00:56:18.190" style="s2">you&#39;re just saying that sparked up for</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.840" end="00:56:21.160" style="s2">me is one you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.190" end="00:56:24.760" style="s2">possible troubles over the next few</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.160" end="00:56:26.530" style="s2">years coming out of this and I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.760" end="00:56:28.720" style="s2">of my big feels that I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.530" end="00:56:33.460" style="s2">about is kind of the shifts in my</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.720" end="00:56:36.550" style="s2">politics and James out of there&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.460" end="00:56:39.700" style="s2">the way that like security changed after</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.550" end="00:56:43.840" style="s2">9/11 how are we going to think of health</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.700" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">and wellness and also flus of people</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.840" end="00:56:49.300" style="s2">goods it said about how all institutions</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:52.390" style="s2">going to control how we live differently</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.300" end="00:56:55.140" style="s2">now because of us so that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.390" end="00:56:58.690" style="s2">question for me and then out of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.140" end="00:57:03.730" style="s2">what you were just saying about new ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.690" end="00:57:06.820" style="s2">of connecting etc thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.730" end="00:57:13.660" style="s2">decentering of normal and how what ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.820" end="00:57:15.850" style="s2">can we you told these features that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.660" end="00:57:18.990" style="s2">want and also how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.850" end="00:57:21.580" style="s2">questioning what do we want collectively</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.990" end="00:57:23.380" style="s2">you see that last piece of it more time</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.580" end="00:57:26.590" style="s2">Adi centering of normal and your in your</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.380" end="00:57:27.880" style="s2">your think about how do we come se more</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.590" end="00:57:32.110" style="s2">on that piece and how do we come to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.880" end="00:57:34.810" style="s2">conclusion of what we want maybe not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.110" end="00:57:37.660" style="s2">single conclusion but thinking about for</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.810" end="00:57:38.650" style="s2">already rather than in the information</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.660" end="00:57:45.510" style="s2">sense but in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.650" end="00:57:49.900" style="s2">political sense how do we find new goals</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.510" end="00:57:52.180" style="s2">thinking about these paradigms as will</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.900" end="00:57:54.850" style="s2">move towards that instead of we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.180" end="00:57:57.700" style="s2">back to normal how are we thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.850" end="00:58:01.900" style="s2">how do we build new goals that take new</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.700" end="00:58:05.050" style="s2">networks etc so just to be more thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.900" end="00:58:06.870" style="s2">on baddest interesting and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.050" end="00:58:10.270" style="s2">infrastructures that loops back into</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.870" end="00:58:15.220" style="s2">yeah so Nancy did you want to respond</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.270" end="00:58:18.040" style="s2">yet a quick response that we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.220" end="00:58:21.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve been given the opportunity to see</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.040" end="00:58:24.760" style="s2">more clearly the needs and the different</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.250" end="00:58:26.590" style="s2">ways of meeting the needs and in</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.760" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">addition to distilling from that</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.590" end="00:58:33.040" style="s2">abstractions and models and structures</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:36.150" style="s2">for sense making is to greatly enrich</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.040" end="00:58:38.560" style="s2">the stories the proofs of concept of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.150" end="00:58:41.010" style="s2">different ways of doing things that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.560" end="00:58:44.170" style="s2">emerging all over the world in response</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.010" end="00:58:47.050" style="s2">to the breakdowns and the opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.170" end="00:58:50.140" style="s2">and then reverse-engineer because part</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.050" end="00:58:52.870" style="s2">of how we discover what we really really</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.140" end="00:58:54.700" style="s2">want is to see something that we never</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.870" end="00:58:56.560" style="s2">thought of I think of what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.700" end="00:58:57.670" style="s2">Taiwan Taiwan&#39;s version of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.560" end="00:59:00.970" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.670" end="00:59:03.760" style="s2">like who knew just who knew but what do</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.970" end="00:59:05.890" style="s2">you see it&#39;s oh my god yeah that like</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:08.860" style="s2">makes sense and there&#39;s those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.890" end="00:59:11.410" style="s2">examples at all levels of society and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.860" end="00:59:13.810" style="s2">all sectors and branches of the needs</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.410" end="00:59:15.730" style="s2">these discoveries of how we actually can</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.810" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">meet our needs by healing and not</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.730" end="00:59:20.950" style="s2">harming the planet or the people and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:24.250" style="s2">then reflecting on sharing those stories</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.950" end="00:59:25.960" style="s2">not only raises our hope and our energy</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.250" end="00:59:27.700" style="s2">and our sense of possibility but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.960" end="00:59:30.550" style="s2">actually grounds it with a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.700" end="00:59:32.560" style="s2">direction because I didn&#39;t say how did</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.550" end="00:59:36.480" style="s2">they do it and then that starts</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.560" end="00:59:39.340" style="s2">illustrating or manifesting and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.480" end="00:59:41.700" style="s2">abstractions if we were using the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.340" end="00:59:44.320" style="s2">extract models as their sense making</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.700" end="00:59:47.800" style="s2">structures but then that populates that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.320" end="00:59:49.060" style="s2">in a living way yeah I agree and I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.800" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">that there&#39;s the way that I think about</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.060" end="00:59:52.180" style="s2">that is the usual way that things when</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:54.309" style="s2">you trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.180" end="00:59:56.619" style="s2">you can scale it like Instagram scale</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.309" end="00:59:58.930" style="s2">where they had 10 employees and still</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.619" end="01:00:01.030" style="s2">had 30 million users where they scaled</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.930" end="01:00:02.710" style="s2">through code through you know or you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.030" end="01:00:04.150" style="s2">scale things through like proto examples</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.710" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">where you&#39;re like hey look at how these</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.150" end="01:00:07.990" style="s2">people are doing this thing and then the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:09.700" style="s2">scale is just spreading that idea to</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.990" end="01:00:11.109" style="s2">other folks it&#39;s not like the original</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.700" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">people that got the idea are like making</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.109" end="01:00:13.990" style="s2">money from like everybody else doing it</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:15.460" style="s2">or it was just like this was a good</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.990" end="01:00:17.290" style="s2">thing looks like scale that around the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.460" end="01:00:18.730" style="s2">world and so I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.290" end="01:00:20.530" style="s2">good perspective that I agree with yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.730" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">I think I&#39;d say to your question colin</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.530" end="01:00:24.010" style="s2">is i think a lot of what you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:25.839" style="s2">get these new goals we talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.010" end="01:00:27.880" style="s2">a lot is like when you think about from</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.839" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">like a kuhnian structure of scientific</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.880" end="01:00:30.930" style="s2">revolutions perspective these new</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:33.190" style="s2">paradigms and we make a new paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.930" end="01:00:34.630" style="s2">there&#39;s like the new paradigm piece</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.190" end="01:00:36.880" style="s2">which is one kind of science like whoa</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.630" end="01:00:38.109" style="s2">there&#39;s a new relativity stuff or but</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.880" end="01:00:39.700" style="s2">then there&#39;s like the normal science</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.109" end="01:00:41.020" style="s2">within that new paradigm we&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.700" end="01:00:42.760" style="s2">how you just creating that increment</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.020" end="01:00:44.890" style="s2">stuff so I think that a lot of what we</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.760" end="01:00:46.300" style="s2">need to do now is like for folks like us</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.890" end="01:00:48.220" style="s2">who are like oh man like super</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.300" end="01:00:49.809" style="s2">pluralistic and meta modernist whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.220" end="01:00:51.069" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s cool but how do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.809" end="01:00:53.069" style="s2">actually do the normal science how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.069" end="01:00:56.230" style="s2">you just like make stuff actually happen</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.069" end="01:00:57.700" style="s2">and so I think that and I can get down</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.230" end="01:00:58.869" style="s2">to the metrics piece essentially and</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.700" end="01:01:01.210" style="s2">that kind of gets also to this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.869" end="01:01:02.799" style="s2">like if yeah so so that&#39;s one thing I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.210" end="01:01:04.839" style="s2">say the thing that I just agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.799" end="01:01:06.760" style="s2">on is I think that there&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.839" end="01:01:08.109" style="s2">supply chains and the weird like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.760" end="01:01:09.369" style="s2">fact that this is both a super</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.109" end="01:01:11.530" style="s2">connecting thing but also a very</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.369" end="01:01:13.420" style="s2">isolating thing and how this it shows</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.530" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">our like lack of resilience or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.420" end="01:01:16.150" style="s2">our just-in-time supply chain stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:17.319" style="s2">then obviously the security and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.150" end="01:01:19.059" style="s2">surveillance stuff I think that would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.319" end="01:01:19.960" style="s2">a those are some of the trade-offs that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.059" end="01:01:21.940" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with right now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.960" end="01:01:24.210" style="s2">okay the trade-off of Public Health is</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.940" end="01:01:26.349" style="s2">probably good enough for the for</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.210" end="01:01:28.569" style="s2">surveilling us to some extent and again</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.349" end="01:01:30.010" style="s2">depending the new Bluetooth Google Apple</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.569" end="01:01:32.109" style="s2">surveillance things are less surveilling</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.010" end="01:01:33.579" style="s2">it than normal but so so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.109" end="01:01:34.540" style="s2">that trade-off is definitely at hand and</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.579" end="01:01:36.730" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that as one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.540" end="01:01:38.740" style="s2">bifurcations for sure is like the you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.730" end="01:01:40.690" style="s2">know disaster capitalism versus or like</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.740" end="01:01:43.390" style="s2">taking advantage of the crisis for money</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.690" end="01:01:45.910" style="s2">or they&#39;re doing in Taiwan where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.390" end="01:01:51.339" style="s2">turned the trade-off between security</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.910" end="01:01:53.530" style="s2">and our safety into an integrated</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.339" end="01:01:55.180" style="s2">synergy where their democracy is</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.530" end="01:01:57.900" style="s2">actually being enhanced by how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.180" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">using AI instead of the other the ground</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.900" end="01:02:05.130" style="s2">yeah yeah I like recently and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:07.230" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
