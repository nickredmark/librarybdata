<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:06.710" style="s2">I&#39;m joined today by Heather and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:09.300" style="s2">another person if they if they show up</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.710" end="00:00:10.460" style="s2">this week&#39;s question is how are you</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:14.280" style="s2">feeling about the world right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.460" end="00:00:16.619" style="s2">looking forward to hearing the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.280" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">is going is a space and will eventually</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">be its own platform where everybody gets</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">to show up exactly as they are and have</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">a conversation with real people in real</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:28.019" style="s2">time to connect humanity in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:30.330" style="s2">our current social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.019" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t and i&#39;m also envision</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.330" end="00:00:34.590" style="s2">@vn a social media platform that we all</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">own together and operate together so</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.590" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">that as we all see ways to improve it so</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:42.989" style="s2">that it&#39;s a more enjoyable conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">or a more productive conversation we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.989" end="00:00:49.770" style="s2">we can add those features so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">get started so like I said this week&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.770" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">question is how are you feeling about</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">the world right now and as people share</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">people there&#39;s only two of us as we eat</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:01.230" style="s2">sure I&#39;ve been dropping down likewhen</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">tea session when I was five of us so</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.230" end="00:01:05.070" style="s2">that just the person&#39;s face is on camera</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:08.970" style="s2">to share and you know you kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.070" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">the spotlight for that time period yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.970" end="00:01:13.229" style="s2">that is what yeah we didn&#39;t do that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">first week and it works kind of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.229" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">pros and cons to both ways both ways of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">doing it so I&#39;ll suggest would you like</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">to start sharing Heather would you like</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">me to start why don&#39;t you start okay all</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:29.310" style="s2">right so I&#39;ll just drop you down and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">then I&#39;ll try to keep my eye on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">5-minute marker and then I&#39;ll sure all</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">right how I am feeling about the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:43.170" style="s2">right now is a very dichotomous very</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">divided I feel that the track we are on</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:51.470" style="s2">that humanity is living towards is chaos</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">and it makes me feel uneasy and sad and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.470" end="00:01:57.680" style="s2">very worried about our future and at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">same time this week especially there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.680" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">millions of people marching in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">street demanding our governments take</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">action on climate change and even if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">don&#39;t think that is the course of action</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:11.430" style="s2">that we is the most effective I still</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:14.010" style="s2">very much appreciate that there are so</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.430" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">many people out there who care who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.010" end="00:02:22.379" style="s2">showing up and and sharing that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">want a better world I have a lot of hope</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.379" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">for the future I got introduced to game</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:31.739" style="s2">B over the last couple weeks and with</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">game became an introduction to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.739" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">humans who also care about the world and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.680" end="00:02:40.440" style="s2">also want a new system rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:41.700" style="s2">one we&#39;re currently playing game a is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">what we&#39;re currently playing that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.700" end="00:02:48.209" style="s2">very leading us sports collapse but is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:51.000" style="s2">very its combative there&#39;s winners and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.209" end="00:02:54.680" style="s2">losers and so the idea is game B has to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.000" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">come out of game a and it also is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:02:59.849" style="s2">system that should be on the wind that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">should be everybody wins and what I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.849" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">envisioned over the last three years for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:06.690" style="s2">a global cooperative I think gets us</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">there so I&#39;ve had been sitting in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.690" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">weird feeling of I have hope for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:14.120" style="s2">future because I have a real idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:20.160" style="s2">can get us there and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.120" end="00:03:22.230" style="s2">feeling constantly like how can I be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.160" end="00:03:28.079" style="s2">one to get us there with my limitations</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.230" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">and my who I am and so I&#39;ve had to do a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.079" end="00:03:33.090" style="s2">lot of personal development a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:35.540" style="s2">meditation and and growth and learning</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.090" end="00:03:41.099" style="s2">through just making mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.540" end="00:03:42.359" style="s2">figuring it out and I have every belief</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.099" end="00:03:44.730" style="s2">that we can create a better world</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.359" end="00:03:47.549" style="s2">together just why I keep showing up who</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.730" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">I keep putting myself online the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.549" end="00:03:54.470" style="s2">Cafe is the newest iteration of that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">have so much I can see where this can go</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.470" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">having a space that all of humanity can</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">come to be part of a conversation when</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:03.959" style="s2">we are not divided like we currently are</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:06.540" style="s2">when you can&#39;t just have your side or</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.959" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">another side yelling at the other groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.540" end="00:04:10.709" style="s2">you know telling you what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">until I&#39;m not listening say listening to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.709" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">what people believe it actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">listening for understanding I this last</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">week have had visions of creating</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">citizens assembly which is what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">extinction rebellion wants to do they</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:25.730" style="s2">want our governments to do it so that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:27.500" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.730" end="00:04:29.480" style="s2">so that their governments listened to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.500" end="00:04:31.010" style="s2">the citizens assembly and isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.480" end="00:04:33.890" style="s2">bipartisan every four years of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.010" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">fluctuates back and forth and I see very</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.890" end="00:04:38.150" style="s2">much that our idea Cafe platform that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:40.580" style="s2">envision can be used to just pull the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.150" end="00:04:41.780" style="s2">citizens assembly now and can meet the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.580" end="00:04:44.930" style="s2">first two demands which are tell the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.780" end="00:04:49.130" style="s2">truth and take action that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.930" end="00:04:50.390" style="s2">that and so I am excited to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.130" end="00:04:52.730" style="s2">doing this every week this week was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.390" end="00:04:54.440" style="s2">little hard because there aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.730" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">same number of people that are working</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.440" end="00:04:58.850" style="s2">here last week but also I didn&#39;t put in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:00.200" style="s2">the same effort I did last week I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.850" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">reach out to people until Monday because</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.200" end="00:05:04.580" style="s2">I was busy doing game B stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">thinking about that so that that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.580" end="00:05:10.060" style="s2">learning this week is how to how to grow</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:13.310" style="s2">this and how to make this a space of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.060" end="00:05:15.650" style="s2">inclusion and enjoyment that people want</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.310" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">to come to and want to share in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.650" end="00:05:20.540" style="s2">moment and I know YouTube is a weird</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:22.820" style="s2">space to do it on because it&#39;s not zoom</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.540" end="00:05:25.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not private it&#39;s it&#39;s showing up</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.820" end="00:05:28.640" style="s2">and going live in front of the world my</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.370" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">15 subscribers but theoretically it</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.640" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">could be and so I want a platform that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">everybody feels the safe and comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:36.500" style="s2">on because I want everybody to be able</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:38.870" style="s2">to show up not just people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.500" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">comfortable being on camera on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.870" end="00:05:42.410" style="s2">so that is how I&#39;m feeling about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:45.320" style="s2">world right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.410" end="00:05:48.350" style="s2">and that is is definitely my my five</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.620" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">own experience which is what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.100" end="00:06:14.330" style="s2">do but rather than do that I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:18.940" style="s2">gonna come to the present moment and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.330" end="00:06:26.830" style="s2">address the question which is how do I</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.940" end="00:06:26.830" style="s2">feel about the world right now hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.920" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">my temptation is always to go to what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.390" end="00:06:37.779" style="s2">think about the world but what I feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:42.009" style="s2">about the world is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.779" end="00:06:43.899" style="s2">I think I&#39;m gonna use your word of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.009" end="00:06:50.999" style="s2">dichotomy but I feel sadness and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.899" end="00:07:01.329" style="s2">excitement I feel loss and potential I</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.999" end="00:07:04.179" style="s2">feel death and burst now the sad side</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.329" end="00:07:08.289" style="s2">the death side the sense of something</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.179" end="00:07:14.469" style="s2">coming to an end game a feels more</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.289" end="00:07:18.129" style="s2">certain to me and the potential side the</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.819" end="00:10:18.699" style="s2">much for sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:20.319" style="s2">I felt like yours was much more succinct</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.699" end="00:10:25.209" style="s2">to actually answer the question which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.319" end="00:10:27.939" style="s2">how you&#39;re feeling I exist in a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.209" end="00:10:30.490" style="s2">cognitive brain worlds which is where my</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.939" end="00:10:32.920" style="s2">ideas have come from but have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.490" end="00:10:35.079" style="s2">living more in a heart centered feeling</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.920" end="00:10:36.670" style="s2">the emotion doing learning from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.079" end="00:10:39.730" style="s2">emotions that come up learning from my</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.670" end="00:10:43.870" style="s2">triggers and there&#39;s so much power there</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.730" end="00:10:45.850" style="s2">and so much like that is how we change</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.870" end="00:10:49.449" style="s2">the world like you said the feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.850" end="00:10:51.550" style="s2">sadness is so important and I hope this</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.449" end="00:10:53.290" style="s2">becomes a space that&#39;s where I like I</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.550" end="00:10:55.449" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to be fake positivity by</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.290" end="00:10:58.750" style="s2">any stretch like I want it to be real</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.449" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">and the irony that it&#39;s live on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.750" end="00:11:03.790" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s a ho</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:07.990" style="s2">showing up and I&#39;m envisioning ways of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.790" end="00:11:11.490" style="s2">bringing it off YouTube on to zoom and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.990" end="00:11:15.280" style="s2">into a space where anyone can show up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.490" end="00:11:18.520" style="s2">discuss issues right be with each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.280" end="00:11:22.210" style="s2">in that sadness and passion and vision</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.520" end="00:11:26.410" style="s2">and confusion and the food is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.210" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">chaotic a chaotic time period and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.410" end="00:11:30.820" style="s2">many people don&#39;t have community don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:34.060" style="s2">have a space to do that in but they want</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.820" end="00:11:36.010" style="s2">to and if we can create that for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.060" end="00:11:37.510" style="s2">people who want to I think it&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.010" end="00:11:41.710" style="s2">safer for the people who aren&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.510" end="00:11:43.720" style="s2">ready yet and so that&#39;s a bit of what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.710" end="00:11:45.490" style="s2">got Thank You sherry that was that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.720" end="00:11:50.380" style="s2">idea we come back together feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.490" end="00:11:52.510" style="s2">all over the place today it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.380" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">just trying to think cuz I&#39;ve lost I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:55.570" style="s2">lost my throat a little bit but so oh I</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:58.150" style="s2">know what it was what&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.570" end="00:11:59.940" style="s2">you said that well if you think he said</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.150" end="00:12:02.790" style="s2">that really landed but one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.940" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">coming out of this sort of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.790" end="00:12:07.450" style="s2">dominance space intellect dominant space</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.560" end="00:12:13.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s very much where I come from</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.450" end="00:12:19.290" style="s2">also and I&#39;m on a a very new and strange</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.180" end="00:12:19.290" style="s2">journey into feeling and being and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.370" end="00:12:25.810" style="s2">femininity all these things that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.660" end="00:12:30.010" style="s2">that are you know not the sanctioned</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.810" end="00:12:33.580" style="s2">order of our society and I&#39;ve often feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.010" end="00:12:35.670" style="s2">hope because precisely because I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.580" end="00:12:39.820" style="s2">come from so far in the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.670" end="00:12:42.010" style="s2">that if I can make this shift like</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.820" end="00:12:44.770" style="s2">there&#39;s there were so many people that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.010" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">are in a much more moderate place than I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.770" end="00:12:50.770" style="s2">ever was in terms of the balance between</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">emotion and intellect but hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.770" end="00:12:58.270" style="s2">it should be easier for them to to come</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:13:02.010" style="s2">to a more heart centered place so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.270" end="00:13:06.730" style="s2">interesting you also came from that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.010" end="00:13:07.960" style="s2">direction yeah it&#39;s funny I keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.730" end="00:13:10.930" style="s2">because I think I&#39;ve been putting my</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.960" end="00:13:13.590" style="s2">idea out there for years now in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.930" end="00:13:15.450" style="s2">various formats and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.590" end="00:13:18.029" style="s2">wanting to explain it should like</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.450" end="00:13:21.270" style="s2">convince you of the way right it to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.029" end="00:13:23.130" style="s2">like but this is why and how and my</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.270" end="00:13:24.990" style="s2">brain has a DD and recently I figured</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.130" end="00:13:26.760" style="s2">out I also have autism and I also have</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.990" end="00:13:28.080" style="s2">had brain tumors I have some brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.760" end="00:13:30.630" style="s2">damage in between all of that and just</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.080" end="00:13:31.700" style="s2">my personality and the way the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.630" end="00:13:34.470" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.700" end="00:13:36.360" style="s2">the how and why it&#39;s never gonna bring</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.470" end="00:13:37.860" style="s2">people the why is but the how and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.360" end="00:13:39.150" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t bring people and even</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.860" end="00:13:42.779" style="s2">though I&#39;m like look at the spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.150" end="00:13:44.370" style="s2">in the graphs where is speaking from my</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.779" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">heart and like my heart doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.370" end="00:13:48.120" style="s2">DD like my heart and I love that my</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:50.010" style="s2">brain does it&#39;s how I&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.120" end="00:13:51.870" style="s2">think about it I don&#39;t want to discount</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.010" end="00:13:55.320" style="s2">my brain for that but I&#39;m like oh and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.870" end="00:13:56.820" style="s2">speak from the heart and feel it feel it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.320" end="00:13:58.920" style="s2">speaking for my heart and like in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.820" end="00:13:59.580" style="s2">throat it&#39;s much more emotion ends up</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.920" end="00:14:04.230" style="s2">coming up</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.580" end="00:14:05.970" style="s2">but people hear it better and resonate</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.230" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">with it more because they feel it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.970" end="00:14:09.540" style="s2">their body they feel that hope or</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:13.260" style="s2">sadness or whatever it is that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.540" end="00:14:15.330" style="s2">and but it&#39;s learning it&#39;s learning how</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.260" end="00:14:19.589" style="s2">to do that how to tap into that more</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.330" end="00:14:23.850" style="s2">especially when our world is very</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.589" end="00:14:25.320" style="s2">cognitive and also that is like a right</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.850" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">or wrong thing it&#39;s like you know me I</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.320" end="00:14:28.650" style="s2">can be proven wrong and like I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">the work you can&#39;t prove me wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.650" end="00:14:34.140" style="s2">like I can have the debate I can win it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:35.490" style="s2">I can it&#39;s like emotion isn&#39;t that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.140" end="00:14:37.620" style="s2">like you show up as you are and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.490" end="00:14:39.960" style="s2">no wrong to be you might do something</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.620" end="00:14:42.540" style="s2">wrong in that emotion but you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.960" end="00:14:46.380" style="s2">wrong for being angry or hopeful or sad</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.540" end="00:14:48.050" style="s2">or feeling confused and so confusion is</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.380" end="00:14:52.020" style="s2">one of the spaces I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.050" end="00:14:53.430" style="s2">confusion and shame are like to allow</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.020" end="00:14:55.950" style="s2">people to be like that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.430" end="00:14:57.720" style="s2">sense to me I&#39;m comfortable enough and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.950" end="00:14:59.010" style="s2">my intellect to always say that what</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.720" end="00:15:00.410" style="s2">what are you talking about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.010" end="00:15:02.610" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.410" end="00:15:04.860" style="s2">except in the hard space where I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.610" end="00:15:07.770" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what I feel I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.860" end="00:15:11.480" style="s2">what what is there and so yeah it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.770" end="00:15:11.480" style="s2">nice sitting with you and sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.750" end="00:15:19.470" style="s2">that that it&#39;s not discomfort with</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.940" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">ambiguity right that we I guess because</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.470" end="00:15:26.520" style="s2">the intellect doesn&#39;t want to allow for</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:27.060" style="s2">ambiguity and we&#39;re so intellectual in</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.520" end="00:15:32.270" style="s2">our culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.060" end="00:15:34.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost which is hilarious because</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.270" end="00:15:36.990" style="s2">everything in life pretty much is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.680" end="00:15:42.360" style="s2">ambiguous and everything is uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.990" end="00:15:44.490" style="s2">and to imagine that we&#39;re somehow can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.360" end="00:15:51.480" style="s2">certain and that things cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.490" end="00:15:54.150" style="s2">ambiguous is possibly the the least the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.480" end="00:15:58.380" style="s2">least close to reality that we could get</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.150" end="00:16:03.450" style="s2">and yet when we&#39;re in that space it</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.380" end="00:16:06.900" style="s2">feels completely true but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.450" end="00:16:11.010" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s yeah and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.900" end="00:16:12.990" style="s2">trip absolutely I mean my vision for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.010" end="00:16:15.960" style="s2">global tech cooperative is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:19.140" style="s2">cognitive stuff is a lot of like how we</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.960" end="00:16:21.990" style="s2">get on the same page on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.140" end="00:16:23.760" style="s2">science stuff in history and not that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.990" end="00:16:25.890" style="s2">has to be black and white there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.760" end="00:16:28.140" style="s2">of gray area and everything but like get</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.890" end="00:16:29.880" style="s2">that down like a look at that see where</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.140" end="00:16:32.610" style="s2">you know why we believe this and why we</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.880" end="00:16:34.020" style="s2">believe that but part of that in order</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.610" end="00:16:35.370" style="s2">to great create that in the world I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.020" end="00:16:36.780" style="s2">had to get more heart-centered and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.370" end="00:16:39.870" style="s2">getting more heart center to felt the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.780" end="00:16:41.910" style="s2">more power in there and like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.870" end="00:16:43.530" style="s2">almost like I want the cognitive piece</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.910" end="00:16:45.540" style="s2">or just the online where we can all look</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.530" end="00:16:48.120" style="s2">at it so we can all do the hard work so</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.540" end="00:16:50.280" style="s2">like that&#39;s kind of done we have that if</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.120" end="00:16:53.070" style="s2">you want to work on that you can but</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.280" end="00:16:54.810" style="s2">also we don&#39;t need to because this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.070" end="00:16:57.030" style="s2">where like the magic happens in</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.810" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">community and relationships and personal</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.030" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">growth is in the like emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:05.490" style="s2">heart-centered and we all have different</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:07.560" style="s2">things that interest us cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.490" end="00:17:10.890" style="s2">whereas we all kind of experience the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.560" end="00:17:13.470" style="s2">same emotions and you know having more</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.890" end="00:17:15.030" style="s2">tools to deal with our emotional</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.470" end="00:17:17.630" style="s2">intelligence and how to sit with one</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.030" end="00:17:21.450" style="s2">another in those uncomfortable emotions</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.630" end="00:17:22.830" style="s2">is what we need in order to ask people</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.450" end="00:17:24.810" style="s2">to join us in those uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.830" end="00:17:27.930" style="s2">emotions right is like well what do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.810" end="00:17:30.060" style="s2">do what do you like nothing is easier</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.930" end="00:17:33.990" style="s2">than sitting meditating and nothing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.060" end="00:17:36.330" style="s2">harder sitting with yourself in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.990" end="00:17:38.820" style="s2">space is both like it feels like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.330" end="00:17:40.200" style="s2">gonna die a little bit and also like</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.820" end="00:17:43.019" style="s2">it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.200" end="00:17:47.850" style="s2">Oshin and only thoughts that as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.019" end="00:17:50.909" style="s2">know can&#39;t kill you and just a trip</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.850" end="00:17:56.700" style="s2">every time that I you know re re get to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.909" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">that yeah true I wonder when when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.700" end="00:18:01.169" style="s2">talking about having the the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">stuff laid out and and then sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.169" end="00:18:09.059" style="s2">heart stuff do you think the is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:11.820" style="s2">cognitive stuff to you is that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.059" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">the what of the project and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.820" end="00:18:18.419" style="s2">heart is sort of the how or the why do</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:21.210" style="s2">you divide it that way at all because</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.419" end="00:18:22.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve sort of found that delineation</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.210" end="00:18:25.230" style="s2">happening for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.730" end="00:18:26.639" style="s2">where society generally is all about</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.230" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">what what are we gonna do about climate</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.639" end="00:18:29.990" style="s2">change what are we gonna do about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:34.260" style="s2">what are we gonna do about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.990" end="00:18:37.559" style="s2">important questions but the how the why</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.260" end="00:18:39.210" style="s2">those things are I think associated with</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.559" end="00:18:41.429" style="s2">the heart but I&#39;m just curious if that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.210" end="00:18:43.019" style="s2">lands for you at all a little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.429" end="00:18:44.669" style="s2">with at least for me putting the project</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.019" end="00:18:48.389" style="s2">out there that&#39;s like I said definitely</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.669" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">been the case but I also feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.389" end="00:18:54.149" style="s2">cognitive piece is to me truth-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:56.549" style="s2">it&#39;s like whether I want this to be true</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.149" end="00:18:58.980" style="s2">or not what is the actual truth what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.549" end="00:19:01.139" style="s2">the data and what is the like where can</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.980" end="00:19:04.760" style="s2">it go wrong and how like looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.139" end="00:19:08.070" style="s2">reality even if it&#39;s not comfortable and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.760" end="00:19:09.720" style="s2">then on top of that maybe making it work</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.070" end="00:19:11.970" style="s2">be like you know and we&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.720" end="00:19:14.539" style="s2">feel any way we do about that right that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.970" end="00:19:16.950" style="s2">like here is where carbons coming from</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.539" end="00:19:18.600" style="s2">so you can&#39;t spin it you can&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.950" end="00:19:20.370" style="s2">the are your cultural industry you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.600" end="00:19:22.470" style="s2">point to the airplanes and the airplanes</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.370" end="00:19:24.630" style="s2">point to a agricultural industry like</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.470" end="00:19:26.610" style="s2">having actual truths and like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.630" end="00:19:28.409" style="s2">know that and maybe we can never know</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.610" end="00:19:30.539" style="s2">that but what&#39;s our best guess and where</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.409" end="00:19:33.330" style="s2">does that come from so that we can then</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.539" end="00:19:35.940" style="s2">deal with like the emotions of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.330" end="00:19:38.370" style="s2">planet any how we actually like move</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:40.740" style="s2">forward as a planet and so yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.370" end="00:19:42.090" style="s2">find those what how and that&#39;s every</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.740" end="00:19:43.380" style="s2">time I sit down to explain something</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.090" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">those are literal I do all of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.380" end="00:19:47.100" style="s2">questions like what when where why even</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:50.340" style="s2">if they&#39;re not appropriate like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.100" end="00:19:53.490" style="s2">that&#39;s how it makes it easier and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.340" end="00:19:53.820" style="s2">why definitely brings out the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.490" end="00:19:56.669" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.820" end="00:19:58.710" style="s2">and the how is both cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.669" end="00:20:01.379" style="s2">emotional because it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.710" end="00:20:04.109" style="s2">we need the we need the truth and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.379" end="00:20:06.330" style="s2">need the the action the passion you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.109" end="00:20:08.999" style="s2">the the to meet people where they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.330" end="00:20:10.979" style="s2">that&#39;s a big piece is instead of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.999" end="00:20:13.139" style="s2">demanding you know because cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.979" end="00:20:15.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not vegan but I might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.139" end="00:20:17.399" style="s2">convince you to go vegan cognitively but</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.690" end="00:20:20.039" style="s2">it&#39;s never gonna convince you it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.399" end="00:20:21.779" style="s2">gonna get there whereas if like I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.039" end="00:20:23.909" style="s2">ask you hey do you think we should all</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.779" end="00:20:26.129" style="s2">eat more vegetarian if you do why aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.909" end="00:20:29.129" style="s2">you and how do we solve that together</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.129" end="00:20:33.269" style="s2">instead of like you&#39;re wrong for eating</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.129" end="00:20:34.889" style="s2">that way whatever way Pete and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.269" end="00:20:36.899" style="s2">meeting people where they&#39;re at because</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.889" end="00:20:37.799" style="s2">I don&#39;t have a solution to make people</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.899" end="00:20:40.950" style="s2">not be who they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.799" end="00:20:42.629" style="s2">I think the best growth happens when</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.950" end="00:20:44.190" style="s2">we&#39;re seen and accepted for who we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.629" end="00:20:46.499" style="s2">and then we can see where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.190" end="00:20:51.629" style="s2">problem be like oh I&#39;m gonna grow here</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.499" end="00:20:54.419" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna grow there that makes that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.629" end="00:20:59.970" style="s2">makes a lot of sense the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.419" end="00:21:02.369" style="s2">hit me was I was really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.970" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">I&#39;m actually getting curious about more</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.369" end="00:21:07.019" style="s2">about your background - like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:13.470" style="s2">in academia or what what your history is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.019" end="00:21:20.009" style="s2">but I&#39;m an artist and art is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.470" end="00:21:22.950" style="s2">seeking subjective truth but it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.009" end="00:21:26.399" style="s2">me it&#39;s not farther away from the truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.950" end="00:21:27.570" style="s2">it&#39;s just a different path to it and one</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.399" end="00:21:31.769" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ll point you to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.570" end="00:21:33.210" style="s2">so interesting is Van Gogh&#39;s Starry</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.769" end="00:21:35.399" style="s2">Night I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.210" end="00:21:38.729" style="s2">with the painting it&#39;s yeah the swirls</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.399" end="00:21:41.309" style="s2">and the sky and everything so apparently</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.729" end="00:21:43.859" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the best representations</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.309" end="00:21:46.619" style="s2">of turbulence which is notoriously hard</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.859" end="00:21:50.549" style="s2">to pin down visually what turbulent</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.619" end="00:21:53.549" style="s2">looks like and so they like and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.549" end="00:21:55.859" style="s2">sense like if I think about it to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.549" end="00:21:58.649" style="s2">able to tune in to what does turbulence</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.859" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">feel like and somehow paint it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.649" end="00:22:04.919" style="s2">very hard thing to do but it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:07.650" style="s2">because because that feeling heart</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.919" end="00:22:11.550" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.650" end="00:22:14.790" style="s2">have some kind of interface with with</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.550" end="00:22:18.980" style="s2">everything around us and so it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.790" end="00:22:23.060" style="s2">capable of true perception it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.980" end="00:22:24.180" style="s2">it&#39;s just filtered up to us differently</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.060" end="00:22:27.810" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.180" end="00:22:30.210" style="s2">yeah yeah I love that and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.810" end="00:22:32.760" style="s2">my background is in academia I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.210" end="00:22:36.840" style="s2">scientist by by trade and my other</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.760" end="00:22:39.630" style="s2">Bachelor of Science and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.840" end="00:22:41.730" style="s2">like I think people somewhat fall on one</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.630" end="00:22:43.770" style="s2">or the other but it&#39;s the inter woven</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.730" end="00:22:45.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like how you know I love that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.770" end="00:22:48.420" style="s2">don&#39;t know that a little story night and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.800" end="00:22:50.490" style="s2">having that be the like that&#39;s how and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.420" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">when you look at nature and it&#39;s fractal</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.490" end="00:22:55.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s like oh this is we try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:57.090" style="s2">understand something and we always fail</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.230" end="00:22:58.740" style="s2">as humans because we can&#39;t see the hole</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.090" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">we break the hole into parts that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.740" end="00:23:01.530" style="s2">understand the parts and we think we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">put them back together and understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.530" end="00:23:06.450" style="s2">the whole and we can&#39;t and I think art</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:08.450" style="s2">helps hugely with that I know for me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.450" end="00:23:11.880" style="s2">not I don&#39;t consider myself an artist</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.450" end="00:23:15.180" style="s2">but where my best ideas have come from</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.880" end="00:23:17.250" style="s2">was when I wasn&#39;t able to reap it in new</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.180" end="00:23:20.250" style="s2">knowledge for other people because of my</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.250" end="00:23:22.710" style="s2">brain changing I had to allow new things</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.250" end="00:23:25.070" style="s2">to come new things our art like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.710" end="00:23:27.540" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean like that is creating and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.070" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">that&#39;s where the magic happens that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.540" end="00:23:33.050" style="s2">where innovation happens where you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.220" end="00:23:37.770" style="s2">science meets our needs meets it and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.050" end="00:23:40.290" style="s2">yeah thank you and I love that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.770" end="00:23:43.680" style="s2">coming from science because I&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.290" end="00:23:48.860" style="s2">from art fascinated by science so there</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.680" end="00:23:48.860" style="s2">is a real yeah there&#39;s something so</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.790" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something something so huge to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.560" end="00:23:59.610" style="s2">be gained I think when those</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:24:01.230" style="s2">perspectives interweave it is just it</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.610" end="00:24:04.950" style="s2">comes back to the original question it</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.230" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">gives me hope because as a culture we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.950" end="00:24:10.820" style="s2">been really hitting the science hard for</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.740" end="00:24:17.220" style="s2">a long time and to be able to interweave</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.820" end="00:24:20.870" style="s2">that with the heart the embodied sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.220" end="00:24:26.059" style="s2">the emotion the art I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.870" end="00:24:27.530" style="s2">is hopeful if we can do that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.059" end="00:24:28.970" style="s2">and meet people where they&#39;re at cuz</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.530" end="00:24:31.460" style="s2">some people aren&#39;t ready for the heart</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.970" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">space I was a intellectual for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.460" end="00:24:35.570" style="s2">covered up something that I wasn&#39;t ready</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.140" end="00:24:36.980" style="s2">to go into and I&#39;m sure the other way</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.570" end="00:24:38.510" style="s2">too if your intellectual and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.980" end="00:24:39.860" style="s2">like you&#39;re not smart or sorry art you</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.510" end="00:24:41.510" style="s2">know heart bass and you feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.860" end="00:24:43.280" style="s2">not smart enough to get the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.510" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">part you haven&#39;t been told that you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.280" end="00:24:47.990" style="s2">it&#39;s not okay to admit you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:49.790" style="s2">something and that&#39;s where that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.990" end="00:24:51.980" style="s2">like those two inch or whooping is like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.790" end="00:24:53.270" style="s2">meeting people where they are and figure</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.980" end="00:24:55.070" style="s2">out how to help them and relieve it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.270" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">which I think again is loving the more</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.070" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">there at making space for yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:06.050" style="s2">everyone because they can yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:08.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a broader tapestry</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.050" end="00:25:11.960" style="s2">once once there&#39;s a picture of a broader</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.120" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">tapestry not everyone has to fractal the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.960" end="00:25:16.520" style="s2">tapestry right that people can still be</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.860" style="s2">at their poles if that&#39;s where they need</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.520" end="00:25:22.250" style="s2">to be which I can relate that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.860" end="00:25:25.730" style="s2">was for a lot most of my life but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.250" end="00:25:30.020" style="s2">whole is a tapestry that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.730" end="00:25:36.050" style="s2">parts can see that everyone can fit I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.020" end="00:25:38.510" style="s2">think yeah well no and that&#39;s to me like</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.050" end="00:25:40.429" style="s2">I can see how everything in my life led</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.510" end="00:25:42.830" style="s2">up to this point like every interest</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.429" end="00:25:44.330" style="s2">every interaction everything for me to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.830" end="00:25:47.960" style="s2">do what I need to do to create a better</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.330" end="00:25:49.220" style="s2">world and I&#39;m losing my train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.960" end="00:25:51.380" style="s2">as to what I was talking about in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.220" end="00:25:53.750" style="s2">moment but the tapestry it like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.380" end="00:25:55.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not about there&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.750" end="00:25:57.230" style="s2">diversity almost has to be demanded</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.640" end="00:25:59.540" style="s2">right like all spaces have to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.230" end="00:26:02.030" style="s2">inclusive spaces and like I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.540" end="00:26:04.070" style="s2">you see what we get with diversity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.030" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">if you&#39;re demanding people see it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.070" end="00:26:07.730" style="s2">not getting really seen with diversity</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">like it&#39;s that we&#39;re all different we</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.730" end="00:26:11.780" style="s2">all have different for different threads</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:13.190" style="s2">in the tapestry yet we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.780" end="00:26:15.140" style="s2">yelling at each other to be our thread</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.190" end="00:26:17.240" style="s2">or to not be the thread like it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.140" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">weird you know we&#39;re in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.240" end="00:26:22.910" style="s2">other threads it&#39;s like no we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:25.460" style="s2">up the hole and it involves finding that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.910" end="00:26:28.040" style="s2">way to weave us together and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.460" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">gonna involve right left-brain feminine</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.040" end="00:26:33.320" style="s2">masculine all of the binaries that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.520" style="s2">starting to not be by it is that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.320" end="00:26:37.820" style="s2">needs to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.520" end="00:26:41.090" style="s2">unfold and allowing people to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.820" end="00:26:44.600" style="s2">confusion and shame and sad medicine</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.090" end="00:26:48.110" style="s2">like be present with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.600" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">giving them the tools for that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.110" end="00:26:51.260" style="s2">almost at the half an hour mark I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:53.000" style="s2">gonna let you finish up anything you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.260" end="00:26:55.400" style="s2">want to say if there is anything and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.000" end="00:26:57.950" style="s2">then we can stop the going live and then</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.990" end="00:27:20.090" style="s2">people&#39;s consciousness and somehow I</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.970" end="00:27:22.760" style="s2">ended up here today so thank you I also</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:27.890" style="s2">us being here there was a possibility I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.840" end="00:27:29.809" style="s2">was gonna be sitting here all by myself</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.890" end="00:27:31.550" style="s2">and if that happened that&#39;s possibly</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.809" end="00:27:33.860" style="s2">what was supposed to happen but no cuz</p>
