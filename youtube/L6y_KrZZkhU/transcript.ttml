<p begin="00:00:26.670" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">publicly but maybe the best way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:40.100" style="s2">saying it is doing game B and what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">mean by that is finding or using</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.100" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">existing high trust relationships so</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:47.489" style="s2">people who are in a position where they</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">can introduce me to somebody through a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">very high quality first person</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:54.739" style="s2">relationship that is relevant so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">relevance realization x high trust</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.739" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">having conversations to find out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">going on so we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.469" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">sort of the coronavirus and all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">other stuff like finance and education</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">the whole bit yeah finding out if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:09.619" style="s2">imagine there&#39;s a big social graph</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">that&#39;s forming around the problem domain</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.619" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">there&#39;s more or less two moves that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">happening one move is improving our</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">sense making about the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">problem to me but what is it what are</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">the questions and what are the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:22.860" style="s2">the questions relate to each other you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">know for example over the past month</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">there&#39;s been a recognition that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">concept called medical system</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">overwhelmed it&#39;s a problem to remain</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">like it&#39;s a very specific kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of questions that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">have to be asked about that domain there</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">are other problems having to do with</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">with epidemiology how do we model the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:40.290" style="s2">spread of disease and how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">those models better and better there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">whole bunch of people are focused on</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">that problem to me okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">so being aware of the problem domains</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:51.799" style="s2">and then second move is forming the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">network of people in relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.799" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">ideally high trust relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.030" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">high competence relationships so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:02:00.990" style="s2">thing every day okay I and with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">people who I&#39;m currently aware of and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">connected on are working on these things</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">right here I now just discovered a you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">are part of a network over here they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:09.660" style="s2">working on these things how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:11.069" style="s2">the cross connections between these two</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.660" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">so that you guys can stop working on</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.069" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">that because we&#39;ve actually got that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">covered pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:15.660" style="s2">but you guys have got this thing over</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">here that we knew is a problem we</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.660" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">haven&#39;t been thought about and frankly</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:19.019" style="s2">you&#39;re probably better to us than this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">so we&#39;re just gonna drop in let you take</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.019" end="00:02:22.980" style="s2">that over and creating the network</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:24.870" style="s2">connections to base it to work through</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.980" end="00:02:27.300" style="s2">the the bottlenecks and the log jams</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.870" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">that are caused either by simply being</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.300" end="00:02:33.299" style="s2">unaware or by the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:35.099" style="s2">institutions I game a and game B</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.299" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">oftentimes the problems you run into or</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.099" end="00:02:40.709" style="s2">that gaming institutions either can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:43.830" style="s2">see well or can&#39;t make effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.709" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">I mean simple things like my</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.830" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">administrative process for engaging and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:49.950" style="s2">procurement requires that I have net</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">90-day payment and the person who has</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.950" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">the thing I want won&#39;t take NIT a 90 day</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:02:55.170" style="s2">payment and I can&#39;t modify that because</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:56.340" style="s2">I&#39;m in a gaming institution where I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.170" end="00:02:58.799" style="s2">to go up to the vice president all this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.340" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">kind of crap right so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.799" end="00:03:02.910" style="s2">actually start creating game b-style</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">infrastructures human meshwork stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.910" end="00:03:06.060" style="s2">between all the nodes that need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:07.379" style="s2">happen and built on the right stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.060" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s not built on high quality</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.379" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">high competence high trust relationships</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">so getting on the phone and saying who</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">do you know who you know you like spend</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:17.730" style="s2">time in the in the foxhole with that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:19.350" style="s2">know that they will do what they say</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.730" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">with high integrity and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.350" end="00:03:22.590" style="s2">effective and what they&#39;re doing and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:24.510" style="s2">do we actually orient them into a place</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.590" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">where they&#39;re capacitors are most needed</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.510" end="00:03:29.549" style="s2">and where they&#39;re able to have the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:31.799" style="s2">they themselves are able to perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.549" end="00:03:33.630" style="s2">most possibility of adding value so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.799" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">self organization the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.630" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">collective intelligence around an</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">increasing sense making in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">underlying problem domains is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">doing nice I like it I&#39;m glad I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:46.380" style="s2">there&#39;s people focusing on that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">desperately need it</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.380" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve been upfront to it from a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:53.099" style="s2">side of that we&#39;re figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:54.989" style="s2">bring people together to have an</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.099" end="00:03:58.049" style="s2">effective conversation and to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:04:00.329" style="s2">into the world I in the game be space</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.049" end="00:04:02.579" style="s2">and tried many a thing and some of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.329" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">has come to crickets and no one&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.579" end="00:04:05.459" style="s2">me up on it and then other things have</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:07.440" style="s2">been more successful and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.459" end="00:04:09.780" style="s2">go down and be a Vanina sitter that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.440" end="00:04:11.639" style="s2">more successful of course yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.780" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">idea cafe was my baby when I first came</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.639" end="00:04:14.849" style="s2">in and so we&#39;ve been having a few of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:16.500" style="s2">those we just have a weekly one for game</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.849" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">B and that&#39;s just enjoyable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.500" end="00:04:19.650" style="s2">enjoyable people have a space they can</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">have a conversation that has some</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.650" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">structure around it but it&#39;s fallen by</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:24.220" style="s2">the wayside because it&#39;s just not as</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:27.580" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.220" end="00:04:29.500" style="s2">other projects which are we become its</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.580" end="00:04:31.960" style="s2">Bentley and my brother Adriel and I and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.500" end="00:04:34.900" style="s2">yo Nez sometimes where who created</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.960" end="00:04:37.390" style="s2">together Tec and we&#39;re trying to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.900" end="00:04:40.300" style="s2">figure out the meta project of projects</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.390" end="00:04:42.340" style="s2">for getting bees so because that is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.300" end="00:04:43.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get Curtis is people have their</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.340" end="00:04:45.100" style="s2">own project that they&#39;re passionate</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.480" end="00:04:46.750" style="s2">about so getting those people to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.100" end="00:04:49.270" style="s2">together and say how can we create Omni</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.750" end="00:04:50.860" style="s2">with solutions that empower all of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.270" end="00:04:52.470" style="s2">projects right create the marketing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.860" end="00:04:53.980" style="s2">finance how do we create that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.470" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">unfortunately although we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.980" end="00:04:56.890" style="s2">project rate Z and I think you left</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">after project crazies I think you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.890" end="00:05:00.730" style="s2">probably know what project crazy knows</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">or we just focus on one person&#39;s project</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.730" end="00:05:03.940" style="s2">and we crowdsource solutions for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:06.130" style="s2">for them based on what they want to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.940" end="00:05:08.260" style="s2">happen yep there was no shortage of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.130" end="00:05:10.750" style="s2">people who of course wanted there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.260" end="00:05:12.460" style="s2">their own project raised but there was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.750" end="00:05:14.230" style="s2">shortage of people showing up to raise</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.460" end="00:05:15.700" style="s2">other people&#39;s projects so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.230" end="00:05:17.260" style="s2">basically been lady at really night</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.700" end="00:05:18.520" style="s2">raising other girls project so should</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.260" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">enjoyable cuz I love that I love</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.520" end="00:05:22.570" style="s2">listening to people&#39;s ideas and helping</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">them create things that I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.570" end="00:05:26.470" style="s2">have to do the work on right yes you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:28.570" style="s2">see other things on other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.470" end="00:05:30.370" style="s2">projects and so we&#39;re figuring that out</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.570" end="00:05:32.950" style="s2">together how do we get more people there</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.370" end="00:05:34.360" style="s2">we have the Facebook group unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.950" end="00:05:36.790" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t really work</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.360" end="00:05:37.990" style="s2">to to empower individuals and groups and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.790" end="00:05:39.100" style="s2">so people don&#39;t see it and we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.990" end="00:05:39.910" style="s2">to work around that but we&#39;re figuring</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.100" end="00:05:43.450" style="s2">it out together</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.910" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">and during this process I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.450" end="00:05:46.990" style="s2">having generative conversations and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.030" style="s2">after project raising and what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.990" end="00:05:51.160" style="s2">looks like I came up with solution</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.030" end="00:05:54.070" style="s2">raising which we&#39;ve had six of them and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.160" end="00:05:55.540" style="s2">it&#39;s an hour long conversation broken</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.070" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">into three parts we spend 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.540" end="00:06:00.220" style="s2">talking about what is currently done in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:01.150" style="s2">that space so we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.220" end="00:06:02.910" style="s2">education we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.150" end="00:06:05.220" style="s2">transportation we talked about of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.910" end="00:06:07.690" style="s2">infectious diseases we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.220" end="00:06:09.310" style="s2">food and so any may be come up with like</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.690" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">what&#39;s currently done that&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.310" end="00:06:12.430" style="s2">what we talk about so we only spend 15</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:13.690" style="s2">minutes on it because we kind understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.430" end="00:06:15.700" style="s2">what the problem with food is and its</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.690" end="00:06:17.950" style="s2">fragility then we spend 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.700" end="00:06:19.750" style="s2">talking about what our version of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.950" end="00:06:21.100" style="s2">ideal future would look like and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.750" end="00:06:22.810" style="s2">don&#39;t need to match you know Internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.100" end="00:06:25.150" style="s2">vote on them it&#39;s like what would my</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.810" end="00:06:26.950" style="s2">ideal food system look like in a world</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.150" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">however long in the future I need that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.950" end="00:06:30.700" style="s2">to be for it to be feasible for my mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:32.919" style="s2">and then we spend half an hour talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.700" end="00:06:36.370" style="s2">about something we could create right</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.919" end="00:06:37.500" style="s2">now if we had 10,000 people at $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.370" end="00:06:38.910" style="s2">so not some</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.500" end="00:06:40.950" style="s2">we&#39;re like we&#39;re gonna feed everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.910" end="00:06:42.480" style="s2">the planet how if we had 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.950" end="00:06:43.920" style="s2">who wanted to be fed what would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.480" end="00:06:46.140" style="s2">something we could create that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.920" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">help them in that process and after six</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.140" end="00:06:52.140" style="s2">of them every single one has generated</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.480" end="00:06:53.430" style="s2">an amazing solution an amazing thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.140" end="00:06:55.230" style="s2">that we could create and so the next</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.430" end="00:06:57.150" style="s2">thing I&#39;m looking at doing is creating a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.230" end="00:06:58.950" style="s2">solution or a Zenon solution raising how</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.150" end="00:07:00.570" style="s2">do we actually find 10,000 people how do</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.950" end="00:07:02.340" style="s2">we actually because these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.570" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">have only been three to five people they</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.340" end="00:07:05.460" style="s2">haven&#39;t been a hundred people how do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:07.170" style="s2">have this conversation with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.460" end="00:07:08.730" style="s2">people where each one is having their</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.170" end="00:07:11.490" style="s2">own little for Petersons table kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.730" end="00:07:13.080" style="s2">like the idea cafe and then we submit</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.490" end="00:07:15.210" style="s2">them and vote on which one&#39;s the best it</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.080" end="00:07:18.090" style="s2">is not the best way and so actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.210" end="00:07:19.350" style="s2">figuring out how do we now move forward</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.090" end="00:07:21.450" style="s2">with the solution amazing how do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.350" end="00:07:24.360" style="s2">create these ideas together and then how</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.450" end="00:07:25.950" style="s2">do we actually generate them actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.360" end="00:07:28.620" style="s2">yeah yeah so can I say some stuff there</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.950" end="00:07:30.660" style="s2">yeah I was thinking about exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.620" end="00:07:35.660" style="s2">issue right before this call and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.660" end="00:07:37.890" style="s2">last bits last piece yeah so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.660" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">so what you want to be able to do is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.890" end="00:07:41.820" style="s2">find a way to have this thing grow in</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:45.180" style="s2">almost like a rhizomatic fashion the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.820" end="00:07:46.620" style="s2">that uh mushroom mycelium grows we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.180" end="00:07:52.650" style="s2">like to be able to do as habit so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:55.380" style="s2">the the content of the conversation its</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.650" end="00:07:58.050" style="s2">packaged in such a way they can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.380" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">disseminated peer to peer and activate</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.050" end="00:08:02.520" style="s2">people to be to come at it in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:03.870" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s probably a set of waves</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.520" end="00:08:04.950" style="s2">the field Smith is that concentric</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.870" end="00:08:07.979" style="s2">circles like you said there&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.950" end="00:08:11.300" style="s2">certain almost like a design team who</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.979" end="00:08:16.290" style="s2">are you familiar at the Charles purses</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.300" end="00:08:19.229" style="s2">epistemology yeah you know like when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.290" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">play when you play you build a puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.229" end="00:08:22.919" style="s2">you take all the puzzle pieces and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">drop them out of the box and the very</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.919" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">beginning that there&#39;s this first moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:27.510" style="s2">where you really don&#39;t even have a clue</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:28.940" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s going on you just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.510" end="00:08:31.050" style="s2">know there&#39;s a puzzle to be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.940" end="00:08:32.280" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a period of time where</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.050" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">you&#39;re beginning the process of finding</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.280" end="00:08:34.860" style="s2">the edges and kind of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.539" style="s2">outside of and getting a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.860" end="00:08:38.400" style="s2">the pattern is that you have this pop</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.539" end="00:08:40.979" style="s2">like okay now I&#39;m actually in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.400" end="00:08:42.030" style="s2">process of assembling the puzzle and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.979" end="00:08:43.860" style="s2">then there&#39;s a period of time where we</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.030" end="00:08:45.060" style="s2">actually now have a pretty good sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.860" end="00:08:46.260" style="s2">the puzzle you&#39;re just putting pieces in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.060" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">place but you kind of know that the end</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.260" end="00:08:49.290" style="s2">is near I mean you don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.110" style="s2">how close it is does the end he tells</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.290" end="00:08:53.510" style="s2">that first in a second is in third this</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.110" end="00:08:54.710" style="s2">so the face of firstness which feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.510" end="00:08:56.210" style="s2">like it&#39;s a little bit of the first two</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.710" end="00:08:57.830" style="s2">phases you&#39;ve been talking about is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.210" end="00:08:59.270" style="s2">design phase it&#39;s a design when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.830" end="00:09:00.980" style="s2">don&#39;t really know you kind of have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.270" end="00:09:02.420" style="s2">general sense of the domain I&#39;m solving</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.980" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">a puzzle right I&#39;m not building a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.420" end="00:09:06.020" style="s2">bicycle or trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:08.660" style="s2">raise a child which are different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.020" end="00:09:10.670" style="s2">of puzzles and you bring some people in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.660" end="00:09:12.980" style="s2">there who maybe have relevant some</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.670" end="00:09:15.140" style="s2">relevant perspective some relevant</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:16.580" style="s2">expertise ideally some to know highly</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.140" end="00:09:18.200" style="s2">divergent perspectives so you get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.580" end="00:09:19.820" style="s2">of richness in the design process and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.200" end="00:09:21.350" style="s2">they try to do something like getting it</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.820" end="00:09:23.570" style="s2">something in the direction of firstness</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.350" end="00:09:28.190" style="s2">some notion that has got you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.570" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">something like call it 15% of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.190" end="00:09:31.520" style="s2">question domain has been aha and most of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:32.510" style="s2">it may be maybe they meet some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.520" end="00:09:34.300" style="s2">most meaningful questions have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.510" end="00:09:36.230" style="s2">surfaced maybe not necessarily answered</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.300" end="00:09:38.390" style="s2">then you have the second wave of folks</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.230" end="00:09:42.470" style="s2">who come in and they&#39;re basically not</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.390" end="00:09:44.660" style="s2">there to do a whole lot of cracking open</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.470" end="00:09:46.730" style="s2">the frame but they&#39;re mostly there to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.660" end="00:09:48.740" style="s2">make sure to add more meat to them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.730" end="00:09:51.140" style="s2">the start to the structure ask more</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.740" end="00:09:52.610" style="s2">specific questions modify questions that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.140" end="00:09:54.350" style="s2">haven&#39;t been asked the right way and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.610" end="00:09:55.370" style="s2">build a little more framework around it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.350" end="00:09:58.010" style="s2">so you get to something like on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:10:00.050" style="s2">order of like it&#39;s 85% this is a viable</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.010" end="00:10:02.300" style="s2">solution that this could work it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.050" end="00:10:03.620" style="s2">all the way but it could work then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.300" end="00:10:04.970" style="s2">got the third piece right the third</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.620" end="00:10:06.470" style="s2">piece is where you&#39;re doing that last</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.970" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">mile which is you know from Pareto rule</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.470" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">the last 20% still 80% of the work a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:12.350" style="s2">of details have to be filled in to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:13.640" style="s2">sure you&#39;re uncovering situations that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.350" end="00:10:15.560" style="s2">you didn&#39;t see they can be able to be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.640" end="00:10:17.480" style="s2">problem but a lot of us also actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.560" end="00:10:19.990" style="s2">building out on a p2p basis having</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">conversations with people to enroll that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.990" end="00:10:24.170" style="s2">1000 once you got to 1,000 the 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:26.660" style="s2">will come automatically</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.170" end="00:10:27.890" style="s2">but the 1000 is the product is a process</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.660" end="00:10:29.150" style="s2">that third stage and how do you find</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.890" end="00:10:31.430" style="s2">those people how do you find people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.150" end="00:10:33.140" style="s2">are sitting in the middle of this domain</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.430" end="00:10:35.420" style="s2">but are not yet connected to your</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.140" end="00:10:36.890" style="s2">network and our leaders right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.420" end="00:10:38.090" style="s2">there they they cannot help but be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.890" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">leaders because that&#39;s just who they are</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.090" end="00:10:41.390" style="s2">their disposition their attitude their</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.510" style="s2">motivation their with other people</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.390" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">relate to them so they see this design</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.510" end="00:10:46.700" style="s2">and hopefully you&#39;ve done a good job so</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:48.260" style="s2">when they see their son like yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.700" end="00:10:48.680" style="s2">a good good design I get it that makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.260" end="00:10:51.290" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.680" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">I&#39;d like to see that and you you begin</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.290" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">the process of enrolling those people in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:58.250" style="s2">that loop that larger circle and having</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:59.750" style="s2">conversations that that just kind of has</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.250" end="00:11:01.820" style="s2">them feel heard right they you want them</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.750" end="00:11:03.530" style="s2">to actually have a sense of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.820" end="00:11:05.160" style="s2">that I&#39;m holding that maybe isn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.530" end="00:11:06.870" style="s2">here is now in here</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.160" end="00:11:08.850" style="s2">and now I can now now I am no longer</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.870" end="00:11:09.840" style="s2">equivocal now I can actually what would</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.850" end="00:11:11.850" style="s2">it take for you to move from being</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.840" end="00:11:13.410" style="s2">interested to being committed in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.850" end="00:11:15.090" style="s2">what would make it a whole solution that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.410" end="00:11:16.350" style="s2">your wholeness but everything you care</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.090" end="00:11:17.520" style="s2">about is in this at least with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.350" end="00:11:18.750" style="s2">this domain and we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.520" end="00:11:20.700" style="s2">solve all the problems in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.750" end="00:11:21.780" style="s2">but within this domain you feel really</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.700" end="00:11:24.630" style="s2">good about it okay great</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.780" end="00:11:27.030" style="s2">can we find a finally a thing where we</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.630" end="00:11:29.010" style="s2">get wholeness a closure where we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.030" end="00:11:30.630" style="s2">a people around it that have enough and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.010" end="00:11:32.220" style="s2">then it&#39;s just a very simple that last</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.630" end="00:11:33.480" style="s2">step is very simple but you have each of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.220" end="00:11:36.600" style="s2">those thousand people say okay get ten</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.480" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">people you know they&#39;ve been talking to</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.600" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">you for a while about this and if all</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:40.380" style="s2">you do is you tell them this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:42.780" style="s2">right solution I&#39;d like you to sign up</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:43.800" style="s2">and this is what it takes and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.780" end="00:11:45.540" style="s2">just a little skin in the game because</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">ten people times $10 ten thousand times</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.540" end="00:11:51.750" style="s2">ten dollars a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">exactly and if you got a good design</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.750" end="00:11:55.980" style="s2">it&#39;s been been vetted and socialized as</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:11:57.870" style="s2">it goes to this process and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.980" end="00:12:00.210" style="s2">thousand people who are leaders in their</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.870" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">sub domain who care about this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.210" end="00:12:04.500" style="s2">they validated it themselves I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:05.790" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of done so the hard part is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.500" end="00:12:07.290" style="s2">actually each of those steps and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.790" end="00:12:08.490" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.290" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">through step one and step two to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.490" end="00:12:12.270" style="s2">level you&#39;ve got some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:13.530" style="s2">and figuring out that third one is funny</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.270" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">now you know you did the matter or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.530" end="00:12:17.880" style="s2">just I&#39;m doing the matter you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:20.100" style="s2">the thing about the thing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.880" end="00:12:21.450" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with there&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.100" end="00:12:23.880" style="s2">doing it both from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.450" end="00:12:25.260" style="s2">a concrete domain say like food we</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.880" end="00:12:27.030" style="s2">actually also doing at a meta domain</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.260" end="00:12:27.900" style="s2">which is how do we do this thing how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.030" end="00:12:29.790" style="s2">we do this first and second</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.900" end="00:12:31.140" style="s2">assertiveness process so all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.790" end="00:12:34.770" style="s2">everybody&#39;s probably engaged right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.140" end="00:12:35.850" style="s2">is probably looking at both a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.770" end="00:12:37.350" style="s2">things that came up for me I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.850" end="00:12:39.150" style="s2">what I&#39;m about to say is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.350" end="00:12:40.260" style="s2">because I think there may be I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.150" end="00:12:41.490" style="s2">operating in a very different</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.260" end="00:12:45.270" style="s2">environment right now sit which has</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.490" end="00:12:49.830" style="s2">different tensors on it what I can say</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.270" end="00:12:52.770" style="s2">is there&#39;s certain kinds of dispositions</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.830" end="00:12:54.180" style="s2">and certain kinds of relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.770" end="00:12:55.650" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s very hard for me to keep this</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.180" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">phone strain you turn it maybe it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.650" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">a whole little easier there we go</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">there&#39;s just a lot easier to do things</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:09.810" style="s2">with there&#39;s just people who are capable</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:11.340" style="s2">of having conversations and have</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.810" end="00:13:12.780" style="s2">disciplines of mind and their</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.340" end="00:13:15.510" style="s2">disposition so they hear what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.780" end="00:13:16.730" style="s2">said and they don&#39;t grab a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.510" end="00:13:19.010" style="s2">to try to load it with their own</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.730" end="00:13:20.990" style="s2">preferences</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.010" end="00:13:22.490" style="s2">start just meandering off in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.990" end="00:13:23.779" style="s2">of nowhere because it&#39;s what is in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.490" end="00:13:25.490" style="s2">mind right now the people who have just</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.779" end="00:13:27.170" style="s2">a certain unless you knew what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.490" end="00:13:28.760" style="s2">happening I&#39;m focusing on what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.170" end="00:13:31.700" style="s2">talked about right now I have an</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.760" end="00:13:34.520" style="s2">internal capacity to not put signal or</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.700" end="00:13:36.740" style="s2">noise into the environment and if I make</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.520" end="00:13:38.570" style="s2">an agreement it&#39;s an agreement like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.740" end="00:13:39.980" style="s2">not I&#39;m not going to fail to do what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.570" end="00:13:44.600" style="s2">just said I have integrity and my</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.980" end="00:13:46.490" style="s2">capacity to make agreements and if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.600" end="00:13:49.910" style="s2">build this kind of thing out of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.490" end="00:13:51.529" style="s2">people it&#39;s it&#39;s very real because if</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.910" end="00:13:54.130" style="s2">they if they&#39;ve said they&#39;re gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.529" end="00:13:56.360" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna and that tells you a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.130" end="00:13:57.560" style="s2">unfortunately there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.360" end="00:14:01.070" style="s2">people particularly people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.560" end="00:14:04.190" style="s2">attracted to it&#39;s call it change making</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.070" end="00:14:07.220" style="s2">or to idea space who don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.190" end="00:14:08.600" style="s2">characteristics and that&#39;s so and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.220" end="00:14:11.180" style="s2">think that makes sense because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.600" end="00:14:12.980" style="s2">necessity like oak trait openness has</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.180" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">you need to have trade openness to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.980" end="00:14:18.170" style="s2">consider firstness to consider brand new</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.910" style="s2">ideas yeah just think think outside the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.170" end="00:14:21.110" style="s2">box that&#39;s a whole different policy the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.910" end="00:14:22.339" style="s2">problem one of the problems I&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.110" end="00:14:24.410" style="s2">is that people who have that trait that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.339" end="00:14:26.060" style="s2">are so valuable in the first phase and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.410" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">they&#39;re being really problematic in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">second phase because once the shiny</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:31.130" style="s2">objects not so shiny anymore they</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:32.899" style="s2">started going off looking for the next</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.130" end="00:14:34.459" style="s2">shiny thing and to be perfectly frank</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.899" end="00:14:36.620" style="s2">quite often their ability to make an</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.459" end="00:14:38.300" style="s2">agreement and commit to it goes down so</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.620" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like a demographic shift we</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.300" end="00:14:42.020" style="s2">actually want to have the designer phase</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:44.180" style="s2">be people who are ready willing and able</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.020" end="00:14:45.470" style="s2">to think outside the box but somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.180" end="00:14:46.579" style="s2">in that second page you want to start</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.470" end="00:14:48.500" style="s2">rolling that we have a high</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.579" end="00:14:50.779" style="s2">conscientiousness and they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.500" end="00:14:51.980" style="s2">kind of they&#39;ll call a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.779" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">because when they make an agreement they</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.980" end="00:14:54.589" style="s2">they&#39;re committing to it so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:56.870" style="s2">gonna be the guys are actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.589" end="00:14:58.790" style="s2">crack open the idea and say yeah access</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.870" end="00:15:00.290" style="s2">smells like to me it&#39;s this thing I</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.790" end="00:15:00.709" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you guys are talking us</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.290" end="00:15:02.870" style="s2">you actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.709" end="00:15:04.670" style="s2">you know you get pushed by those people</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.870" end="00:15:06.890" style="s2">and that&#39;s good because then you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.670" end="00:15:08.390" style="s2">you have a better design and and then if</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.890" end="00:15:10.640" style="s2">you get them enrolled then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.390" end="00:15:12.829" style="s2">like this the the folks who make things</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.640" end="00:15:15.560" style="s2">happen that make any sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.829" end="00:15:17.029" style="s2">absolutely I mean it&#39;s a little weird</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.560" end="00:15:18.410" style="s2">because I might be one of those like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.029" end="00:15:19.970" style="s2">like right I kind of like the shiny</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.410" end="00:15:22.010" style="s2">object and I really like having the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.970" end="00:15:23.959" style="s2">conversations that are generative and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.010" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">don&#39;t even have the capacity necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.959" end="00:15:28.430" style="s2">to do the actual physical work like</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:29.750" style="s2">actual physical world kind of digging</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.540" end="00:16:27.140" style="s2">were no longer bound to extended</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.730" end="00:16:28.940" style="s2">families in the place that we were born</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.140" end="00:16:30.470" style="s2">because we could move and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.940" end="00:16:31.970" style="s2">because we in fact as many as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.470" end="00:16:33.410" style="s2">needed to move because the jobs were</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.970" end="00:16:35.450" style="s2">better elsewhere whether it was leaving</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.410" end="00:16:36.950" style="s2">the small town to go to the city or was</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.450" end="00:16:38.779" style="s2">leaving the family go to the university</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.950" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">or now in the modern era we could just</p>

<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:44.029" style="s2">environments maybe talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.329" end="00:16:46.220" style="s2">around us has actually exacerbated that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.029" end="00:16:49.300" style="s2">severing and were the people who have</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.220" end="00:16:54.140" style="s2">more in the direction of trade openness</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.300" end="00:16:56.089" style="s2">gravitate more towards exciting visceral</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.089" end="00:16:59.240" style="s2">new and so they tend to go to places</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.950" end="00:17:00.529" style="s2">where new happens to be and hang out</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.240" end="00:17:02.570" style="s2">with other people who like new stuffs</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.529" end="00:17:04.280" style="s2">it&#39;s been less time and interacting with</p>

<p begin="00:17:04.280" end="00:17:07.220" style="s2">conscientiousness so you get these</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.809" end="00:17:08.900" style="s2">actual device in the device actually end</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.220" end="00:17:12.410" style="s2">up being dispositional device they even</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.900" end="00:17:13.550" style="s2">become loaded political divides because</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.410" end="00:17:15.319" style="s2">they have different contexts different</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.550" end="00:17:18.350" style="s2">Spearin PSA&#39;s and different expectations</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.319" end="00:17:19.550" style="s2">of what right choice looks like and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.350" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">of course the political divides become</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.550" end="00:17:26.870" style="s2">resentments and then resentments become</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:28.370" style="s2">conflicts so if you can find a way and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.870" end="00:17:31.400" style="s2">certainly am participating in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.370" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">myself quite a bit but to reconnect</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.400" end="00:17:34.730" style="s2">those things that&#39;s the fabric out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">which reality is made is to get the</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.169" end="00:17:45.980" style="s2">said ok tribe you&#39;re going to have six</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.450" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">of these kind of folks and 15 of these</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.660" style="s2">two of these in one of these that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.650" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">good chunk that group of people can</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.810" end="00:17:57.050" style="s2">the box and can plan effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.340" end="00:17:59.030" style="s2">make sure everybody&#39;s heard like all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.050" end="00:18:00.740" style="s2">different aspects and capacities so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.030" end="00:18:01.640" style="s2">creating this sort of cross-functional</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.740" end="00:18:03.650" style="s2">and by functional and literally</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.640" end="00:18:05.780" style="s2">dispositional teams and figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.650" end="00:18:07.040" style="s2">to get those teams to be coherent with</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.120" end="00:18:24.290" style="s2">commitments there are actual life</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.610" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">experience differentials and then their</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.290" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">biological differentials at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">disposition like that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.350" end="00:18:30.500" style="s2">distance between them we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:32.390" style="s2">to cover all that distance to actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.500" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">ground things so the right elements are</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.390" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">in place to really really do big stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.940" end="00:18:41.930" style="s2">yeah sorry so that&#39;s that&#39;s uh something</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.800" end="00:18:43.340" style="s2">I have to say about that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.930" end="00:18:45.770" style="s2">appreciate that I don&#39;t know if I got it</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.340" end="00:18:48.560" style="s2">all but I can watch the replay see see</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.770" end="00:18:50.120" style="s2">what I got but ya know it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.560" end="00:18:52.760" style="s2">what I what I have to deal with and work</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.120" end="00:18:54.440" style="s2">with is that like we have conflict we</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.760" end="00:18:56.180" style="s2">have personality conflicts at the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.440" end="00:18:58.970" style="s2">time a lot of people are focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.180" end="00:19:01.580" style="s2">getting rid of them are working not even</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.970" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">really working with them whereas I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.580" end="00:19:05.480" style="s2">like right now during this Cove in</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:07.750" style="s2">nineteen thing we can see how the left</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.480" end="00:19:11.150" style="s2">and the right have very different</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.750" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">first-order values but we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.150" end="00:19:14.660" style="s2">much more similar than we are different</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:16.490" style="s2">like the left is like close the border</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.660" end="00:19:18.500" style="s2">close the border and the right is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.490" end="00:19:21.830" style="s2">so we need universal basic income</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.500" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">because how do we pay for things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.830" end="00:19:25.790" style="s2">like even the left and I&#39;m also like</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:27.860" style="s2">close the border all open borders but</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.790" end="00:19:29.540" style="s2">not turn in a pandemic like close the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.860" end="00:19:32.540" style="s2">city is closed let&#39;s figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.540" end="00:19:34.520" style="s2">yeah and so to be able to look at we</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.540" end="00:19:36.530" style="s2">have different values when I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.520" end="00:19:39.020" style="s2">to decide on what your values are but if</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.530" end="00:19:40.970" style="s2">we can find a common goal we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.020" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">to necessarily agree on the value like</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.970" end="00:19:45.320" style="s2">if what we&#39;re doing is solving food most</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:47.240" style="s2">of us can agree that we want to eat and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.320" end="00:19:49.100" style="s2">that we want other people to eat so how</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.240" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">do we get people fed instead of a green</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.100" end="00:19:52.760" style="s2">on are we gonna go vegan are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:53.870" style="s2">like it&#39;s like I don&#39;t care how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.760" end="00:19:55.100" style="s2">get people fed how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.870" end="00:19:57.180" style="s2">there&#39;s enough calories and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.100" end="00:19:58.680" style="s2">make sure you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.180" end="00:20:01.050" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting so it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.680" end="00:20:02.310" style="s2">because it&#39;s well let&#39;s take this take</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.050" end="00:20:03.720" style="s2">that conversation there&#39;s two pieces</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.310" end="00:20:04.890" style="s2">Tuesday just pop in my head as you were</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.720" end="00:20:06.210" style="s2">saying it so what is this dish that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.890" end="00:20:10.020" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go vegan and what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.210" end="00:20:13.470" style="s2">do is I wanted to distinguish our our</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.020" end="00:20:14.370" style="s2">values from our ends and Daniel is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.470" end="00:20:15.480" style="s2">smacking burger and I had this</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.370" end="00:20:18.540" style="s2">conversation all the time because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.480" end="00:20:19.980" style="s2">vegan and I&#39;m not right now he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.540" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">that he&#39;s not the kind of vegan he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.980" end="00:20:24.990" style="s2">like radix weaken but so we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">it and at the bottom and it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.990" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">okay where do where do our values align</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:32.490" style="s2">because we&#39;re our values align we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">actually get stuff done and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.490" end="00:20:35.310" style="s2">work forward so let&#39;s not fight about</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:37.050" style="s2">where our value is different that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.310" end="00:20:39.780" style="s2">worry about where our values align where</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.050" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">they align our factory farms got to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.780" end="00:20:42.570" style="s2">that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:44.340" style="s2">I&#39;m done you don&#39;t have to go fine great</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.570" end="00:20:45.870" style="s2">animal testing great this dudes</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.340" end="00:20:47.790" style="s2">give her that too it&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.870" end="00:20:48.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work scientifically I mean as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.790" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">holdat so we can actually take a whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.930" end="00:20:52.920" style="s2">bunch of things like where do our values</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.150" style="s2">align kind of work our way back find</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.920" end="00:20:55.680" style="s2">that place where the values are actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.150" end="00:20:57.960" style="s2">synergistic and that what happens is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.680" end="00:20:59.910" style="s2">get the real power because I come to my</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.960" end="00:21:01.980" style="s2">perspective on the basis of my values in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.910" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">my life experience which means I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.980" end="00:21:05.640" style="s2">something that I see something that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:08.130" style="s2">can ground he&#39;s doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.640" end="00:21:10.710" style="s2">okay so if there&#39;s a place where we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.130" end="00:21:11.910" style="s2">a shared shared of values of Lineman</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.710" end="00:21:13.800" style="s2">then what happens is that our</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.910" end="00:21:15.240" style="s2">differentials of life experience give us</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.800" end="00:21:17.430" style="s2">much more capacity to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.240" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">sense of that environment and we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.430" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">actually then create a program that will</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:24.090" style="s2">be much more more robust it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">carefully thought through and more</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.090" end="00:21:28.650" style="s2">likely to be successful because more</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:30.090" style="s2">people it&#39;ll make sense to yes so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.650" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">that&#39;s powerful right if you can pull</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.090" end="00:21:35.670" style="s2">that off but it&#39;s crucial it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:37.950" style="s2">guy Joe Adelman I guess you may know</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.670" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">where I&#39;ve heard of he he did a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.950" end="00:21:44.160" style="s2">work on this back got about 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">where he noticed that and this I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.160" end="00:21:48.470" style="s2">is now known as known in scientific</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:52.020" style="s2">literature that people are quite poor at</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.470" end="00:21:53.850" style="s2">being able to distinguish between what</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.020" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">they think they want and what they</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.850" end="00:21:58.310" style="s2">actually want so even simple stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:22:03.330" style="s2">I&#39;m thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.310" end="00:22:05.160" style="s2">but I want a candy bar because I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.330" end="00:22:07.770" style="s2">actually built high quality sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.160" end="00:22:10.169" style="s2">to my real underlying experience so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.770" end="00:22:11.970" style="s2">just kind of got a body sensitivity of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.169" end="00:22:13.889" style="s2">need and then my brain just</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.970" end="00:22:16.200" style="s2">short-circuits to junk food because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.889" end="00:22:17.639" style="s2">got bad habits we got a lot of them were</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.200" end="00:22:18.929" style="s2">really really bad it actually get</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.639" end="00:22:20.129" style="s2">finding out what our wants are and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.929" end="00:22:21.330" style="s2">actually grab a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.129" end="00:22:23.009" style="s2">out that they don&#39;t said of or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.330" end="00:22:24.119" style="s2">thirsty and I want a coke that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.009" end="00:22:26.129" style="s2">better it&#39;s even more straight to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.119" end="00:22:27.570" style="s2">point my body&#39;s saying I&#39;m thirsty what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.129" end="00:22:28.830" style="s2">I do is I grab a coke because I&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.570" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">of trained myself to match those two</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.830" end="00:22:32.309" style="s2">even though it&#39;s not a good match so</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:34.980" style="s2">actually quite bad at mashing what we</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.309" end="00:22:37.019" style="s2">want was what we think we want and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.980" end="00:22:40.950" style="s2">even worse imagine what we need was what</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.019" end="00:22:46.019" style="s2">we want and so in that case is something</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.950" end="00:22:48.739" style="s2">like how&#39;s this me see if I can put</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.019" end="00:22:53.820" style="s2">concretions makes it make no sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.739" end="00:23:00.929" style="s2">alright so I&#39;m I&#39;m hungry so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.820" end="00:23:03.779" style="s2">want a lunchable but what I need is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.929" end="00:23:06.239" style="s2">nutrition and so I have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.779" end="00:23:09.149" style="s2">think back to recognize oh I need</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.239" end="00:23:11.190" style="s2">nutrition and while I and while I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.149" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">noticed that my one is hunger I actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.190" end="00:23:13.859" style="s2">have to be much more careful about</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">noticing what is the nutrition really</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.859" end="00:23:18.210" style="s2">require here is it more carbs or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:20.009" style="s2">not maybe that&#39;s like Seth I&#39;m still not</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.210" end="00:23:21.570" style="s2">quite there what is it that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.009" end="00:23:23.309" style="s2">needed the lower levels so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.570" end="00:23:24.539" style="s2">actually work our way back I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.309" end="00:23:27.570" style="s2">this in the same context in the notion</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.539" end="00:23:31.049" style="s2">of values differentials that slow down</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.570" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">if you&#39;ve chosen the artifact of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.049" end="00:23:37.649" style="s2">satisfying the values of not harming</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:39.779" style="s2">other sentient beings or even the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.649" end="00:23:41.970" style="s2">value of caring you have a deep value of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.779" end="00:23:44.460" style="s2">caring and the almost I have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.970" end="00:23:46.259" style="s2">subsidiary valuing want of not harming</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.460" end="00:23:48.179" style="s2">other sentient beings and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.259" end="00:23:50.879" style="s2">a notion of how to satisfy that one the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.179" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">form of veganism know what that stack is</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.879" end="00:23:55.529" style="s2">like because we get all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:58.289" style="s2">caring yeah I care too I share that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.529" end="00:24:00.869" style="s2">value I share the value of caring now</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.289" end="00:24:03.239" style="s2">okay you now have the want of not harm</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.869" end="00:24:06.269" style="s2">all sentient beings I&#39;m gonna say well</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.239" end="00:24:08.009" style="s2">does that include like gnats and ticks</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.269" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">cuz I don&#39;t know sure that I share that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.009" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">with you let&#39;s keep working back right</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:13.710" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get a point where my value</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">of caring your value of caring will</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.710" end="00:24:18.210" style="s2">manifest as a shared set of wants then</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:19.649" style="s2">we can start collaborating on the thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.210" end="00:24:23.099" style="s2">at the very end it was how do we satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.649" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">that yeah that&#39;s a powerful technique if</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.099" end="00:24:25.590" style="s2">you can do it because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:26.850" style="s2">helps people slow down and separate in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.590" end="00:24:28.770" style="s2">their own mind because we often get very</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.850" end="00:24:30.930" style="s2">confused about that we actually tend to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.770" end="00:24:32.970" style="s2">flip it thinking very attached to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.930" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">wheat means of satisfaction as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.970" end="00:24:39.210" style="s2">to the actual source of value yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:42.060" style="s2">definitely a difficult I mean I have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.210" end="00:24:43.290" style="s2">slightly different take on that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.060" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the how they that</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.290" end="00:24:46.710" style="s2">they&#39;re they don&#39;t know what they want</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.090" end="00:24:47.970" style="s2">the best way for them to know that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.710" end="00:24:49.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they want is somewhat to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.970" end="00:24:51.900" style="s2">give them what they want right like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.620" end="00:24:53.670" style="s2">be happy when I&#39;m in a relationship we</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.900" end="00:24:55.140" style="s2">could just make them in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.670" end="00:24:56.910" style="s2">they would know that that actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.140" end="00:24:59.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t equal happiness you&#39;re still you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.910" end="00:25:00.990" style="s2">in that relationship but there still</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.820" end="00:25:01.860" style="s2">needs to be a certain amount because</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.990" end="00:25:03.510" style="s2">then you&#39;re in that relationship you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.860" end="00:25:05.220" style="s2">like that&#39;s a wrong relationship I need</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.510" end="00:25:06.780" style="s2">this other perfect relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.220" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">there&#39;s always that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.780" end="00:25:10.890" style="s2">some amount of awareness to just know</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:12.810" style="s2">whether you&#39;re happy in it to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.890" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">do actually this wasn&#39;t the solution and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.810" end="00:25:16.560" style="s2">it just kind of drill down into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:17.670" style="s2">relationship itself like relationships</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.560" end="00:25:19.080" style="s2">are the best crucible for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.670" end="00:25:20.940" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re having you know how</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.080" end="00:25:23.670" style="s2">often does it happen well your partner</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.940" end="00:25:26.190" style="s2">in a relationship claims that so in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.670" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">case she in your case I don&#39;t know she</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.190" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">were he another clue</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.100" end="00:25:38.370" style="s2">so my partner she may say that she wants</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.820" end="00:25:40.710" style="s2">X whatever it is right yeah but after</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.370" end="00:25:42.600" style="s2">really deliberating on it you know come</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.710" end="00:25:44.160" style="s2">down to it&#39;s like oh she wants to feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.600" end="00:25:45.480" style="s2">hurt at the end of the day that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.160" end="00:25:47.370" style="s2">actually what she wants and when she</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.480" end="00:25:49.980" style="s2">feels her like a whole energy level goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.370" end="00:25:52.740" style="s2">down and then it turns out that X was an</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.980" end="00:25:54.210" style="s2">artifact not really the thing but there</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.740" end="00:25:55.530" style="s2">is the thing Y there&#39;s a thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.210" end="00:25:56.790" style="s2">that we can actually get to but until</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.530" end="00:25:58.980" style="s2">you actually get to the deep the deep</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.790" end="00:26:00.450" style="s2">stuff where the Energy&#39;s coming up you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.980" end="00:26:02.490" style="s2">can&#39;t actually get to them to the and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.450" end="00:26:03.810" style="s2">frankly oftentimes very easy thing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.490" end="00:26:05.550" style="s2">if you just both put your mind until you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.810" end="00:26:07.350" style="s2">can actually resolve so that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.550" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">happens all the time like we we take the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.350" end="00:26:11.790" style="s2">energy and instead of listening to what</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:13.980" style="s2">the energy is in its depth we put all</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.790" end="00:26:15.660" style="s2">that energy out here in some object then</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.980" end="00:26:16.650" style="s2">we get very attached to that object as</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.650" end="00:26:19.530" style="s2">solves the problem and makes the problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.360" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">worse because it&#39;s not working and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.530" end="00:26:24.180" style="s2">the energy just keeps building up yes</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.529" end="00:26:45.990" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s all built of the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.299" end="00:26:48.330" style="s2">material yeah yeah it&#39;s grounding this</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.990" end="00:26:49.620" style="s2">is a very like there&#39;s only right now</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.100" end="00:28:05.190" style="s2">this in this timeline but in the I</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:07.260" style="s2">talked about exactly that issues we</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.190" end="00:28:10.470" style="s2">almost have these two worlds the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.260" end="00:28:13.110" style="s2">of scarcity where if your job goes away</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.470" end="00:28:14.549" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;re worthless and we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.110" end="00:28:17.220" style="s2">suddenly we have this bizarre thing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.549" end="00:28:18.389" style="s2">other people are in fact dangerous like</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.220" end="00:28:20.789" style="s2">we&#39;re really concerned about other</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.389" end="00:28:22.230" style="s2">people taking our stuff yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.789" end="00:28:24.299" style="s2">and then we have the realm abundance</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.230" end="00:28:26.700" style="s2">where other people are just important</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.299" end="00:28:30.120" style="s2">for being under people and there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.700" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">always potential collaborators and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.120" end="00:28:34.620" style="s2">live right on the razor&#39;s edge of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.940" style="s2">and in the contemporary context I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.620" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">because I&#39;m looking at so many different</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.940" end="00:28:40.950" style="s2">things and you know this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:43.049" style="s2">something like a ubi construct has been</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.950" end="00:28:45.299" style="s2">not talked about and maybe even has been</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.049" end="00:28:47.070" style="s2">delivered in certain domains even if</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.299" end="00:28:49.470" style="s2">it&#39;s fifteen hundred bucks one time or</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.070" end="00:28:51.630" style="s2">whatever and I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.470" end="00:28:55.230" style="s2">this but I actually was working on that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.630" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">concept 11 years ago and was proposing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.230" end="00:29:00.060" style="s2">it as the thing 11 years ago so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:01.080" style="s2">lot of underlying techniques and math</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.060" end="00:29:03.690" style="s2">and models for it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.080" end="00:29:05.040" style="s2">so I dusted that off about two weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.690" end="00:29:07.350" style="s2">I started taking a look at it and I got</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.040" end="00:29:08.790" style="s2">to tell you right now if we chose to if</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.350" end="00:29:11.970" style="s2">we all sort of collectively said we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.790" end="00:29:14.820" style="s2">like to do it this way we could deliver</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.970" end="00:29:16.200" style="s2">every single person and now I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.820" end="00:29:17.610" style="s2">talking about America cuz I did the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.200" end="00:29:20.550" style="s2">magic in the context of this nation</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.610" end="00:29:23.790" style="s2">state but it applies anywhere but in USD</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.550" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">in the US every single person $2,500 a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.790" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">month of basic income and in addition</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:36.270" style="s2">$1,400 a month the basic health you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:38.220" style="s2">there&#39;s two different constructs easily</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.270" end="00:29:42.690" style="s2">like it isn&#39;t it actually makes</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.220" end="00:29:45.750" style="s2">everything work better that changes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.690" end="00:29:48.210" style="s2">lot right that&#39;s a very very so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.750" end="00:29:49.350" style="s2">saying about that is it&#39;s like it&#39;s keen</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.210" end="00:29:50.700" style="s2">to my mind because you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.350" end="00:29:51.960" style="s2">about in the context to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.700" end="00:29:55.080" style="s2">people are about to discover that their</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.960" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">their jobs aren&#39;t needed and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.080" end="00:30:01.470" style="s2">professions aren&#39;t needed and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:03.470" style="s2">gonna put them in to really bad places</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.470" end="00:30:05.940" style="s2">one place is they&#39;re going to be in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.470" end="00:30:07.140" style="s2">privation because we don&#39;t have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.940" end="00:30:08.970" style="s2">giving people what they need unless</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">their jobs are needed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.970" end="00:30:13.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna put in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:15.180" style="s2">existential written dread I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.620" end="00:30:16.560" style="s2">needed and how do I know that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.180" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">needed well I&#39;m starving people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.560" end="00:30:20.490" style="s2">taking care of me yeah so I&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">fact that I feel it because my identity</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.490" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">just got shattered is being reinforced</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:26.730" style="s2">by the fact that I&#39;m actually in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">existential risk well that&#39;s on this</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.730" end="00:30:30.030" style="s2">left-hand side if we flip to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">right-hand side which we could just do</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.030" end="00:30:33.480" style="s2">not only are you no longer an</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.010" end="00:30:35.460" style="s2">existential risk look we could just take</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.480" end="00:30:36.780" style="s2">care of you it&#39;s real easy we could all</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.460" end="00:30:39.480" style="s2">take care of each other the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.780" end="00:30:42.690" style="s2">for doing that is very high and then by</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.480" end="00:30:44.400" style="s2">the way we care for you and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.690" end="00:30:45.750" style="s2">the whole reason why we&#39;re caring for is</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.400" end="00:30:48.210" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually valuable as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.750" end="00:30:49.740" style="s2">purse and thanks God you&#39;re not doing</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.130" end="00:30:58.950" style="s2">doing things that are wasting your life</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.390" end="00:31:01.890" style="s2">on this earth it&#39;s a very rare and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.950" end="00:31:03.660" style="s2">precious thing so we&#39;re gonna care for</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.890" end="00:31:05.130" style="s2">you so you don&#39;t have to worry about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.660" end="00:31:05.280" style="s2">and now we&#39;re going to try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.130" end="00:31:07.050" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.280" end="00:31:09.570" style="s2">help you get engaged and doing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.050" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re here to do like we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.570" end="00:31:13.650" style="s2">there like this could happen this happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:17.310" style="s2">in months if we put our minds to it ya</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.650" end="00:31:18.660" style="s2">know and that is that is again I got a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.310" end="00:31:20.580" style="s2">little bit of what you were doing and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.660" end="00:31:22.530" style="s2">now know if it was 11 years ago that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.580" end="00:31:24.330" style="s2">a very different time than doing it now</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.530" end="00:31:26.220" style="s2">right when David introduced it yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.330" end="00:31:29.070" style="s2">I think about perception when you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.220" end="00:31:32.160" style="s2">like actually it&#39;s not yet work but so</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.070" end="00:31:34.740" style="s2">talk about it too much but like I love</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.160" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">the idea of you bi and I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:37.620" style="s2">we did have enough people coming from</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:40.050" style="s2">the bottom we could recreate something</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.620" end="00:31:41.580" style="s2">very easily again a million people would</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.050" end="00:31:42.840" style="s2">be like yes I want you be islets figure</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.580" end="00:31:43.080" style="s2">it out let&#39;s figure out what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.840" end="00:31:44.100" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.080" end="00:31:45.570" style="s2">let&#39;s figure out what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.100" end="00:31:47.220" style="s2">without our governments necessarily need</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.570" end="00:31:48.300" style="s2">to be involved that&#39;s a little harder to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.220" end="00:31:50.430" style="s2">need to print the money and get that out</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.300" end="00:31:51.900" style="s2">if it&#39;s in US dollars but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.430" end="00:31:54.090" style="s2">possibility that didn&#39;t exist eleven</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.900" end="00:31:56.280" style="s2">years ago which is cryptocurrency and</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.280" end="00:32:01.110" style="s2">are the solution but something we create</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.010" end="00:32:02.760" style="s2">together that&#39;s designed like ubi that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.110" end="00:32:04.380" style="s2">is designed that it&#39;s generated to and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.760" end="00:32:06.780" style="s2">we agree to make it an exchange between</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.380" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">us is something we can absolutely do</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.780" end="00:32:10.500" style="s2">much more easily than someone coming up</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:13.530" style="s2">with a disseminating it&#39;s everyone yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.500" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">yeah I love my guys overran</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.530" end="00:32:16.650" style="s2">cryptocurrency because they&#39;ve solved</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:18.270" style="s2">that first this in the second s we</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.650" end="00:32:20.460" style="s2">haven&#39;t got to the third dish yet but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.270" end="00:32:23.400" style="s2">the notion that we the people could just</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.460" end="00:32:24.690" style="s2">create our own currency done deal ten</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.400" end="00:32:27.870" style="s2">years ago what the hell are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.690" end="00:32:29.730" style="s2">about now obviously right yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.870" end="00:32:30.990" style="s2">the exact right design not quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.730" end="00:32:32.670" style="s2">yet we&#39;ve got a bunch of good people</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.990" end="00:32:35.310" style="s2">who&#39;ve been building a lot of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.670" end="00:32:38.670" style="s2">making good headway close ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.310" end="00:32:40.290" style="s2">again no idea now kind of close so just</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.670" end="00:32:43.380" style="s2">got a little bit just got to close that</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.290" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">last little bit yeah no it&#39;s huge I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.380" end="00:32:47.010" style="s2">there&#39;s so much potential happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:48.390" style="s2">right now because I mean I had this</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.010" end="00:32:50.220" style="s2">concept that isn&#39;t any of the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.390" end="00:32:51.900" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing is a project necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.220" end="00:32:53.640" style="s2">but it might be in the future which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.900" end="00:32:55.140" style="s2">like there&#39;s these four questions that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.640" end="00:32:58.050" style="s2">I&#39;m like if we solve them and you never</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.140" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">solve them but its life is about trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.050" end="00:33:02.300" style="s2">to solve them and never solving them and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:04.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like Who am I who are my people</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.300" end="00:33:08.430" style="s2">what is my purpose and what do I need</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.770" end="00:33:10.200" style="s2">and at every level we solve that you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.430" end="00:33:12.180" style="s2">something intrinsically valuable when</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.200" end="00:33:14.190" style="s2">you know yourself a little bit that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.180" end="00:33:15.990" style="s2">gift when you have one friend gets you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.190" end="00:33:17.850" style="s2">for you that&#39;s a gift when you figure</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.990" end="00:33:18.710" style="s2">out what you&#39;re supposed to do today for</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.850" end="00:33:21.710" style="s2">five</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.710" end="00:33:23.330" style="s2">and so of course I want to create the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.710" end="00:33:25.790" style="s2">technology that facilitates that whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.330" end="00:33:27.230" style="s2">process but even just a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.790" end="00:33:29.450" style="s2">weekly write with five different people</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.230" end="00:33:30.650" style="s2">where you&#39;re concentrating on Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.450" end="00:33:32.180" style="s2">or you&#39;re concentrate on creating a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.650" end="00:33:34.370" style="s2">culture that people can show up in as</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.180" end="00:33:35.990" style="s2">themselves you&#39;re concentrating on like</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.370" end="00:33:37.820" style="s2">I might not want to sit at a table with</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.990" end="00:33:39.590" style="s2">you but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.820" end="00:33:41.480" style="s2">to sit at anyone&#39;s table right like</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.590" end="00:33:44.090" style="s2">everyone&#39;s deserving of people even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.480" end="00:33:45.950" style="s2">I&#39;m not your people everyone has a place</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.090" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">you&#39;re worthy because you&#39;re a human</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.650" end="00:34:01.550" style="s2">much better value than whatever those</p>

<p begin="00:36:01.880" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">becoming aware of the fact that there</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.080" end="00:36:07.190" style="s2">are medical doctors and nurses right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.700" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">who are being fired for doing the right</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.190" end="00:36:10.730" style="s2">thing right for complaining about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:13.100" style="s2">fact there&#39;s not adequate PPE to protect</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.730" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">themselves and he&#39;s like this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.100" end="00:36:17.030" style="s2">done like the this corrupt system will</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:20.740" style="s2">be burned to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.030" end="00:36:23.990" style="s2">once this crisis is over hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.740" end="00:36:25.580" style="s2">that&#39;s it and he sees seeing the right</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">thing and there&#39;s an energy behind it of</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.580" end="00:36:31.100" style="s2">a recognition that the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:33.170" style="s2">here he say look I&#39;m a doctor I have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.100" end="00:36:34.460" style="s2">purpose I don&#39;t think anybody has any</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.170" end="00:36:35.960" style="s2">questions about whether my purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.460" end="00:36:40.250" style="s2">valuable and I&#39;m here to do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.960" end="00:36:41.660" style="s2">yeah and everybody else has a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.250" end="00:36:42.950" style="s2">and those purposes are valuable though</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.660" end="00:36:44.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not obvious exactly what they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.950" end="00:36:46.100" style="s2">in some cases but that&#39;s it&#39;s as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.930" end="00:36:47.630" style="s2">as simple as that just find the people</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.100" end="00:36:48.950" style="s2">we&#39;ll help them find their purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.630" end="00:36:50.270" style="s2">support them and doing their purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.950" end="00:36:53.810" style="s2">then connect with other people who get</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.270" end="00:36:56.780" style="s2">it they&#39;re supposed to support them any</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.810" end="00:37:00.920" style="s2">it ain&#39;t how I says it&#39;s simple and easy</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.780" end="00:37:03.500" style="s2">but it&#39;s simple yes absolutely and it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.920" end="00:37:05.660" style="s2">all viable all doable and I love that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.500" end="00:37:08.810" style="s2">like this isn&#39;t going back to normal but</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.660" end="00:37:10.700" style="s2">this is also a boat as mild and easy an</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.810" end="00:37:12.770" style="s2">apocalypse as I can imagine like people</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.700" end="00:37:14.750" style="s2">are stuck at home we&#39;ll figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.770" end="00:37:16.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s like people have time and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.750" end="00:37:18.530" style="s2">have this it&#39;s like mother nature did</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.760" end="00:37:20.860" style="s2">send us all in our room without I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.530" end="00:37:23.300" style="s2">I could if mother nature&#39;s intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.860" end="00:37:25.100" style="s2">this is about the most perfect</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.300" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">intelligent thing to do to our species</p>
