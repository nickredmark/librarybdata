<p begin="00:00:04.589" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">nice thank you so and so much for making</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.899" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">time for this session I&#39;m really looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">forward to it and me too</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:18.300" style="s2">good to be with you what what I like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">rather than me going into a long reading</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.300" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">of a bio I actually like to start with</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">inviting people to really take the time</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">to tell a little bit their own story</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:32.940" style="s2">like what is your point where things</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:34.770" style="s2">started to shift I mean I know some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.940" end="00:00:39.680" style="s2">your story which is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.770" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">pertinent and how did you grow into this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.680" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">realization that as life we can create</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">conditions conducive to life and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">regeneration is really our job if we if</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:57.050" style="s2">we want to reconnect to the wider family</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">that were part of and that we depend on</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.050" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">so over to you John well sure and again</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">thanks for the opportunity to to share</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:10.890" style="s2">this I you know the the the short</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">version is I spent nearly 20 years at</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.890" end="00:01:17.060" style="s2">what I always like to call the old JP</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">Morgan and you know I was completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.060" end="00:01:22.259" style="s2">ignorant of any of these issues like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">think most people even today who work in</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.259" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">big finance even with the rise of all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:31.259" style="s2">the ESG and sustainability conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">that the the understanding of this issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.259" end="00:01:37.049" style="s2">particularly a regenerative system is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">still missing from from from Wall Street</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.049" end="00:01:41.939" style="s2">by and large but I you know I worked in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">a different time in Morgan it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.939" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">different culture it was a very positive</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">experience for the most part and I kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">of left in 2001 really in response to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">nagging itch that I had that had started</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">many years earlier and the merger with</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">Chase kind of gave me the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">leave and and not leave you know my</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">stock options vested so it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">easy time to to walk out the door and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">I chose to do that just on an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.640" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:19.060" style="s2">but that I needed to find a different</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:20.650" style="s2">purpose in my life and things started to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:22.629" style="s2">happen very quickly after that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.650" end="00:02:26.769" style="s2">probably the highlight or the low-light</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.629" end="00:02:28.959" style="s2">but the most impactful was that I the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.769" end="00:02:31.569" style="s2">first day I went back to the city after</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.959" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">taking the summer off to start to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.569" end="00:02:39.459" style="s2">so what&#39;s next part of my life happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:41.439" style="s2">to be 9/11 and so I experienced that I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.459" end="00:02:44.620" style="s2">had a meeting with a charter school CEO</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.439" end="00:02:46.390" style="s2">downtown at 9:30 in the morning and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.620" end="00:02:47.980" style="s2">was thinking about I was doing impact</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.390" end="00:02:49.150" style="s2">investing already and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.980" end="00:02:52.269" style="s2">about it getting involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.150" end="00:02:54.129" style="s2">education challenge and with a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.269" end="00:02:58.180" style="s2">at 9:30 that means I was in the subway</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.129" end="00:02:59.950" style="s2">at 9:10 and so I got to the street in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.180" end="00:03:03.670" style="s2">lower Manhattan right at the moment when</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.950" end="00:03:06.909" style="s2">the second plane hit and so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.670" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">forced me into this kind of deep think</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.909" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">period and so did to answer your</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:15.579" style="s2">question I spent the next several years</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:17.849" style="s2">you know dabbling in various</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.579" end="00:03:20.889" style="s2">entrepreneurial projects but mostly</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.849" end="00:03:23.019" style="s2">sitting in this building which is in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.889" end="00:03:26.440" style="s2">converted barn which I set up as a home</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.019" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">office reading books and I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.440" end="00:03:31.269" style="s2">academic by background and I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">started reading stuff somewhat randomly</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.269" end="00:03:38.079" style="s2">and I was sort of a self-select</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:40.090" style="s2">self-taught PhD and truth and discovered</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.079" end="00:03:41.980" style="s2">the environmental crisis read limits to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.090" end="00:03:48.970" style="s2">growth read the food shops work on</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.980" end="00:03:52.049" style="s2">systems and it was mind-blowing because</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.970" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">I I kind of came to this rolling</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.049" end="00:03:58.329" style="s2">understanding that everything I thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:03:59.980" style="s2">was true was not possible physically the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.329" end="00:04:02.919" style="s2">physics of exponential growth on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.980" end="00:04:06.129" style="s2">finite planet don&#39;t work and as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.919" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">finance guy I know that the economy is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.129" end="00:04:10.900" style="s2">driven by finance and if the economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:13.329" style="s2">premise of our entire global economy is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.900" end="00:04:16.570" style="s2">in conflict with the laws of physics we</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.329" end="00:04:18.760" style="s2">have a serious problem and so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.570" end="00:04:22.210" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially how you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.760" end="00:04:25.150" style="s2">just this search for a not an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.210" end="00:04:25.889" style="s2">that question but a pathway to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.150" end="00:04:30.090" style="s2">our way</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.889" end="00:04:32.249" style="s2">from that conclusion that brought me on</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.090" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">to this path of living systems and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.249" end="00:04:39.389" style="s2">ultimately the regenerative paradigm so</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:43.139" style="s2">so in terms of the sequence leaving your</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.389" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">old job was were you already sensing</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.139" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">that there was something amiss with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:52.439" style="s2">system or where you&#39;d only once you took</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:55.080" style="s2">the time out and you could step back and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.439" end="00:04:59.189" style="s2">had the time to read and growing into</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.080" end="00:05:01.529" style="s2">the inside so I was I knew there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.189" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">something wrong with the system from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.529" end="00:05:07.050" style="s2">you know personal fit point of view I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">you know I frankly got tired of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.050" end="00:05:10.439" style="s2">I went it believe it or not I went into</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:14.729" style="s2">Wall Street with a fairly idealistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.439" end="00:05:18.330" style="s2">view that that finance was the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.729" end="00:05:19.740" style="s2">engine of economic prosperity and so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.330" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">was going to learn about finance and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.740" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">then you know I had this idea maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:25.830" style="s2">work for the World Bank some day and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:28.259" style="s2">save the world and and I kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.830" end="00:05:31.639" style="s2">into derivatives at the beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.259" end="00:05:34.469" style="s2">suddenly the purpose of my career was</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.639" end="00:05:36.389" style="s2">career success and making money as</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.469" end="00:05:38.909" style="s2">opposed to doing something productive in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.389" end="00:05:41.399" style="s2">the world and so I got tired of that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.909" end="00:05:44.909" style="s2">realized that I kind of I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.399" end="00:05:46.349" style="s2">remember one morning literally looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.909" end="00:05:48.899" style="s2">in the mirror as I was getting dressed</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.349" end="00:05:52.379" style="s2">and not liking the person I was becoming</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.899" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">and I I remember one day you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.379" end="00:05:57.419" style="s2">managing global capital markets</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:58.949" style="s2">businesses and the big event every year</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.419" end="00:06:00.750" style="s2">is when you get your bonus and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.949" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">remember handing this trader his bonus</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.750" end="00:06:06.629" style="s2">and it was a big number and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:08.699" style="s2">it was you know it wouldn&#39;t sound like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.629" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">big number today given how much people</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.699" end="00:06:13.189" style="s2">are making but it was a lot of money and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:16.589" style="s2">the guy looked at me and he said</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.189" end="00:06:17.819" style="s2">something to the effect of you know well</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.589" end="00:06:20.159" style="s2">something I wouldn&#39;t say on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.819" end="00:06:23.310" style="s2">recording I may be only where I could go</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.159" end="00:06:26.039" style="s2">and I just said you know my life is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.310" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">about dealing with little shithead</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.039" end="00:06:30.330" style="s2">traders who you know tell me where to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:32.899" style="s2">when I hand them a big check at the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.330" end="00:06:35.190" style="s2">of the year and so I just I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.899" end="00:06:38.610" style="s2">recoiled against the kind of money</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.190" end="00:06:39.430" style="s2">culture that Wall Street had become but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.610" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.430" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">different than understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:45.310" style="s2">economics and finance are in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:49.630" style="s2">with physics that&#39;s a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.310" end="00:06:54.460" style="s2">level of realization so it was more a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.630" end="00:06:56.590" style="s2">personal you know sort of crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.460" end="00:07:02.170" style="s2">consciousness in my own self I would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.590" end="00:07:03.700" style="s2">and what let you and to like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.170" end="00:07:06.030" style="s2">the sequence will said to start up the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.700" end="00:07:08.440" style="s2">capital Institute and then start work on</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.030" end="00:07:11.170" style="s2">what was initially the white paper and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.440" end="00:07:13.390" style="s2">then became ya know it was so I left I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.170" end="00:07:18.210" style="s2">left Wall Street in 2001 I always like</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.390" end="00:07:21.340" style="s2">to say that because I wasn&#39;t there when</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.210" end="00:07:25.600" style="s2">the financials and and and it was a it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.340" end="00:07:27.370" style="s2">was years of you know doing impact</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.600" end="00:07:29.770" style="s2">investing but kind of wandering in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.370" end="00:07:32.980" style="s2">in a dark really it was a search it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.770" end="00:07:35.610" style="s2">my I guess it was sort of my quasi dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.980" end="00:07:38.530" style="s2">night of the soul where I was really</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.610" end="00:07:40.390" style="s2">questioning who I was and what my</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.530" end="00:07:42.910" style="s2">purpose was and then the financial</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.390" end="00:07:45.010" style="s2">crisis happened and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.910" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">my friends who I&#39;ve been sharing this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.010" end="00:07:48.430" style="s2">with suddenly didn&#39;t think I was crazy</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.740" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.430" end="00:07:54.580" style="s2">and so I actually created the capital</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.740" end="00:07:57.330" style="s2">Institute in 2000 you know I formally in</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.580" end="00:08:00.700" style="s2">2010 but I was working on it in 2009 and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.330" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">launched it in 2010 really as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.700" end="00:08:09.400" style="s2">place to ask these questions and and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:14.320" style="s2">had by then discovered Herman Daly and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.400" end="00:08:17.950" style="s2">ecological economics and was wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.320" end="00:08:20.340" style="s2">with this growth issue but but only</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.950" end="00:08:24.100" style="s2">through some of my investment projects</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.340" end="00:08:26.770" style="s2">did I just in agriculture did I discover</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.100" end="00:08:29.100" style="s2">the whole regenerative basically that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.770" end="00:08:32.980" style="s2">the first piece was discovering holism</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.100" end="00:08:35.590" style="s2">in and and I learned that through Allan</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.980" end="00:08:37.840" style="s2">savory and and his holistic land</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.590" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">management and we actually created a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.840" end="00:08:42.040" style="s2">company together called grasslands and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:45.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve been on the savory board for 10</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.040" end="00:08:47.080" style="s2">years and so I&#39;ve learned I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.580" end="00:08:48.760" style="s2">about this distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.080" end="00:08:50.950" style="s2">reductionist thinking and holistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.760" end="00:08:52.810" style="s2">thinking from you know one of the true</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.950" end="00:08:56.450" style="s2">practitioners of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.810" end="00:08:59.170" style="s2">in the world today and Alan introduced</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.450" end="00:09:02.420" style="s2">me to yon Smuts who is essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.170" end="00:09:04.940" style="s2">theoretical master of this and it blows</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.420" end="00:09:07.970" style="s2">my mind that Smuts his work is still not</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.940" end="00:09:09.890" style="s2">it&#39;s barely even recognized by folks</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.970" end="00:09:12.020" style="s2">means months months was such a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.890" end="00:09:17.060" style="s2">fascinating character I mean maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.020" end="00:09:20.630" style="s2">all of it into today&#39;s standards kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.060" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">accolades but he is am the only person</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.630" end="00:09:27.350" style="s2">who signed the armistice of both the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:30.890" style="s2">first and the second world war and many</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.350" end="00:09:33.170" style="s2">know he wrote he wrote was holism and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.890" end="00:09:36.110" style="s2">evolution he kind of wrote maybe in six</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.170" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">months between wars when it wasn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.110" end="00:09:38.870" style="s2">know and he apologized in the foreword</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:41.270" style="s2">for saying you know I didn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.870" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">enough time to work on this but here you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.270" end="00:09:48.590" style="s2">go and and it&#39;s extraordinary and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:50.900" style="s2">came out in 1959 leave and the little</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.590" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">later at the the work that Patrick</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.900" end="00:09:55.160" style="s2">Geddes did afterwards was very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:59.420" style="s2">influenced by my smarts and and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.160" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">so much of NATO work yeah he&#39;s not fully</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.420" end="00:10:06.410" style="s2">recognized yet so support Patrick Geddes</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:10.180" style="s2">was the founding father of bio</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.410" end="00:10:14.150" style="s2">regionalism he yeah you know every day</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:19.310" style="s2">he lived in Scotland and around the turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.150" end="00:10:22.550" style="s2">of the century and as a biologist we</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.310" end="00:10:25.310" style="s2">also recognized as founder of town</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.550" end="00:10:28.670" style="s2">planning and sociology and the Admiral</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.310" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">the Edinburgh Festival is something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.670" end="00:10:34.340" style="s2">grew out of the N Buress summer school</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:37.160" style="s2">where heckle Geddes brought people</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.340" end="00:10:41.470" style="s2">likely play and heckle and Kropotkin and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.160" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">all these thinkers together to explore</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.470" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">basically inspired by by unsmooth</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:49.280" style="s2">specific explore more holistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:49.610" style="s2">perspective on our participation in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.280" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.610" end="00:10:54.770" style="s2">yeah cementing character and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s worth sort of drilling down on this</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.770" end="00:10:59.870" style="s2">point for a second I I remember when</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:02.660" style="s2">Allen&#39;s first unsavoury first started</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.870" end="00:11:04.850" style="s2">telling me you know I said so he&#39;s known</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.660" end="00:11:06.259" style="s2">for being this guy who says cows are</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.850" end="00:11:07.100" style="s2">gonna save the planet</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.259" end="00:11:09.259" style="s2">and that&#39;s obviously a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.100" end="00:11:10.970" style="s2">controversial thing to say and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.259" end="00:11:12.319" style="s2">think he probably could have said it</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.970" end="00:11:16.009" style="s2">better and I think he was misinterpreted</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.319" end="00:11:19.009" style="s2">by what he actually meant but but in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.009" end="00:11:21.049" style="s2">getting to know him deeply remember I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.009" end="00:11:23.989" style="s2">was on a walk with him once and he said</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.049" end="00:11:28.039" style="s2">you know my real contribution to society</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.989" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">is holistic decision-making and has</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.039" end="00:11:33.679" style="s2">nothing to do with cows and nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:35.449" style="s2">do with ranches and and I remember it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.679" end="00:11:37.999" style="s2">was sort of early in my relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.449" end="00:11:39.679" style="s2">with him and so I of course those words</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.999" end="00:11:41.389" style="s2">are pretty abstract and so I remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.679" end="00:11:42.769" style="s2">thinking about yeah yeah whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.389" end="00:11:45.259" style="s2">just tell me about this cow thing how</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.769" end="00:11:48.259" style="s2">does that work and I I think we are in</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.259" end="00:11:50.269" style="s2">the same place in economics and finance</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.259" end="00:11:52.069" style="s2">and everything else I mean this is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.269" end="00:11:55.549" style="s2">this issue applies to kind of every</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.069" end="00:11:58.009" style="s2">field of knowledge and and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.549" end="00:12:01.249" style="s2">something that we naturally don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.009" end="00:12:04.429" style="s2">to tackle because it&#39;s abstract and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.249" end="00:12:06.529" style="s2">so if you think about holism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.429" end="00:12:09.019" style="s2">reductionism in finance I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.529" end="00:12:13.160" style="s2">nothing more reductionist and finance we</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.019" end="00:12:17.179" style="s2">by design optimize risk adjust return on</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:20.239" style="s2">capital and and and use terms like</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.179" end="00:12:24.139" style="s2">internal rate of return which means</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.239" end="00:12:26.299" style="s2">internal to that project and external to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.139" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">the whole system or in ignoring the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.299" end="00:12:32.839" style="s2">whole system so the things we are taught</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:35.059" style="s2">and believed are our self-evident truths</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.839" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">are actually in conflict with a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.059" end="00:12:40.699" style="s2">worldview and so it&#39;s pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:43.759" style="s2">change someone&#39;s belief system once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.699" end="00:12:45.919" style="s2">like wired in in in that sense and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.759" end="00:12:47.779" style="s2">all of the conversations were having</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.919" end="00:12:50.899" style="s2">about shifting the economy is shifting</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.779" end="00:12:54.379" style="s2">finance always then kind of fall back</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.899" end="00:12:55.999" style="s2">into that reductionist logic and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.379" end="00:12:58.249" style="s2">wonder why we&#39;re just making incremental</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.999" end="00:13:01.549" style="s2">change and not transformational change</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.249" end="00:13:03.289" style="s2">yes now I&#39;m the guy like Alan was to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.549" end="00:13:05.749" style="s2">who says yeah but we have to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.289" end="00:13:12.019" style="s2">holism and reductionism and everyone go</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.749" end="00:13:14.749" style="s2">away no I I mean I&#39;ve sort of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.019" end="00:13:17.029" style="s2">completely aligned with you because I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.749" end="00:13:18.289" style="s2">have been countered brainwashed at Omaha</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.029" end="00:13:19.310" style="s2">College in the master&#39;s in holistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.289" end="00:13:23.240" style="s2">science into</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.310" end="00:13:25.940" style="s2">in 2002 with with a with the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.240" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">antidote to something that runs thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.940" end="00:13:32.060" style="s2">deeply through our society that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:36.710" style="s2">even notice how often we are thrown back</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.060" end="00:13:38.750" style="s2">into reductionist frames and which we</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.710" end="00:13:41.270" style="s2">need we just need to know when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.750" end="00:13:43.160" style="s2">using them exactly that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.270" end="00:13:44.839" style="s2">important point because that was one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.160" end="00:13:46.730" style="s2">the things that I started to even kick</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.839" end="00:13:50.060" style="s2">back against at Schumacher at the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.730" end="00:13:53.540" style="s2">because one of the traps we often in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.060" end="00:13:55.190" style="s2">when we try to speak between like about</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.540" end="00:13:58.130" style="s2">the value of reductionism and holism</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.190" end="00:14:00.410" style="s2">next to each other and is to do the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.130" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">whole whole pendulum swing paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.410" end="00:14:05.480" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:08.390" style="s2">m-man we&#39;re old bad new good and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.480" end="00:14:10.190" style="s2">rather than get the integration but but</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.390" end="00:14:11.960" style="s2">I think that that needs to be excused</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.190" end="00:14:13.520" style="s2">impartial partially by it by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.960" end="00:14:16.300" style="s2">structure of language because even</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.520" end="00:14:18.529" style="s2">language has a somewhat either/or</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.300" end="00:14:20.120" style="s2">reductionist framing in it at least in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.529" end="00:14:22.310" style="s2">our Western language in a Western</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.120" end="00:14:25.250" style="s2">language yeah yeah I mean what West</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.310" end="00:14:29.030" style="s2">Jackson has a great saying West Was what</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.030" end="00:14:33.260" style="s2">says there&#39;s nothing wrong with the</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.790" end="00:15:09.560" style="s2">process of building the structures like</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.709" end="00:15:12.530" style="s2">on the one hand yes we need to value</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.560" end="00:15:15.230" style="s2">things beyond financial capital but then</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.530" end="00:15:19.730" style="s2">I I often find that the framings around</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.230" end="00:15:22.250" style="s2">an ecological capital social capital or</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.730" end="00:15:25.400" style="s2">living capital whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.250" end="00:15:28.070" style="s2">it could be so quickly the minute you</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.400" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">create a tool where you can convert one</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.170" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">to say we need to go beyond just valuing</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:48.540" style="s2">investment we need to talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.170" end="00:15:50.220" style="s2">other things and value them the only way</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.540" end="00:15:54.540" style="s2">that we seem to be able to value them is</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.220" end="00:15:56.550" style="s2">to bring them where every dollar and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.540" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">truly believe that many of the people</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.350" end="00:16:24.870" style="s2">challenge that I&#39;ve only recently come</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.620" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">to appreciate and that is you know this</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.870" end="00:16:31.050" style="s2">is a very practical issue but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:35.280" style="s2">very I think significant barrier to real</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.050" end="00:16:37.700" style="s2">progress and that is that if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.280" end="00:16:40.520" style="s2">don&#39;t operate in the current paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.700" end="00:16:44.730" style="s2">which I would argue you know converting</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.520" end="00:16:47.880" style="s2">natural capital into a monetizable of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.730" end="00:16:50.910" style="s2">measurable thing means you can work in</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.880" end="00:16:53.280" style="s2">the current paradigm mm-hmm and so if</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.910" end="00:16:56.130" style="s2">you happen to like having a job and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.280" end="00:16:58.050" style="s2">making a living you&#39;re sort of forced to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.130" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">do that even if it&#39;s subconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.050" end="00:17:02.070" style="s2">because you can then get invited to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:03.510" style="s2">parties you can get invited to give</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.070" end="00:17:06.750" style="s2">talks you can invite it to be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.510" end="00:17:08.670" style="s2">professor you can invite it to work in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.750" end="00:17:12.050" style="s2">company and work on measuring you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.670" end="00:17:18.150" style="s2">your ESG stuff but if you reject that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.050" end="00:17:21.150" style="s2">you know it&#39;s hard to find a job and yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.150" end="00:17:22.860" style="s2">we have to just create them yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.150" end="00:17:25.380" style="s2">that&#39;s easier said than done and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.860" end="00:17:27.060" style="s2">easier said than done it&#39;s easier for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.380" end="00:17:29.070" style="s2">guy like me to say that who spent 20</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.060" end="00:17:30.330" style="s2">years on Wall Street then you know my</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.070" end="00:17:33.000" style="s2">kids so we&#39;re trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.330" end="00:17:35.640" style="s2">to build a career and so I think it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.190" end="00:17:41.940" style="s2">if it&#39;s at a subconscious level and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.050" end="00:17:46.460" style="s2">people naturally are going to gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.940" end="00:17:46.460" style="s2">toward what ultimately is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.470" end="00:17:54.120" style="s2">a very sort of subversive hold that the</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.120" end="00:18:00.330" style="s2">thinking I mean and the economy I see</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.530" end="00:18:04.230" style="s2">this every time when we try to create</p>

<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:50.460" style="s2">might be able to invest some extra time</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.460" end="00:18:56.250" style="s2">into the bigger story but if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.460" end="00:18:57.659" style="s2">kind of with the waterline just you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.250" end="00:19:00.059" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.659" end="00:19:02.570" style="s2">on I&#39;m taking time out to look at the</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.570" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">organizations and and the big thing is</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:12.809" style="s2">organizations but bringing them up to</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.809" end="00:19:19.530" style="s2">can can really have a transformative</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.530" end="00:19:25.890" style="s2">mean you and I&#39;ve had this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.330" end="00:19:28.740" style="s2">before but I mean the the again getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.890" end="00:19:30.990" style="s2">back to sort of the the powerful to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.740" end="00:19:32.520" style="s2">powerful role financed plays in this if</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.990" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the nonprofit</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:41.429" style="s2">you know the fuel there is is is funding</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.570" end="00:19:43.230" style="s2">from foundations and you know I was in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.429" end="00:19:45.650" style="s2">meeting last summer I probably shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.230" end="00:19:50.700" style="s2">put any names out but I was in a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.650" end="00:19:54.440" style="s2">convened by a philanthropy adviser among</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.700" end="00:19:57.960" style="s2">a number of you know large brand name</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.440" end="00:20:00.090" style="s2">foundations and and I was there as sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.960" end="00:20:02.760" style="s2">of the you know everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.090" end="00:20:06.120" style="s2">I was invited was a foundation and I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.760" end="00:20:07.770" style="s2">there as kind of a provocateur who is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.120" end="00:20:12.179" style="s2">systems thinker and the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.770" end="00:20:15.090" style="s2">meeting was to help foundations begin to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.179" end="00:20:17.429" style="s2">think and behave and operate in a more</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.090" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">systemic way and there&#39;s a desire within</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.429" end="00:20:22.260" style="s2">the foundation world to do more systemic</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">work easier said than done</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.260" end="00:20:28.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s quite it was quite eye-opening</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:33.659" style="s2">and honestly a bit depressing to realize</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.440" end="00:20:35.340" style="s2">how stuck the foundation model is in you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.659" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">know reductionist problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.340" end="00:20:39.179" style="s2">show me your problem show me your theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:41.460" style="s2">of change show me what you&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.179" end="00:20:44.279" style="s2">and then show to me in three years that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.460" end="00:20:46.279" style="s2">you fix the problem and and and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.279" end="00:20:48.539" style="s2">completely different paradigm than</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.279" end="00:20:52.830" style="s2">transform transforming systems as you</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.539" end="00:20:54.630" style="s2">know I can that&#39;s where the fuel goes in</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.830" end="00:20:57.230" style="s2">the nonprofit world so surprise surprise</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.630" end="00:21:00.059" style="s2">that&#39;s what nonprofits primarily are</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.230" end="00:21:02.370" style="s2">resigned to doing in order to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.059" end="00:21:05.640" style="s2">fuel I had a very similar experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.370" end="00:21:08.039" style="s2">also last October where again maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.640" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">naming where but I wasn&#39;t I was in</p>

<p begin="00:23:26.379" end="00:23:33.989" style="s2">principles is is the only pathway that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.820" end="00:23:38.440" style="s2">know of to not make those mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.989" end="00:23:40.509" style="s2">because if you if you can if you can if</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.440" end="00:23:43.749" style="s2">you can get clear on the principles of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.509" end="00:23:44.950" style="s2">healthy system mmm no they&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.749" end="00:23:47.559" style="s2">know they&#39;re not nice to have so there</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.950" end="00:23:48.879" style="s2">are actually principles that if you if</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.559" end="00:23:51.519" style="s2">you&#39;re not in alignment with them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.879" end="00:23:54.039" style="s2">not healthy then you have a road map and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.519" end="00:23:56.619" style="s2">without that you have your opinion in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.039" end="00:23:59.559" style="s2">opinion in jobless opinion man you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.619" end="00:24:03.340" style="s2">false exam you know false projects that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.559" end="00:24:04.600" style="s2">may show a great project progress in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.340" end="00:24:07.779" style="s2">you know in a time frame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.600" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">irrelevant like three to ten years but</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.779" end="00:24:13.029" style="s2">ultimately be the source of future</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.159" style="s2">problems that are exponentially worse</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.029" end="00:24:18.580" style="s2">and if you need an example of that look</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.159" end="00:24:20.710" style="s2">at the Green Revolution yeah right I</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.580" end="00:24:24.249" style="s2">mean it was a brilliant solution to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.710" end="00:24:26.200" style="s2">problem and it lasted decades and now we</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.249" end="00:24:29.410" style="s2">come and we realize</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.200" end="00:24:31.330" style="s2">how profoundly misguided it was hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.410" end="00:24:33.640" style="s2">you think about the probably billions of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.330" end="00:24:35.170" style="s2">dollars of foundation money that went</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.640" end="00:24:38.590" style="s2">into the Green Revolution and are still</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.170" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">going into the Green Revolution I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.590" end="00:24:42.970" style="s2">so sure if it ever was really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:46.060" style="s2">because we&#39;ve we&#39;ve never actually got</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.970" end="00:24:48.820" style="s2">to a point where like it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.060" end="00:24:52.870" style="s2">more than half of the world&#39;s people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.820" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">being fed by small-scale peasant farmers</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.870" end="00:24:58.000" style="s2">most of them are women and and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:24:59.710" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s a big oversell of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.000" end="00:25:01.210" style="s2">what the big agro industry actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.710" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">managed in terms of feeding the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.210" end="00:25:11.800" style="s2">and I I think yeah but but but in in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:13.870" style="s2">you know you ask the man on the street</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.800" end="00:25:15.610" style="s2">or the informed man on the street or</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.870" end="00:25:17.470" style="s2">woman on the street about the Green</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.610" end="00:25:20.260" style="s2">Revolution and most people say yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.470" end="00:25:20.530" style="s2">saved billions of people from starving</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.260" end="00:25:22.450" style="s2">to death</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.530" end="00:25:25.240" style="s2">mm-hmm and there&#39;s some truth to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.450" end="00:25:29.110" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.240" end="00:25:30.550" style="s2">you know anyway but I would love to come</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.110" end="00:25:33.130" style="s2">back to the first two things actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.550" end="00:25:34.360" style="s2">because I&#39;m just imagining you sitting</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.130" end="00:25:35.920" style="s2">in the room that you&#39;re sitting right</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.360" end="00:25:39.580" style="s2">now reading all these books and doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.920" end="00:25:42.700" style="s2">your deep deep dive and I I must say you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.580" end="00:25:47.320" style="s2">did an excellent job because I had a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.700" end="00:25:50.740" style="s2">moment before I knew you and when I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.320" end="00:25:55.180" style="s2">probably reading through the pre-final</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.740" end="00:25:56.770" style="s2">first draft of my of my book and I did</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.180" end="00:25:58.870" style="s2">another search and suddenly there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.770" end="00:26:03.310" style="s2">this white paper that pops up from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.870" end="00:26:10.270" style="s2">Capitol Institute and it&#39;s invited well</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.310" end="00:26:12.460" style="s2">I I know how to search and and I started</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.270" end="00:26:14.380" style="s2">reading it and I had this brief moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.460" end="00:26:14.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of internal locus of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.380" end="00:26:19.090" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.890" end="00:26:20.980" style="s2">and a story of initially having that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.090" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">can&#39;t believe that somebody&#39;s put out</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.980" end="00:26:25.660" style="s2">something where they&#39;ve mapped out what</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:28.540" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to map with my book but they</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.660" end="00:26:29.830" style="s2">got it out before me and then I thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.540" end="00:26:33.250" style="s2">wow wonderful I&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.830" end="00:26:35.710" style="s2">corroborated in the maps worth mapping</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.250" end="00:26:37.630" style="s2">yeah by somebody else and somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.710" end="00:26:38.809" style="s2">has found the same pieces on and then I</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.630" end="00:26:43.009" style="s2">realized that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.809" end="00:26:45.529" style="s2">and I had some extra and and and since</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.009" end="00:26:49.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve met like very quickly I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.529" end="00:26:55.190" style="s2">was literally I caught myself in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.399" end="00:26:56.600" style="s2">initial and then it arranged eggs and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.190" end="00:27:00.860" style="s2">then I was like wait a minute what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.600" end="00:27:03.799" style="s2">this competitive yeah yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.860" end="00:27:06.620" style="s2">immediately kind of applied mudita and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.799" end="00:27:09.499" style="s2">celebrated what what you deceived and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.620" end="00:27:13.570" style="s2">and in in that initial white paper you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.499" end="00:27:16.490" style="s2">were moving your way towards these</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.570" end="00:27:19.580" style="s2">principles that you&#39;ve established for</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.490" end="00:27:21.080" style="s2">regenerative economics and tell me a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.580" end="00:27:24.499" style="s2">little bit more about what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.080" end="00:27:27.499" style="s2">principles I and and and who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.499" end="00:27:30.039" style="s2">gave you the initial impulse to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.499" end="00:27:32.419" style="s2">that&#39;s that must be one of them hmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.039" end="00:27:35.029" style="s2">well first thank you for your your</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.419" end="00:27:36.200" style="s2">compliment coming from you that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.029" end="00:27:38.090" style="s2">know that means something cuz you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.200" end="00:27:41.179" style="s2">obviously thought as deeply about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.090" end="00:27:43.460" style="s2">as anyone and and I would I would just</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.179" end="00:27:46.100" style="s2">throw a little cold water on it by</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.460" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">telling you a quick anecdote so I was at</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.100" end="00:27:50.809" style="s2">a regenerative conference once and I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:53.299" style="s2">I&#39;ve given my spiel about my principles</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.809" end="00:27:55.970" style="s2">and my paper and blah blah blah this</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.299" end="00:27:56.360" style="s2">very thoughtful smart academic guy you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.970" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.360" end="00:28:03.249" style="s2">said it said essentially you know John</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:06.669" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing really new here so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.249" end="00:28:09.559" style="s2">think I think we&#39;re all regurgitating</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.669" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">stuff that probably is all rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.559" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">indigenous wisdom you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:16.970" style="s2">if you really go down to it what what</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:19.970" style="s2">we&#39;re all saying is what the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.970" end="00:28:22.039" style="s2">cultures understood and have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.970" end="00:28:24.980" style="s2">but in an language that it&#39;s hard for us</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.039" end="00:28:27.139" style="s2">to translate into a Western kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.980" end="00:28:29.990" style="s2">understanding but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.139" end="00:28:34.519" style="s2">really I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot new</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.990" end="00:28:36.379" style="s2">in my work I if I if I take pride in it</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.519" end="00:28:39.529" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s a synthesis and an</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.379" end="00:28:41.690" style="s2">integration that is put into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.529" end="00:28:45.019" style="s2">contemporary context for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.690" end="00:28:48.259" style="s2">contemporary challenges we face and I as</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.019" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">I wrote it I I was always thinking of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.259" end="00:28:52.130" style="s2">friend of mine his name is Duncan he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:56.330" style="s2">real person</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.130" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">who is who is a Wall Street guy and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.330" end="00:29:00.710" style="s2">always wanted to write in a way that my</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:03.680" style="s2">friend Duncan wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.710" end="00:29:06.740" style="s2">eliminate or reduce they were ignored</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.680" end="00:29:09.770" style="s2">without going further so it&#39;s a very you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.740" end="00:29:11.750" style="s2">know I try to make it sort of something</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.770" end="00:29:13.190" style="s2">that that the current paradigm can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:29:13.190" end="00:29:20.810" style="s2">and so my language is is such that it it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.760" end="00:29:23.000" style="s2">will be acceptable but I think the and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.810" end="00:29:25.610" style="s2">and that makes it that limits it to some</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.000" end="00:29:27.230" style="s2">to some audiences probably for example</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.610" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">the choice of the word capitalism you</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.230" end="00:29:32.200" style="s2">know what I mean by capitalism is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:35.090" style="s2">some integral or integrated</p>

<p begin="00:29:35.090" end="00:29:39.530" style="s2">capital but I chose the word capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.790" end="00:29:42.620" style="s2">so that my American audience wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.530" end="00:29:44.540" style="s2">dismiss this as some socialist no this</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.620" end="00:29:46.670" style="s2">is the I&#39;m glad you&#39;re saying this</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.540" end="00:29:49.250" style="s2">because I&#39;ve before I heard you say this</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.670" end="00:29:51.770" style="s2">um I&#39;ve actually just justified and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.250" end="00:29:54.560" style="s2">defended you for making that choice to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.770" end="00:29:56.600" style="s2">number of people because I knew a number</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.560" end="00:29:58.250" style="s2">of people who were quite excited about</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.600" end="00:30:00.410" style="s2">the initial white paper that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.250" end="00:30:03.080" style="s2">originally called regenerative economics</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.410" end="00:30:05.540" style="s2">and and and then when it came out as</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.080" end="00:30:08.350" style="s2">regenerative capitalism they almost felt</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.540" end="00:30:11.300" style="s2">betrayed but you hadn&#39;t used that word</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.350" end="00:30:14.300" style="s2">and I I said to all of them but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.300" end="00:30:16.250" style="s2">talking to you he&#39;s trying to preach to</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.250" end="00:30:21.940" style="s2">into a group of people that really need</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.410" end="00:30:24.680" style="s2">to start a conversation around it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.940" end="00:30:25.130" style="s2">just yesterday I was talking to Alan</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.820" end="00:31:17.210" style="s2">my hand over probably how&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.710" end="00:31:18.890" style="s2">know I personally used a word for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.210" end="00:31:22.220" style="s2">reason you just mentioned and partially</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.890" end="00:31:23.900" style="s2">you know if if it was if I were to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.220" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">more accurate I would have called a</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.900" end="00:31:31.010" style="s2">multi capitals ism but that obviously is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:35.570" style="s2">a mouthful</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.010" end="00:31:37.580" style="s2">but but actually that there is a you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.570" end="00:31:41.480" style="s2">know I think regenerative economics that</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.580" end="00:31:45.800" style="s2">is the core that&#39;s home base for me but</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.480" end="00:31:47.630" style="s2">there are attributes of our what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.800" end="00:31:50.420" style="s2">prefer to use the term free enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.630" end="00:31:53.720" style="s2">system that too often get either</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.420" end="00:31:56.420" style="s2">dismissed or not even comprehended by</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.720" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">folks in the let&#39;s call it the do-gooder</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.420" end="00:32:05.870" style="s2">world who&#39;ve never worked in the private</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:09.400" style="s2">sector and some of those are very</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.870" end="00:32:12.350" style="s2">aligned with regeneration so for example</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.400" end="00:32:15.680" style="s2">innovation and an adoption and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.350" end="00:32:20.270" style="s2">adaptation is you know probably at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.680" end="00:32:22.160" style="s2">heart of the capitalist system and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.270" end="00:32:25.610" style="s2">know that that it&#39;s not enough on its</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.160" end="00:32:27.890" style="s2">own but it&#39;s pretty easy to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.610" end="00:32:30.680" style="s2">flush the baby out with the bathwater if</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.890" end="00:32:32.780" style="s2">we&#39;re not careful and so I do try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.680" end="00:32:35.270" style="s2">sort of have this one foot in both camps</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.780" end="00:32:37.490" style="s2">and you know not as many friends in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.270" end="00:32:39.890" style="s2">either camp as I might have if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.490" end="00:32:42.560" style="s2">went one way or the other I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.890" end="00:32:44.780" style="s2">the the yeah I know that then I make</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.560" end="00:32:46.910" style="s2">quite well but I think that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.780" end="00:32:48.890" style="s2">need to put Humpty Dumpty back together</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.910" end="00:32:50.750" style="s2">again we need to build bridges between</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.890" end="00:32:53.270" style="s2">these camps and make people see these</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.750" end="00:32:55.430" style="s2">different arguments and and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.270" end="00:32:58.310" style="s2">before we go back to the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.430" end="00:33:00.020" style="s2">regenerative capitalism and where are</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.310" end="00:33:03.260" style="s2">you at because right now there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.020" end="00:33:05.780" style="s2">conversations around redesigning</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.260" end="00:33:08.780" style="s2">capitalism I mean that even if you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.780" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">the difference like I remember working</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.780" end="00:33:12.179" style="s2">with guy education and writing their</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:14.610" style="s2">online curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.179" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">and particularly on writing the second</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.610" end="00:33:19.529" style="s2">version of the economics online</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:20.850" style="s2">curriculum when when it first came out</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.529" end="00:33:24.119" style="s2">and Jonathan Thorson wrote the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.850" end="00:33:26.279" style="s2">version and we had a critique on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.119" end="00:33:28.230" style="s2">growth economic system the growth</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.279" end="00:33:32.309" style="s2">imperative in the system and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.230" end="00:33:33.960" style="s2">basically suggested that structurally</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.309" end="00:33:35.639" style="s2">you won&#39;t change anything if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.960" end="00:33:37.320" style="s2">structure try its behavior if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.639" end="00:33:39.509" style="s2">change the structure of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.320" end="00:33:41.789" style="s2">system we will continue to exploit each</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.509" end="00:33:45.509" style="s2">other and the planet and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.789" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">need to redesign economics and that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.509" end="00:33:50.789" style="s2">extremely radical in 2008 yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.049" style="s2">not that that&#39;s was the first time when</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.789" end="00:33:54.360" style="s2">it was said people have been saying it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.049" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">for a long much longer than that but now</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.360" end="00:34:01.320" style="s2">you have the founder of the World</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:04.230" style="s2">Economic Forum as early as 2012 teen</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.320" end="00:34:06.899" style="s2">saying the capitalism is broken and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.230" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">needs redesigning and he even get the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.899" end="00:34:12.059" style="s2">IMF or the WTO and like it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">not a taboo topic anymore to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.059" end="00:34:17.399" style="s2">something is fundamentally needing a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:20.040" style="s2">shift but but but then of course you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.399" end="00:34:23.099" style="s2">the camp&#39;s again of some people say we</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.040" end="00:34:26.669" style="s2">can redesign capital as most we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.099" end="00:34:30.119" style="s2">wreck rescue the world capital if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.669" end="00:34:32.700" style="s2">apply it in a more nuanced way another</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.119" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">signal or capitalism is the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.700" end="00:34:38.149" style="s2">you get it get kind of George Mumby or</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:41.399" style="s2">at the moment is on this that this</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.149" end="00:34:43.020" style="s2">extreme sort of no there is no</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.399" end="00:34:45.030" style="s2">conversation about redesigning</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.020" end="00:34:47.780" style="s2">capitalism we need a new system but</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.030" end="00:34:50.099" style="s2">ultimately it could be the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.780" end="00:34:52.470" style="s2">we&#39;re just getting stuck with language</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.099" end="00:34:54.720" style="s2">here again but where you add on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.470" end="00:34:58.170" style="s2">spectrum well I&#39;d say I mean it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:35:01.230" style="s2">talk for the rest of the day on this you</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.170" end="00:35:03.420" style="s2">know I it&#39;s funny I think most people</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.230" end="00:35:06.450" style="s2">would think that I&#39;m like deep in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.420" end="00:35:10.559" style="s2">conversation because I&#39;m out of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.450" end="00:35:13.290" style="s2">world and and and the truth is my phone</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.559" end="00:35:16.829" style="s2">doesn&#39;t ring from the folks that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.290" end="00:35:19.080" style="s2">rethinking capitalism and and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.829" end="00:35:24.119" style="s2">partly</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.080" end="00:35:27.869" style="s2">I&#39;m viewed as way too radical and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.119" end="00:35:31.109" style="s2">probably way too theoretical and I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.869" end="00:35:34.619" style="s2">frustrated by this and I kind of roll my</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.109" end="00:35:36.089" style="s2">eyes when I see all of the grand the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.619" end="00:35:38.609" style="s2">great capitalists now talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.089" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">corporations need a purpose for example</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.609" end="00:35:43.369" style="s2">well what a brilliant idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:45.780" style="s2">you know the the Business Roundtable</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.369" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">last summer came out with this new</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.780" end="00:35:51.240" style="s2">statement you know hey how about if</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:53.640" style="s2">corporations had a purpose and of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.240" end="00:35:56.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the same statement that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.640" end="00:35:59.430" style="s2">Business Roundtable had as its premise</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.040" end="00:36:02.820" style="s2">in 1982 when I started at JPMorgan and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.430" end="00:36:05.790" style="s2">it was only in the I don&#39;t know early</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.820" end="00:36:08.339" style="s2">90s I think that that Milton Friedman</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.790" end="00:36:09.630" style="s2">school sort of took over and they said</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.339" end="00:36:12.839" style="s2">the purpose is to maximize shareholder</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.630" end="00:36:15.320" style="s2">value so we&#39;re now you know in the elite</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.839" end="00:36:18.359" style="s2">establishment of the Business Roundtable</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.320" end="00:36:19.970" style="s2">which is led by Jamie Dimon who runs JP</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.359" end="00:36:23.070" style="s2">Morgan now we&#39;re now back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.970" end="00:36:25.730" style="s2">understanding what was the baseline in</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.070" end="00:36:29.430" style="s2">the early 1980s which probably goes back</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.730" end="00:36:32.280" style="s2">50 years before that and so you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.430" end="00:36:34.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of new energy around ESG</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.280" end="00:36:37.020" style="s2">and impact investing in blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.470" end="00:36:40.740" style="s2">and you know to be honest I rolled my</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.020" end="00:36:43.470" style="s2">eyes at it because you know with all due</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.740" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">respect I mean these folks and most of</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:52.380" style="s2">very competitive they&#39;re very successful</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.690" end="00:36:54.660" style="s2">and because of that in our culture they</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.380" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">have a very big megaphone and so when</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.660" end="00:36:58.619" style="s2">when they get up and say we need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:01.710" style="s2">reinvent capitalism everyone says yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.619" end="00:37:04.589" style="s2">we need to reinvent capitalism but with</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.589" end="00:37:10.260" style="s2">there and read a hundred books to think</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.260" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">have and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.530" end="00:37:18.900" style="s2">well-meaning and good intention but this</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:22.349" style="s2">gets back to this issue of not really</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.900" end="00:37:28.230" style="s2">getting to two to get your head around</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.349" end="00:37:30.359" style="s2">the fundamental profound disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.230" end="00:37:32.940" style="s2">between you know just sort of boils down</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.359" end="00:37:34.560" style="s2">to exponential growth on a finite planet</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.940" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">and and you know how many people that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.560" end="00:37:37.890" style="s2">work in business in finance actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:40.020" style="s2">understand what the second law of</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.359" end="00:37:50.339" style="s2">bet you if you put a hundred CEOs in a</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.010" end="00:38:10.380" style="s2">and ninety-five percent of them wouldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.329" end="00:38:23.609" style="s2">where we&#39;re sort of moving deckchairs</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.890" end="00:38:26.220" style="s2">around and so I you know I wish that my</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.609" end="00:38:29.640" style="s2">voice was in that conversation I&#39;d be</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.640" end="00:38:35.550" style="s2">that conversation about the future of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.130" end="00:38:38.040" style="s2">capitalism is pretty locked in you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.550" end="00:38:39.810" style="s2">at bat at best its we need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.040" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">internalize externalities which is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.810" end="00:38:44.069" style="s2">reductionist way of putting the problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:45.930" style="s2">in the old paradigm and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.069" end="00:38:48.300" style="s2">progress so that&#39;s good and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.930" end="00:38:51.660" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a massive step and and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.300" end="00:38:53.700" style="s2">it&#39;ll buy us some time but that design</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.660" end="00:38:56.910" style="s2">won&#39;t be the final design and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.700" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">simply not the you know my interest is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.910" end="00:39:02.099" style="s2">sort of Who I am i but the metaphor that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:05.250" style="s2">I use for people is that I&#39;m for</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.099" end="00:39:07.710" style="s2">whatever reason called and I use that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.250" end="00:39:10.730" style="s2">word intentionally to sort of get in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.710" end="00:39:15.930" style="s2">little rowboat and row out into the fog</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.730" end="00:39:18.810" style="s2">and try to make sense of of all this and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.930" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">then sort of report back and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.810" end="00:39:24.750" style="s2">trying to build a career or build fame</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:27.569" style="s2">about sort of being the leader who</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.750" end="00:39:31.490" style="s2">speaks at World Economic Forum and had</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.569" end="00:39:33.930" style="s2">and gets the most applause I&#39;m truly</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.490" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">searching for truth in what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.890" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">not going to find it but but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.170" end="00:39:45.090" style="s2">drives me</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.090" end="00:39:52.200" style="s2">I do want to imagine to come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.770" end="00:39:54.150" style="s2">principles I love that you said from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.200" end="00:39:56.940" style="s2">beginning that like this is nothing new</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.150" end="00:39:58.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve always said this about my work i</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.940" end="00:40:02.340" style="s2">synthesize I bring things together</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.620" end="00:40:03.990" style="s2">sometimes as a focus Lass&#39;s innovation</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.340" end="00:40:06.750" style="s2">happens when you connect to things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.990" end="00:40:08.490" style="s2">were previously disconnected so when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.750" end="00:40:10.770" style="s2">do synthesis every now and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.490" end="00:40:15.170" style="s2">should if there&#39;s a spark of something</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.770" end="00:40:17.730" style="s2">new that that is also worth sharing but</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.170" end="00:40:19.200" style="s2">like I was as you were saying other</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.730" end="00:40:22.710" style="s2">people have said this before I thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.200" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">of my one of my mentors and elders John</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.710" end="00:40:29.370" style="s2">Todd and his friends when they started</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:32.130" style="s2">the new alchemy Institute in 1969 look</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.370" end="00:40:34.710" style="s2">at the the statutes of the new alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.130" end="00:40:38.190" style="s2">Institute what they set out to do and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.710" end="00:40:40.470" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely 100% relevant for what</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.190" end="00:40:42.030" style="s2">like if I if I orbit is set up an</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.470" end="00:40:44.490" style="s2">organization I would probably use the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.030" end="00:40:48.330" style="s2">same statues of bats well what marching</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.490" end="00:40:51.080" style="s2">orders are and but you honed in on eight</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.330" end="00:40:55.230" style="s2">principles could you just sum them up</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.080" end="00:40:58.350" style="s2">so so I think the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.230" end="00:40:59.970" style="s2">about my eight principles are really not</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.350" end="00:41:03.270" style="s2">my eight principles but the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.970" end="00:41:07.530" style="s2">principles and and one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.270" end="00:41:09.330" style="s2">learned about the completely about</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.530" end="00:41:12.840" style="s2">complexity science and working in</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.330" end="00:41:17.370" style="s2">complexity is that we and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.840" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">again something that is sacrilege in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.370" end="00:41:23.550" style="s2">business community but we need to accept</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:25.050" style="s2">that we cannot manage complexity Allan</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.550" end="00:41:28.350" style="s2">savory likes to say we need to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.050" end="00:41:31.320" style="s2">dance with complexity and of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.350" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">every CEO believes that their job is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.320" end="00:41:37.350" style="s2">manage their company in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">context and so we set up KPIs and we set</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.350" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">up all this stuff and and we end up you</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:44.370" style="s2">know failing to actually manage</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:46.530" style="s2">complexity and and it comes back and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.370" end="00:41:48.360" style="s2">bites us in the form of you know a Black</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.530" end="00:41:51.660" style="s2">Swan event or a nun you know whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.360" end="00:41:56.040" style="s2">is and and so I think I think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.660" end="00:41:58.110" style="s2">of the idea of principles is that there</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.040" end="00:41:58.650" style="s2">aren&#39;t there are patterns and principles</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.110" end="00:42:01.890" style="s2">of living</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.650" end="00:42:04.559" style="s2">that the kind of giants of living system</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.890" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">science you know it&#39;s not like they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.559" end="00:42:09.059" style="s2">all agreed that here are the eight</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:13.049" style="s2">principles but if you if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.059" end="00:42:14.549" style="s2">show them my a principles or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.049" end="00:42:17.339" style="s2">eight principles you would come up with</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.549" end="00:42:21.180" style="s2">there would be this broad consensus that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.339" end="00:42:23.009" style="s2">yes you know these these patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.180" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">principles roughly describe our</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.009" end="00:42:29.670" style="s2">understanding of living systems what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:31.769" style="s2">got there some me going a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.670" end="00:42:33.690" style="s2">the deep and designed for human and</p>

<p begin="00:42:46.589" end="00:42:51.240" style="s2">I&#39;m pulling it out mainly because in</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.240" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">with you I&#39;ve I pulled together I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.700" end="00:42:57.869" style="s2">there&#39;s so many principles from the</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.450" end="00:43:16.049" style="s2">it and I&#39;ve probably got about 50 lists</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.220" end="00:43:18.539" style="s2">of principles and yesterday they do all</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.049" end="00:43:20.940" style="s2">pretty much converge on what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.539" end="00:43:23.999" style="s2">distilled out with the eight principles</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.940" end="00:43:25.859" style="s2">so in trying to corroborate my didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.999" end="00:43:29.309" style="s2">read and nearly as much of that stuff as</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.859" end="00:43:35.759" style="s2">that came to me was this needs four</p>

<p begin="00:43:41.519" end="00:43:49.529" style="s2">sure principles is is accurate you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.910" end="00:43:52.380" style="s2">maybe the word qualities is more</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.529" end="00:43:56.460" style="s2">accurate like qualities doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.380" end="00:43:58.799" style="s2">challenge people to have to you know it</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.460" end="00:44:01.769" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have this meaning of sort of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.799" end="00:44:05.039" style="s2">declaring what truth is you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.769" end="00:44:08.130" style="s2">less it&#39;s a less aggressive term but</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.039" end="00:44:10.440" style="s2">there certainly are qualities like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.130" end="00:44:12.510" style="s2">fractal patterns of living systems and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.440" end="00:44:14.130" style="s2">like the symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.510" end="00:44:15.900" style="s2">elation ships that are at work in living</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.130" end="00:44:17.730" style="s2">systems that anyone who studied living</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.900" end="00:44:20.820" style="s2">systems will say oh yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.730" end="00:44:23.010" style="s2">and so the the real issue is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.820" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">contextualize them for your purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.010" end="00:44:30.210" style="s2">here&#39;s where as much as I meant believer</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:32.760" style="s2">that there are universal principles for</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.210" end="00:44:34.500" style="s2">some reason those universal principles</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.760" end="00:44:38.130" style="s2">show up differently in different</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.500" end="00:44:39.450" style="s2">contexts so for example I I start out by</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.130" end="00:44:41.820" style="s2">saying well I&#39;m gonna use Janine Benyus</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.450" end="00:44:44.010" style="s2">&#39;as Jeannie is one of my kind of heroes</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.820" end="00:44:44.580" style="s2">I read her book and it&#39;s like oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.010" end="00:44:46.470" style="s2">this is great</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.580" end="00:44:50.420" style="s2">and now all I need to do is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.470" end="00:44:52.860" style="s2">take her her work is largely you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.420" end="00:44:54.420" style="s2">downstream I was confused upstream and</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.860" end="00:44:56.220" style="s2">downstream but you know mostly focused</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.420" end="00:44:58.710" style="s2">because it&#39;s where a client interest is</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.220" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">in a material design and product isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.710" end="00:45:03.060" style="s2">it and so you know part of me as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:06.690" style="s2">all I need to do is shift from that</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.060" end="00:45:07.770" style="s2">context to the system design then apply</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.690" end="00:45:10.080" style="s2">the same principles because their</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.770" end="00:45:12.600" style="s2">principles they must apply yeah but if</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.080" end="00:45:14.430" style="s2">you look at her principles and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.600" end="00:45:16.740" style="s2">think about the context of an economic</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.430" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">system you kind of say yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.740" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they&#39;re wrong but they</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:22.020" style="s2">don&#39;t if you&#39;re gonna live it limit</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:23.490" style="s2">yourself to a finite number of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.020" end="00:45:26.070" style="s2">principles you&#39;re gonna want to select</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.490" end="00:45:28.920" style="s2">some different ones mm-hmm so but but</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.070" end="00:45:31.320" style="s2">again as a friend another friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.920" end="00:45:32.520" style="s2">says this I think it comes from Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.320" end="00:45:34.950" style="s2">you know these are all just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.520" end="00:45:36.390" style="s2">fingers pointing at the moon and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.950" end="00:45:37.560" style="s2">have fingers pointed to moon and my</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.390" end="00:45:39.120" style="s2">fingers are pointed I mean my 8</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.560" end="00:45:41.010" style="s2">principles are my fingers pointing at</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.120" end="00:45:43.980" style="s2">the moon but we can&#39;t confuse the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.010" end="00:45:46.680" style="s2">fingers with the moon and so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.980" end="00:45:49.290" style="s2">really trying to do is reduce using a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.680" end="00:45:52.290" style="s2">reductionist method to as as few as</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.290" end="00:45:55.080" style="s2">possible patterns principles qualities</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.290" end="00:45:58.680" style="s2">whatever work we want to choose that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.080" end="00:46:03.180" style="s2">that allows us to see things through</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.680" end="00:46:06.270" style="s2">this regenerative lens and you know each</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.180" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">of these eight principles you know I</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.270" end="00:46:11.070" style="s2">could spend an hour talking about each</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:13.320" style="s2">one because they all operate at many</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.070" end="00:46:15.480" style="s2">many different levels so for example</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.320" end="00:46:17.580" style="s2">there you know one of them I use is</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.480" end="00:46:19.650" style="s2">called rut in right relationship which</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.580" end="00:46:21.120" style="s2">is a Quaker term that I got from Peter</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.650" end="00:46:24.170" style="s2">Brown he actually wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.120" end="00:46:26.630" style="s2">lean right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.170" end="00:46:30.980" style="s2">that that relationship point makes you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.630" end="00:46:32.750" style="s2">know operates at at a unit a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.980" end="00:46:36.109" style="s2">scale the right relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.750" end="00:46:38.900" style="s2">planet Earth and the Sun is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.109" end="00:46:40.910" style="s2">why we have life on this earth and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.900" end="00:46:46.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.910" end="00:46:49.099" style="s2">quality that is I think manifestly true</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.010" end="00:46:51.170" style="s2">and yet it also operates certainly down</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.099" end="00:46:53.089" style="s2">to the mic the microscope you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.170" end="00:46:55.609" style="s2">cellular level the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.089" end="00:46:57.290" style="s2">the cells in our body are essential to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.609" end="00:46:59.540" style="s2">our health and if that relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.290" end="00:47:01.910" style="s2">not symbiotic and healthy we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.540" end="00:47:03.950" style="s2">healthy and and if we&#39;re living systems</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.910" end="00:47:05.660" style="s2">and the planet is a living system why</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.950" end="00:47:07.460" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t the human economy also be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.660" end="00:47:09.980" style="s2">living system and why wouldn&#39;t that same</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.460" end="00:47:12.890" style="s2">quality of symbiotic relationships</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.980" end="00:47:16.579" style="s2">operate at the level of the of the human</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.890" end="00:47:19.030" style="s2">economy and so you can you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.579" end="00:47:23.510" style="s2">drill down on each of these principles</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.030" end="00:47:26.150" style="s2">individually for hours but the real</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.510" end="00:47:28.190" style="s2">power of the principles is not each of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.150" end="00:47:31.250" style="s2">them individually but when they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.190" end="00:47:34.520" style="s2">operating at the same time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.250" end="00:47:36.020" style="s2">where it&#39;s Carol Sanford and and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.520" end="00:47:39.049" style="s2">Regenesis folks like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.020" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">potential to me that and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.049" end="00:47:44.270" style="s2">this is a hypothesis not even a theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:45.890" style="s2">although I have seen this work in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.270" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">of my investment projects so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.890" end="00:47:50.450" style="s2">personally convinced that it&#39;s real but</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:54.920" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t pretend to have the proof of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.450" end="00:47:57.230" style="s2">that in a scientific sense but but but</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.920" end="00:47:58.910" style="s2">if we can align our economies and our</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.230" end="00:48:02.119" style="s2">businesses with all eight of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.910" end="00:48:05.329" style="s2">principles at all levels of their</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.119" end="00:48:08.180" style="s2">meaning then we unlock immense potential</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.329" end="00:48:11.000" style="s2">that exists that we can&#39;t see today and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.180" end="00:48:11.480" style="s2">my might be you know if I have a big</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.000" end="00:48:13.880" style="s2">idea</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.390" end="00:48:22.309" style="s2">works at eight seven billion people go</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.690" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">we need to shrink back from we need a</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:35.059" style="s2">new source of prosperity and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:37.420" style="s2">that people won&#39;t accept the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.059" end="00:48:41.650" style="s2">limits to growth is because they know in</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.420" end="00:48:43.990" style="s2">that means depression so if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.650" end="00:48:46.869" style="s2">to transition the global economy and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.990" end="00:48:49.170" style="s2">survive as a species we need to find</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.359" end="00:48:56.589" style="s2">beings we need to figure out a way for</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.589" end="00:49:03.540" style="s2">prosperous however we define that and</p>

<p begin="00:49:05.530" end="00:49:10.329" style="s2">ideology says oh well we just need to</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">this idea that if we can shift the human</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.210" end="00:49:46.030" style="s2">theoretical thing you know and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.819" end="00:49:47.500" style="s2">the principles is circulation right they</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.030" end="00:49:49.390" style="s2">you know any living system has a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.500" end="00:49:50.770" style="s2">metabolism and it needs to circulate and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.390" end="00:49:52.869" style="s2">this is very different than just a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.770" end="00:49:54.339" style="s2">circular economy which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.869" end="00:49:55.750" style="s2">important to efficiently use our</p>

<p begin="00:49:55.750" end="00:50:00.339" style="s2">this is circulation meaning healthy</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.119" end="00:50:02.589" style="s2">inputs into the system robust</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.339" end="00:50:04.839" style="s2">circulation into you know all ask all</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.589" end="00:50:10.020" style="s2">parts of the system from the top to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.839" end="00:50:10.020" style="s2">top to the bottom and then an ability to</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.260" end="00:50:14.829" style="s2">emit our waste in a way that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.760" end="00:50:20.710" style="s2">pollute our nest that&#39;s how our</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.829" end="00:50:23.770" style="s2">metabolism works so that circulation</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.770" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">pattern of cascading circulation like</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.710" end="00:50:30.220" style="s2">what circulates at what scale and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:32.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.220" end="00:50:34.049" style="s2">that I find a circular economy people</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.440" end="00:50:36.790" style="s2">aren&#39;t paying enough attention to</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.049" end="00:50:38.940" style="s2">despite the fact that their elders which</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.790" end="00:50:42.670" style="s2">are really the industrial ecologists and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.940" end="00:50:44.349" style="s2">paid a lot of attention to that you read</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.670" end="00:50:46.839" style="s2">the early books on Industrial ecology</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.349" end="00:50:49.869" style="s2">the the kind of they say the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.839" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">punch for the bang for your buck so to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.869" end="00:50:51.430" style="s2">speak if you want to use the old</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:56.980" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.430" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">is by regionalizing but the cycles it</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.980" end="00:51:01.420" style="s2">becomes less efficient and more wasteful</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:03.369" style="s2">the minute the cycles get too long and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.420" end="00:51:05.470" style="s2">that&#39;s where that bit meets with with</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.369" end="00:51:08.049" style="s2">also the double Institute&#39;s called from</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.470" end="00:51:10.990" style="s2">more by regional economies and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.049" end="00:51:12.910" style="s2">mean bioregional ideas is you know again</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.990" end="00:51:15.490" style="s2">you did you know the source of it better</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.910" end="00:51:17.559" style="s2">or not but it it fits perfectly into</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.490" end="00:51:21.250" style="s2">this framework so of course there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.559" end="00:51:25.000" style="s2">reason why it emerged earlier than it</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.250" end="00:51:27.130" style="s2">was then the world was ready for it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.000" end="00:51:30.099" style="s2">I lost my train of thought where I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.130" end="00:51:31.720" style="s2">going going through the principles I</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.099" end="00:51:33.430" style="s2">mean we can you can also tell people</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.720" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">whether where they find the white paper</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.430" end="00:51:37.299" style="s2">so they can look at the principles in</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:40.420" style="s2">more detail because I knew you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.299" end="00:51:43.299" style="s2">ask this question I actually if I can I</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.420" end="00:51:47.380" style="s2">share my screen you can make sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.299" end="00:51:48.609" style="s2">just share it and let me see if I pull</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.380" end="00:51:53.770" style="s2">the right thing up because I actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.609" end="00:51:55.299" style="s2">pulled up here we go just so people can</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.770" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">be looking at it while we&#39;re chatting</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.299" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.700" end="00:52:16.970" style="s2">right now mm-hmm there we go ah I have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.490" end="00:52:20.910" style="s2">pretty graphic right yeah that&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.970" end="00:52:23.220" style="s2">but the the the papers on our on our</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.910" end="00:52:25.020" style="s2">website on the landing page called</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.220" end="00:52:27.210" style="s2">regenerative capitalism how Universal</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.020" end="00:52:29.849" style="s2">patterns and principles will shape the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.210" end="00:52:31.829" style="s2">new economy and there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.849" end="00:52:33.660" style="s2">another paper that is there&#39;s also up</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.829" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">there called finance for a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.660" end="00:52:40.230" style="s2">world which is my attempt to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.480" end="00:52:43.260" style="s2">apply these principles to our financial</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.230" end="00:52:45.300" style="s2">system and and and let them lead us</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.260" end="00:52:47.190" style="s2">toward what we have to do to change our</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.300" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">financial system so that it&#39;s in service</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.190" end="00:52:52.829" style="s2">to a regenerative economy and yet I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:54.660" style="s2">have this all in a book I hope by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.829" end="00:52:57.270" style="s2">end of this year that would be wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.660" end="00:52:59.839" style="s2">like I&#39;ve always felt like the white</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.270" end="00:53:02.280" style="s2">paper is great but we need your book</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.839" end="00:53:04.710" style="s2">just probably the real academic I&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.280" end="00:53:07.980" style="s2">a book out by now it&#39;s hard to write a</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.710" end="00:53:09.990" style="s2">book I wanted to just briefly come back</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.980" end="00:53:14.460" style="s2">to two things or three three things like</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.990" end="00:53:18.150" style="s2">gee you started with um how people just</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.460" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">get it wrong when like complexity has</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.150" end="00:53:22.619" style="s2">become a household term and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.920" end="00:53:24.630" style="s2">when people in leadership positions love</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.619" end="00:53:27.329" style="s2">to talk about managing complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.630" end="00:53:29.970" style="s2">and even emergence and all these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.329" end="00:53:31.859" style="s2">things have become popular in language</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.970" end="00:53:33.140" style="s2">use but I don&#39;t think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.859" end="00:53:38.810" style="s2">understand it very well and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.140" end="00:53:44.099" style="s2">unfortunately even to my mind the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.810" end="00:53:46.589" style="s2">complexity science community has um when</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.099" end="00:53:49.950" style="s2">it first formed where we&#39;re kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.589" end="00:53:52.500" style="s2">old systems theorists met insights from</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.950" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">chaos theory and and created something</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.500" end="00:54:01.530" style="s2">deeper and more dynamic with complex</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:54:03.510" style="s2">adaptive systems as a port phone and one</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.530" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">of the key insights of the early people</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.510" end="00:54:08.790" style="s2">working on this was that complex dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:10.380" style="s2">systems are fundamentally unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.790" end="00:54:13.770" style="s2">and uncontrollable and this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.380" end="00:54:15.630" style="s2">poker is three-body problem of if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.770" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">have more than three interacting</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.630" end="00:54:22.110" style="s2">variables interacting with each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:27.090" style="s2">then you mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.110" end="00:54:29.840" style="s2">have a system that is maybe moving in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.090" end="00:54:32.660" style="s2">strange attractor but but it is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.840" end="00:54:35.610" style="s2">fully predictable and controllable</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.660" end="00:54:39.510" style="s2">limited time frames and limited scale</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.610" end="00:54:42.540" style="s2">and so what about what is and I learned</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.510" end="00:54:45.360" style="s2">these things from Brian Goodwin was one</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.540" end="00:54:49.320" style="s2">of the cofounders of the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.360" end="00:54:51.000" style="s2">Institute was wonderful wonderful man he</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.320" end="00:54:53.970" style="s2">was the highlight of my visit to Shamar</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.000" end="00:54:56.310" style="s2">College no he&#39;s he&#39;s yeah well I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.970" end="00:54:58.910" style="s2">you met him because he he is amazing I</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.310" end="00:55:01.290" style="s2">need to go back and read his book yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.910" end="00:55:02.420" style="s2">all of them makes you but I mean whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.290" end="00:55:06.450" style="s2">the early bio</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.420" end="00:55:08.670" style="s2">biological ones on quite hard reading if</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.450" end="00:55:10.860" style="s2">you&#39;re not a biologist but yeah starting</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.670" end="00:55:13.530" style="s2">with let that changed his spots and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.860" end="00:55:16.650" style="s2">nature&#39;s do they&#39;re really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.530" end="00:55:19.740" style="s2">yeah looks but yeah so slightly do I</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.650" end="00:55:22.110" style="s2">think it&#39;s the one I&#39;ve read and how the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.740" end="00:55:24.050" style="s2">leopard change his spots is more focused</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.110" end="00:55:27.420" style="s2">on complexity but it&#39;s worth reading and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.050" end="00:55:30.180" style="s2">but straight like because we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.420" end="00:55:33.600" style="s2">about but Brian always said that what we</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.180" end="00:55:35.610" style="s2">need and in a way that&#39;s his framing we</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.600" end="00:55:39.720" style="s2">were talking about reductionism and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.610" end="00:55:41.550" style="s2">holism earlier and he he had an another</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.720" end="00:55:44.040" style="s2">nuanced way of framing this way he said</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.550" end="00:55:47.580" style="s2">we have developed a science of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.040" end="00:55:50.340" style="s2">quantities and and indoors economics and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.580" end="00:55:53.910" style="s2">if it claims to be a science is also a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.340" end="00:55:57.300" style="s2">science of quantities and we only like</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.910" end="00:56:00.270" style="s2">the old adage that you hear at nauseam</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.300" end="00:56:03.810" style="s2">only what gets measured gets managed</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.270" end="00:56:06.960" style="s2">yeah yes it has a point but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.810" end="00:56:09.090" style="s2">limiting because what we&#39;re actually and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.960" end="00:56:11.730" style="s2">this is why I&#39;m going with like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.090" end="00:56:13.800" style="s2">mentioned the word qualities and what we</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.730" end="00:56:16.950" style="s2">actually want to regenerate and what</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.800" end="00:56:19.940" style="s2">sustains the web of life is the quality</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.950" end="00:56:24.330" style="s2">of the relationships of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.940" end="00:56:25.670" style="s2">optimizing for all and that nested</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.330" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.670" end="00:56:32.380" style="s2">and M so Brian always said in order to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:36.349" style="s2">shift from like that the deep inside of</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.380" end="00:56:38.059" style="s2">complexity theory is that the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.349" end="00:56:40.490" style="s2">endeavor of trying to predict and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.059" end="00:56:43.160" style="s2">control the world was a mistaken one and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.490" end="00:56:46.609" style="s2">then we need to be humble enough to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.160" end="00:56:49.069" style="s2">accept our not knowing and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.609" end="00:56:51.470" style="s2">is something that will never go away and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.069" end="00:56:53.030" style="s2">therefore to be truly generative and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.470" end="00:56:55.190" style="s2">regenerative we have to keep learning</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.030" end="00:56:57.619" style="s2">and keep responding because we&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.190" end="00:57:00.200" style="s2">of the system and everything we do as as</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.619" end="00:57:02.390" style="s2">my friend Gerald meetry professor of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.200" end="00:57:04.010" style="s2">system signs them at Hull and since</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.390" end="00:57:07.790" style="s2">everything is an intervention</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.010" end="00:57:10.280" style="s2">we the messed as participants then what</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.790" end="00:57:13.579" style="s2">we do or what we don&#39;t do each and every</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.280" end="00:57:17.359" style="s2">one of us changes the whole M and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.579" end="00:57:19.460" style="s2">what but but to guide our what Brian</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.359" end="00:57:19.910" style="s2">called appropriate participation in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.460" end="00:57:23.150" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.910" end="00:57:26.119" style="s2">we need a signs of qualities as well as</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.150" end="00:57:29.420" style="s2">the signs of quantities so I really like</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.119" end="00:57:31.339" style="s2">you reframing the principles which for</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.420" end="00:57:34.730" style="s2">me have always sounded a little bit true</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.339" end="00:57:37.460" style="s2">hard and to your M get on my bandwagon</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.730" end="00:57:39.170" style="s2">and follow my principles I&#39;ve just come</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.460" end="00:57:42.770" style="s2">down from the mountain and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.170" end="00:57:45.589" style="s2">story habits to to something much softer</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.770" end="00:57:47.569" style="s2">but actually much deeper and the one</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.589" end="00:57:48.890" style="s2">more bit I mean you read some of my work</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.569" end="00:57:54.650" style="s2">and you know that I&#39;m a bit of success</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.890" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">with questions and have you seen like in</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.650" end="00:57:58.280" style="s2">my book I do</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:58:00.589" style="s2">Aikido with your eight principles and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.280" end="00:58:02.690" style="s2">honored them but I turned them all into</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.589" end="00:58:04.670" style="s2">questions but yeah and I read something</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.690" end="00:58:06.349" style="s2">recently of yours where you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.670" end="00:58:10.119" style="s2">that and I think it&#39;s terrific that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.349" end="00:58:15.020" style="s2">think they the I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.119" end="00:58:16.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a tool to to enable a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.020" end="00:58:21.710" style="s2">conversation to take place as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.940" end="00:58:27.380" style="s2">a you know way I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.710" end="00:58:31.640" style="s2">word is a you know a competing idea idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.380" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">fest or whatever but I say wherever I</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.640" end="00:58:36.380" style="s2">can that the important thing about quote</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:39.079" style="s2">my principles</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.380" end="00:58:41.569" style="s2">is not that they are right but</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.079" end="00:58:45.670" style="s2">that they are one man&#39;s best effort to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.569" end="00:58:48.410" style="s2">reduce to as few a number as possible a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.670" end="00:58:50.930" style="s2">pattern that we need to get into</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.410" end="00:58:54.589" style="s2">alignment with and and that none of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.930" end="00:58:57.619" style="s2">are my ideas they come from my research</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.589" end="00:59:01.489" style="s2">and my experience in working in the real</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.619" end="00:59:02.959" style="s2">world and I think the the reason I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.489" end="00:59:07.640" style="s2">passionate about them is that that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.959" end="00:59:09.410" style="s2">actually seen the and I could go through</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.640" end="00:59:11.779" style="s2">each and every one of these and give an</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.410" end="00:59:14.839" style="s2">example and I do in the paper and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.779" end="00:59:15.650" style="s2">do a better job in the book but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.839" end="00:59:19.609" style="s2">seen them</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.650" end="00:59:21.829" style="s2">not only operate in projects that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.609" end="00:59:24.589" style="s2">been involved in but I&#39;ve seen them in</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.829" end="00:59:27.890" style="s2">operation in 50 projects that we&#39;ve told</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.589" end="00:59:30.380" style="s2">the story about where they&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.890" end="00:59:32.029" style="s2">happened organically or the or the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.380" end="00:59:36.440" style="s2">leaders of the projects have intuited</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.029" end="00:59:38.390" style="s2">them and and and never even certainly</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.440" end="00:59:40.759" style="s2">never read my paper but never even</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.390" end="00:59:42.920" style="s2">thought of them as principles it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.759" end="00:59:44.809" style="s2">what they naturally do in response to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.920" end="00:59:48.349" style="s2">the pressures that they are dealing in</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.809" end="00:59:50.630" style="s2">and so it&#39;s further evidence that this</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.349" end="00:59:52.910" style="s2">regenerative economy is an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.630" end="00:59:56.390" style="s2">phenomenon in response to the pressures</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.910" end="00:59:59.749" style="s2">of the old system and you know something</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.390" end="01:00:02.390" style="s2">as simple as a as a farmers market and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.749" end="01:00:04.519" style="s2">and the whole local food to you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.390" end="01:00:06.739" style="s2">food to table movement are in alignment</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.519" end="01:00:09.170" style="s2">with these principles and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.739" end="01:00:11.779" style="s2">because some you know folks read John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.170" end="01:00:14.660" style="s2">paper that&#39;s because they&#39;re responding</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.779" end="01:00:18.140" style="s2">to the pressures and the context that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.660" end="01:00:21.049" style="s2">destroying our food system and so to me</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.140" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">the the proof that they&#39;re real is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.049" end="01:00:26.420" style="s2">they&#39;re already emergent in the real</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:29.449" style="s2">world and and for me the value of trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.420" end="01:00:33.199" style="s2">to reduce them to language is to help us</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.449" end="01:00:35.479" style="s2">all to see this source of future</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.199" end="01:00:39.619" style="s2">prosperity and the direction we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.479" end="01:00:42.349" style="s2">go and to show where our current</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.619" end="01:00:45.079" style="s2">paradigm is completely in conflict with</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.349" end="01:00:47.630" style="s2">these principles and so it shows us</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.079" end="01:00:49.759" style="s2">where we need to you know focus our</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.630" end="01:00:51.289" style="s2">attention to change things and then the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.759" end="01:00:53.260" style="s2">final point I make about them is that it</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.289" end="01:00:57.430" style="s2">helps us you know our</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.260" end="01:00:59.080" style="s2">so for example the entire you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.430" end="01:01:03.010" style="s2">quote-unquote sustainable finance</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.080" end="01:01:05.920" style="s2">industry is largely centered around this</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.010" end="01:01:08.770" style="s2">idea that John Elkington put forth 25</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.920" end="01:01:11.470" style="s2">years ago called triple bottom-line the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.770" end="01:01:13.150" style="s2">idea if we need to shift from a sink a</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.470" end="01:01:14.980" style="s2">single bottom-line profit and loss</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.150" end="01:01:18.520" style="s2">statement to a triple bottom line where</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.980" end="01:01:22.330" style="s2">we value planet and people and it was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.520" end="01:01:24.970" style="s2">brilliant insight and it still holds</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.330" end="01:01:27.869" style="s2">truth interestingly John issued a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.970" end="01:01:31.210" style="s2">product recall on the idea let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.869" end="01:01:33.010" style="s2">about a year or so ago because he he</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.210" end="01:01:36.160" style="s2">essentially realized that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.010" end="01:01:37.900" style="s2">working but the entire sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.160" end="01:01:39.640" style="s2">finance industry is largely organized</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.900" end="01:01:42.820" style="s2">around that idea and it&#39;s now morphed</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.640" end="01:01:45.820" style="s2">into big corporations and impact</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.820" end="01:01:50.670" style="s2">investing and ESG measures and public</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.820" end="01:01:55.300" style="s2">companies and and of course that entire</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.670" end="01:01:58.840" style="s2">analysis is the absent sort of a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.300" end="01:02:02.080" style="s2">a check against principles and if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.840" end="01:02:04.300" style="s2">checked against principles and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.080" end="01:02:06.040" style="s2">talking specifically about the problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.300" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">of the public corporation and public</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.040" end="01:02:11.650" style="s2">capital markets so so the premise of ESG</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:13.690" style="s2">is that if we make the e and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.650" end="01:02:16.900" style="s2">environmental and social and government</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.690" end="01:02:19.450" style="s2">governance issues transparent the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.900" end="01:02:21.730" style="s2">markets will solve this problem because</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.450" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">markets you know we believe in a market</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.730" end="01:02:26.170" style="s2">system and if markets have the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:28.869" style="s2">information they do their magic you know</p>

<p begin="01:02:28.869" end="01:02:36.130" style="s2">all kinds of unquestioned assumptions in</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.740" end="01:02:38.170" style="s2">that theory of change I would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.130" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">markets or tools markets aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.170" end="01:02:42.940" style="s2">source of our truth and some tools work</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:45.609" style="s2">better than others in different contexts</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.940" end="01:02:48.070" style="s2">but but the problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.609" end="01:02:50.170" style="s2">multinational corporation today if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.070" end="01:02:51.850" style="s2">look at these eight principles while</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.170" end="01:02:55.510" style="s2">there are many problems but probably the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.850" end="01:02:57.460" style="s2">fundamental one is that we have severed</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.510" end="01:02:59.109" style="s2">the most important in a capitalist</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.460" end="01:03:01.720" style="s2">system their relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.109" end="01:03:02.440" style="s2">owner of capital and the enterprise is</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.720" end="01:03:04.420" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.440" end="01:03:06.609" style="s2">it&#39;s as fundamental as the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.420" end="01:03:07.930" style="s2">between the company and its customers</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.609" end="01:03:09.880" style="s2">perhaps even more fundamental because</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.930" end="01:03:12.789" style="s2">you can always get new customers but you</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.880" end="01:03:14.619" style="s2">do have an owner and that relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.789" end="01:03:16.539" style="s2">of the owner of capital and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.619" end="01:03:18.369" style="s2">enterprise is fundamental to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.539" end="01:03:20.859" style="s2">capitalist system that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.369" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">functional and so for example if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.859" end="01:03:24.670" style="s2">have buildings owned by people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:27.880" style="s2">care about fixing the roof you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.670" end="01:03:30.460" style="s2">to have leaky buildings and and and bad</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.880" end="01:03:34.119" style="s2">housing well what about a multinational</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.460" end="01:03:37.690" style="s2">corporation the efficiency of capital</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.119" end="01:03:39.430" style="s2">markets has essentially separated the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.690" end="01:03:42.099" style="s2">relationship between the owners of</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.430" end="01:03:44.950" style="s2">capital and the enterprise so now</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.099" end="01:03:47.170" style="s2">instead of an owner showing up and</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.950" end="01:03:48.430" style="s2">saying boy we need to shift our business</p>

<p begin="01:04:19.809" end="01:04:24.279" style="s2">way we need it to and so we&#39;ve spent 25</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.269" end="01:04:26.980" style="s2">years we built an entire industry around</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.279" end="01:04:29.160" style="s2">ESG and it&#39;s made incremental progress</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.980" end="01:04:31.960" style="s2">don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m a fan of the ESG</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.160" end="01:04:33.819" style="s2">but it hasn&#39;t dealt with the fundamental</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.910" end="01:04:58.450" style="s2">honestly I haven&#39;t heard it quite so</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.450" end="01:05:01.239" style="s2">clearly expressed before and there but</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.450" end="01:05:03.099" style="s2">but what it makes me think is that like</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.239" end="01:05:06.099" style="s2">I to things like on the one hand I was</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.099" end="01:05:09.519" style="s2">just reminded of because you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.099" end="01:05:13.299" style="s2">John Elkington doing a product recall on</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.519" end="01:05:13.790" style="s2">the triple bottom line mmm maybe at some</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.299" end="01:05:15.110" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.790" end="01:05:17.050" style="s2">should have a conversation between the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.110" end="01:05:19.400" style="s2">three of us I would love to do - that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.050" end="01:05:22.790" style="s2">would be really interesting to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.400" end="01:05:24.140" style="s2">the two of you together John&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.790" end="01:05:26.360" style="s2">regenerative bandwagon now</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.140" end="01:05:27.620" style="s2">yeah no no he&#39;s the easy I was really</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.360" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">surprised because he actually reached</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.620" end="01:05:33.770" style="s2">out to me and we had a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:39.320" style="s2">conversations yeah and wonderful man and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.770" end="01:05:42.950" style="s2">I was going with em I first heard him</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.320" end="01:05:44.780" style="s2">say that at reporting 3.0 which seemed</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.950" end="01:05:48.530" style="s2">to be very aligned with a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.780" end="01:05:50.240" style="s2">what the Capitol Institute is proposing</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.530" end="01:05:55.490" style="s2">yeah those guys are doing great work</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.240" end="01:05:57.440" style="s2">yeah and in last year I saw Nora Bateson</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.490" end="01:05:59.660" style="s2">also at reporting three point or say</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.440" end="01:06:02.510" style="s2">something to a group of people that all</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.660" end="01:06:04.640" style="s2">celebrate themselves as positive metrics</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.510" end="01:06:07.850" style="s2">and they are really well-meaning people</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.640" end="01:06:09.680" style="s2">who are trying to work on shifting the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.850" end="01:06:12.650" style="s2">reporting industry and now even going</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:14.750" style="s2">beyond reporting um in order to to</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.650" end="01:06:19.790" style="s2">effect this conundrum that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.750" end="01:06:23.240" style="s2">about um and she said something that as</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.790" end="01:06:25.220" style="s2">Nora just knows how to do everybody had</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.240" end="01:06:26.930" style="s2">been talking about we we can&#39;t do with</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.220" end="01:06:29.480" style="s2">incremental change anymore we need</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.930" end="01:06:31.220" style="s2">transformative change and and then at</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.480" end="01:06:32.810" style="s2">the very end of everybody proposing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.220" end="01:06:35.900" style="s2">transformative changes it was Nora&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.810" end="01:06:38.390" style="s2">turn to ask everybody in the room to say</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.900" end="01:06:40.700" style="s2">are we double checking that what we</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.390" end="01:06:44.300" style="s2">calling transformative in MA innovation</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.700" end="01:06:46.400" style="s2">is gonna make sure that we end up with</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.300" end="01:06:49.430" style="s2">butterflies and not with caterpillars</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.400" end="01:06:52.760" style="s2">with wings and I think that that image</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.430" end="01:06:54.800" style="s2">just brings it down so deeply and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.760" end="01:06:57.650" style="s2">now bringing that back home to what you</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.800" end="01:06:59.630" style="s2">just said and I would like to end</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.650" end="01:07:02.030" style="s2">because otherwise we&#39;ll probably end up</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.630" end="01:07:04.190" style="s2">having a three-hour recording and with</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.030" end="01:07:06.110" style="s2">coming home to the question of bio</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.190" end="01:07:09.340" style="s2">regionalism because what I heard you say</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.110" end="01:07:11.450" style="s2">earlier is that that kind of divorced</p>

<p begin="01:07:11.450" end="01:07:16.370" style="s2">owner has nothing to do really in</p>

<p begin="01:07:30.570" end="01:07:35.640" style="s2">principles are wonderful and where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.240" end="01:07:41.460" style="s2">what called qualities quality these</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.640" end="01:07:44.100" style="s2">these qualities are preferred in right</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.460" end="01:07:47.280" style="s2">right relationship and even the image of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.100" end="01:07:49.890" style="s2">that in right relationship on what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.280" end="01:07:51.720" style="s2">the screen right now kind of speaks to</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.890" end="01:07:56.580" style="s2">that nested wholeness and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.720" end="01:08:00.720" style="s2">well if we are to redeem the word</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.580" end="01:08:03.270" style="s2">capitalism and redesign our economic</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.720" end="01:08:05.850" style="s2">system in a way that it shifts from</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.270" end="01:08:11.430" style="s2">being exploited if and degenerative to</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.850" end="01:08:13.410" style="s2">being healing and regenerative I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.430" end="01:08:16.650" style="s2">we need to pay attention to scales and I</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.410" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">was really delighted when I when I read</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.650" end="01:08:20.730" style="s2">in with regenerative communities network</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.960" end="01:08:22.290" style="s2">and all that the wonderful network that</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.730" end="01:08:24.480" style="s2">the capital Institute has helped birth</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.290" end="01:08:26.940" style="s2">with these initiatives around the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.480" end="01:08:29.850" style="s2">where people are committing to trying to</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.940" end="01:08:32.760" style="s2">regenerate economic activity at the bio</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.850" end="01:08:35.910" style="s2">regional scale and trying to look into</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.760" end="01:08:38.400" style="s2">providing basic human needs and a new</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.910" end="01:08:41.850" style="s2">kind of prosperity to people in place</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.400" end="01:08:45.090" style="s2">sourced out of place at that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.850" end="01:08:46.950" style="s2">watershed scale and is for me after</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.090" end="01:08:48.660" style="s2">spending a lot of time looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.950" end="01:08:50.280" style="s2">community scale and intentional</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.660" end="01:08:53.630" style="s2">communities and little experiments of</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.280" end="01:08:57.000" style="s2">how do we walk our talk I realized that</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.630" end="01:08:58.320" style="s2">you need the bio regional scale you need</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.000" end="01:09:00.390" style="s2">a city and there you need small</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.320" end="01:09:02.760" style="s2">communities you need ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.390" end="01:09:04.860" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a larger scale at which the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.760" end="01:09:06.600" style="s2">whole system&#39;s design where these kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.860" end="01:09:10.140" style="s2">of principles can really come together</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.600" end="01:09:11.970" style="s2">to transform something happens so I</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.140" end="01:09:13.890" style="s2">would love for you to just reflect a</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.970" end="01:09:16.350" style="s2">little bit on why you think that by</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.890" end="01:09:22.070" style="s2">regional scale is important and and also</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.350" end="01:09:22.070" style="s2">how would you envision this new economic</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.179" end="01:09:28.699" style="s2">to be fractal just like nature is in its</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.659" end="01:09:30.199" style="s2">dimension where we of course we will</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.699" end="01:09:33.290" style="s2">have global trade and we will have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.199" end="01:09:36.020" style="s2">global economy but how can we heal that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.290" end="01:09:41.029" style="s2">global economy by regionalizing Andrey</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.020" end="01:09:45.469" style="s2">localizing it hmm yeah of course the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.029" end="01:09:51.290" style="s2">idea of local is not a new idea but</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.469" end="01:09:59.170" style="s2">local is a it&#39;s a it doesn&#39;t it does a</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.290" end="01:09:59.170" style="s2">disservice to the the profound</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.380" end="01:10:07.640" style="s2">importance of of this shift away from</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:10.460" style="s2">global national to by a regional and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.640" end="01:10:15.170" style="s2">and because bioregional is where you</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.460" end="01:10:18.679" style="s2">know it&#39;s where the geological facts a</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.170" end="01:10:21.800" style="s2">river system a mountain range an ocean a</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.679" end="01:10:24.350" style="s2">coastal plain geological facts that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.800" end="01:10:28.730" style="s2">not changing anytime soon</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.350" end="01:10:32.570" style="s2">well hopefully not come into contact</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.730" end="01:10:34.870" style="s2">with human culture so where that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.570" end="01:10:39.440" style="s2">context here is human economy and</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.870" end="01:10:43.340" style="s2">geological facts and the the nature that</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.440" end="01:10:46.100" style="s2">they enable and human culture is comes</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.340" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">into contact in a bio regional scale and</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.100" end="01:10:50.870" style="s2">and I think when people think about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.320" end="01:10:54.020" style="s2">wherever you live or wherever you call</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.870" end="01:10:56.750" style="s2">home you can get a vision of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.020" end="01:11:00.020" style="s2">unique about that place that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.750" end="01:11:02.449" style="s2">from other places and if people have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.020" end="01:11:04.909" style="s2">choice they tend to move to a place that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.449" end="01:11:06.890" style="s2">is either what they know because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.909" end="01:11:10.210" style="s2">where they grew up or what they are</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.890" end="01:11:12.320" style="s2">attracted to for some you know almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.210" end="01:11:13.940" style="s2">spiritual reasons some people are</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.320" end="01:11:17.630" style="s2">attracted to mountains some people are</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.940" end="01:11:20.320" style="s2">attracted to the ocean etc and so to me</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.630" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">it is the sort of self-evident truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.320" end="01:11:29.110" style="s2">that it is that is where living systems</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:32.989" style="s2">living human systems are grounded and</p>

<p begin="01:12:07.969" end="01:12:12.920" style="s2">their eyes and imagine the map of the</p>

<p begin="01:12:41.449" end="01:12:47.749" style="s2">Watership of a watershed map and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.999" end="01:12:49.969" style="s2">another zooks I can probably pull it up</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.749" end="01:12:53.539" style="s2">quickly when I&#39;m chatting but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.969" end="01:12:59.090" style="s2">there&#39;s that brilliant because you you</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.539" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">can see the the watershed context of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.090" end="01:13:06.860" style="s2">whole planet and where it aligns with</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:09.590" style="s2">nations and where doesn&#39;t and so any</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.860" end="01:13:11.510" style="s2">rate the to answer your question you</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.590" end="01:13:14.090" style="s2">know one of our principles is this idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.510" end="01:13:18.199" style="s2">of honoring community in place and and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.090" end="01:13:21.229" style="s2">use the word honor you know by intention</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.199" end="01:13:25.389" style="s2">obviously and again this is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.229" end="01:13:29.530" style="s2">humans being humble to the greater</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.389" end="01:13:32.749" style="s2">essence and and nature of place that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.530" end="01:13:35.209" style="s2">exists whether or not were there you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.749" end="01:13:39.019" style="s2">know and and you know Wendell Berry has</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.209" end="01:13:41.780" style="s2">this beautiful expression I see as he</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.019" end="01:13:44.780" style="s2">only he can do he says there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.780" end="01:13:48.249" style="s2">thing as a unsay credly</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.780" end="01:13:50.500" style="s2">there&#39;s only sacred places and</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.249" end="01:13:54.920" style="s2">desecrated places</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.500" end="01:13:57.440" style="s2">and and so I think you know partly as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.920" end="01:14:00.860" style="s2">practical way to get our hands around</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:03.050" style="s2">this challenge if we if we try to</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.860" end="01:14:05.570" style="s2">operate on a global scale or a big</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.050" end="01:14:08.510" style="s2">nation scale it&#39;s too much it&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.570" end="01:14:10.130" style="s2">for me to hold in my head mmm I work and</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.510" end="01:14:12.740" style="s2">we now have I don&#39;t know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.130" end="01:14:15.290" style="s2">probably 15 active by original</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.740" end="01:14:18.110" style="s2">initiatives and I&#39;ve been around most of</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.290" end="01:14:20.690" style="s2">them I see all these same patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.110" end="01:14:23.060" style="s2">principles showing up I see the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.690" end="01:14:25.580" style="s2">quality so whether you&#39;re on an island</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.060" end="01:14:28.280" style="s2">off of Newfoundland in Canada or in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.580" end="01:14:30.620" style="s2">rainforest in Costa Rica they all look</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.280" end="01:14:32.780" style="s2">the same to me now this this emergent</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.620" end="01:14:36.710" style="s2">regenerative community regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.780" end="01:14:38.900" style="s2">culture is is the same in these</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.710" end="01:14:43.840" style="s2">different contexts but it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.900" end="01:14:46.400" style="s2">as a practical reality obviously a</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.840" end="01:14:48.920" style="s2">tropical culture is going to feel very</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.400" end="01:14:51.650" style="s2">different than an Arctic culture and an</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.920" end="01:14:53.240" style="s2">Arctic economy but that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.650" end="01:14:57.080" style="s2">qualities or the patterns are so</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.240" end="01:14:58.670" style="s2">important and and if you look at each of</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.080" end="01:15:00.890" style="s2">these initiatives through a regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.670" end="01:15:03.230" style="s2">lens you see these same qualities</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.890" end="01:15:06.170" style="s2">appearing in their own unique context</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.230" end="01:15:08.390" style="s2">and so you know I like to say every</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.170" end="01:15:11.630" style="s2">snowflake is unique but every snowflake</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.390" end="01:15:14.690" style="s2">looks like a snowflake and what my hope</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.630" end="01:15:17.210" style="s2">is in linking these initiatives together</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.690" end="01:15:20.630" style="s2">and by the way you know you could you</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.210" end="01:15:24.250" style="s2">could you could identify a PhD thesis</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.630" end="01:15:27.170" style="s2">they could write a paper or a book on</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.250" end="01:15:29.600" style="s2">thousands of bioregional communities</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.170" end="01:15:32.390" style="s2">that are emerging and expressing these</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.600" end="01:15:35.170" style="s2">regenerative qualities their whole I</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.390" end="01:15:38.510" style="s2">just looked on in Egypt called psyche</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.170" end="01:15:40.580" style="s2">yeah I mean basically just within the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.510" end="01:15:42.560" style="s2">global eco village Network and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.580" end="01:15:45.140" style="s2">influences that each one of these older</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.560" end="01:15:47.300" style="s2">eco villages had on their region whether</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.140" end="01:15:49.960" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of the more a shia region</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.300" end="01:15:51.670" style="s2">around fintan i or the region in</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.960" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">Pondicherry around</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.670" end="01:15:56.870" style="s2">Oroville in India or even the region</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.800" end="01:16:00.050" style="s2">around Tamera and Portugal that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.870" end="01:16:02.640" style="s2">transforming having had that nucleus</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.050" end="01:16:04.440" style="s2">where people are exploring the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.640" end="01:16:07.260" style="s2">different way of being with the world</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.440" end="01:16:08.370" style="s2">has had influence in the wider region</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.370" end="01:16:14.550" style="s2">enough now the problem today is that</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.150" end="01:16:17.970" style="s2">they&#39;re all largely diffused and</p>

<p begin="01:17:18.900" end="01:17:25.890" style="s2">actually one thing and then and nurture</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.590" end="01:17:32.610" style="s2">our hope is that each of these</p>

<p begin="01:17:32.610" end="01:17:38.520" style="s2">capitalism comes back the the</p>

<p begin="01:18:26.940" end="01:18:30.870" style="s2">it&#39;s happening you know the entire</p>

<p begin="01:18:41.220" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">will be looking for you know let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.830" end="01:18:48.210" style="s2">again an old language low risk low</p>

<p begin="01:18:57.360" end="01:19:03.270" style="s2">have matured from 15 initiatives to 1500</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.900" end="01:19:05.850" style="s2">initiatives and that they will have kind</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.220" end="01:19:12.780" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to t it&#39;s a sort of T up</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.590" end="01:19:14.580" style="s2">all of these things that are going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.780" end="01:19:16.230" style="s2">help all these projects that will help</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.580" end="01:19:18.510" style="s2">transform them into a regenerative</p>

<p begin="01:19:18.510" end="01:19:22.680" style="s2">find such projects but if we do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.240" end="01:19:24.650" style="s2">disparate way where everyone&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.680" end="01:19:27.060" style="s2">their own thing all over the world</p>

<p begin="01:19:30.900" end="01:19:35.430" style="s2">little project there mr. Fullerton but</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.600" end="01:19:36.900" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve got four billion dollars</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.430" end="01:19:38.790" style="s2">and if you want me to invest forty</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.390" end="01:19:58.170" style="s2">realized that there is this parallel</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.760" end="01:19:59.670" style="s2">because you know that like I mean the</p>

<p begin="01:20:02.580" end="01:20:08.220" style="s2">birth out of the frustration of the mush</p>

<p begin="01:20:33.659" end="01:20:40.320" style="s2">nice thing too to be able to do but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.420" end="01:20:42.510" style="s2">peanuts of money and the frustration of</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.320" end="01:20:44.369" style="s2">choosing out of these 50 was always</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.510" end="01:20:47.030" style="s2">extremely high and what was born out of</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.369" end="01:20:49.769" style="s2">that was the conversation of how do we</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.030" end="01:20:51.539" style="s2">give more value to all these runner-ups</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.769" end="01:20:53.099" style="s2">that have already gone through a due</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.539" end="01:20:55.619" style="s2">diligence processes and have been</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.099" end="01:20:57.539" style="s2">checked on by the people from the</p>

<p begin="01:20:57.539" end="01:21:03.539" style="s2">than the judges and how do we a showcase</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.840" end="01:21:05.519" style="s2">them to the world make them visible to</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.539" end="01:21:07.979" style="s2">each other so they don&#39;t feel alone in</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.519" end="01:21:09.960" style="s2">in their in their struggle and showcase</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.979" end="01:21:12.030" style="s2">them to possible funders and in that</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.960" end="01:21:13.619" style="s2">conversation which is matured with now</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.030" end="01:21:17.729" style="s2">the Buckminster Fuller Institute in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.619" end="01:21:19.380" style="s2">capital in voter has the same name what</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.729" end="01:21:21.269" style="s2">the Bucky fuller prize yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.380" end="01:21:22.920" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what like I I said too</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.269" end="01:21:25.159" style="s2">much we&#39;re not the only ones who are</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.920" end="01:21:28.889" style="s2">running a prize where the front end is</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.159" end="01:21:32.099" style="s2">cheaper than the back end so it costs</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.889" end="01:21:36.539" style="s2">more than we give away and then we end</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.099" end="01:21:38.610" style="s2">up with all these these runner ups that</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.539" end="01:21:41.789" style="s2">that have been vetted but nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.610" end="01:21:43.710" style="s2">giving value to that and so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.789" end="01:21:45.030" style="s2">suggested let&#39;s let&#39;s talk to battements</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.710" end="01:21:47.219" style="s2">the fuller they must have exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.030" end="01:21:49.349" style="s2">same problem and now this has evolved</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.219" end="01:21:51.900" style="s2">into the regional rasa tea platform that</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.349" end="01:21:52.889" style="s2">hopefully will be launched soon and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.900" end="01:21:55.559" style="s2">is brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.889" end="01:21:57.510" style="s2">you know what we need to do is that so</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.559" end="01:22:00.059" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be interrelationships</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.510" end="01:22:03.539" style="s2">between all that all of those projects</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.059" end="01:22:04.949" style="s2">and let&#39;s say there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.539" end="01:22:06.630" style="s2">got to be let&#39;s just put a number</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.949" end="01:22:09.110" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be a hundred projects in</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.630" end="01:22:12.150" style="s2">those databases and there are viable</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.110" end="01:22:15.690" style="s2">thriving things that should be scaled</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.150" end="01:22:17.190" style="s2">out and replicated and and maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.690" end="01:22:20.789" style="s2">thousand but it&#39;s probably at least a</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.190" end="01:22:26.579" style="s2">hundred and and imagine if then they</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.789" end="01:22:30.449" style="s2">were the the kind of the flywheel or the</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.579" end="01:22:32.429" style="s2">engine to build co-benefits within each</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.449" end="01:22:34.499" style="s2">of their bio regions so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.429" end="01:22:37.530" style="s2">again not isolated projects working in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.499" end="01:22:39.269" style="s2">great big wide world on their own but we</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.530" end="01:22:42.210" style="s2">harness the energy that they&#39;re throwing</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.269" end="01:22:43.860" style="s2">off already into bio regions so they</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.210" end="01:22:46.500" style="s2">so that we get this amplifying effect</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.860" end="01:22:48.840" style="s2">out of bioregional scale that&#39;s that to</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.500" end="01:22:51.450" style="s2">me is the you know that the hard thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.840" end="01:22:53.820" style="s2">is to build a flywheel once you get a</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.450" end="01:22:56.730" style="s2">flywheel going it gets much easier to</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.820" end="01:22:59.670" style="s2">build on it and and and flywheels</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.730" end="01:23:02.940" style="s2">usually take courage and creativity and</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.670" end="01:23:05.880" style="s2">capital and guts and sweat and tears to</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.940" end="01:23:07.650" style="s2">get going so what we need to do is find</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.880" end="01:23:11.310" style="s2">the flywheels that are regenerative and</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.650" end="01:23:14.239" style="s2">then you know throw energy at them which</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.310" end="01:23:18.600" style="s2">is people and and money and expertise</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.239" end="01:23:20.760" style="s2">and help them to spread that energy in</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.600" end="01:23:22.560" style="s2">their bio regions and then the</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.760" end="01:23:24.630" style="s2">bioregions start exchanging with each</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.560" end="01:23:26.310" style="s2">other and then you essentially before</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.630" end="01:23:29.100" style="s2">you know it you&#39;ve got your new you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.310" end="01:23:30.810" style="s2">reinvented capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.100" end="01:23:33.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the regenerative economy</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.810" end="01:23:35.100" style="s2">that&#39;s operating at a bio retail scale</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.000" end="01:23:36.450" style="s2">and then the politicians will wake up</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.100" end="01:23:38.250" style="s2">and say oh there&#39;s something good going</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.450" end="01:23:40.880" style="s2">on over there why don&#39;t we settle</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.250" end="01:23:43.380" style="s2">policies support that stuff rather than</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.880" end="01:23:46.560" style="s2">supporting you know subsidizing fossil</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.380" end="01:23:49.880" style="s2">fuels well I had a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.560" end="01:23:52.110" style="s2">James quill again who has been advising</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.880" end="01:23:53.969" style="s2">like we eat on the one hand did this</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.110" end="01:23:57.510" style="s2">wonderful study of the the bio region of</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.969" end="01:23:58.890" style="s2">the San Francisco watershed but as a</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.510" end="01:24:00.390" style="s2">political adviser I mean he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.890" end="01:24:03.239" style="s2">advising governments all over the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.390" end="01:24:08.850" style="s2">for his whole career and he&#39;s also had</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.239" end="01:24:11.400" style="s2">some work with um the IMF and even in</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.850" end="01:24:14.760" style="s2">the corridors of the IMF I won&#39;t say who</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.400" end="01:24:18.690" style="s2">people have actually said show me the</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.760" end="01:24:23.790" style="s2">example of a viable bioregional economy</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.690" end="01:24:26.280" style="s2">at and and vibrant by regional economy</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.790" end="01:24:28.230" style="s2">and its patterns and we need to shift to</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.280" end="01:24:30.120" style="s2">support this but wait so we need to just</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.230" end="01:24:32.160" style="s2">create to make these things visible if</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.120" end="01:24:34.110" style="s2">you if you stop sharing your screen then</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.160" end="01:24:40.489" style="s2">I&#39;ve just had while you were talking a</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.110" end="01:24:45.900" style="s2">bit of a fiddle and lost control and</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.489" end="01:24:49.020" style="s2">then I be able to just see then I share</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.900" end="01:24:52.230" style="s2">this I work and yeah and I can share</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.020" end="01:24:55.230" style="s2">this briefly what&#39;s now you can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.230" end="01:24:58.710" style="s2">you see this beautiful everyone that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.230" end="01:25:00.810" style="s2">Robert zukes yeah he&#39;s a geographer and</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.710" end="01:25:04.520" style="s2">he this is real scientific data of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.810" end="01:25:07.160" style="s2">basically the world&#39;s fire regions huh</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.520" end="01:25:09.270" style="s2">what the word watershed watersheds</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.160" end="01:25:11.670" style="s2">watersheds in here like you can see the</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.270" end="01:25:15.300" style="s2">Mississippi watershed the Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.670" end="01:25:16.560" style="s2">watershed here and the Nile this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.300" end="01:25:18.810" style="s2">whole this green thing is the Nile</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.560" end="01:25:21.570" style="s2">watershed and of course they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.810" end="01:25:23.430" style="s2">very large and some of these so my sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.570" end="01:25:26.940" style="s2">is that some of these mega watersheds</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.430" end="01:25:29.100" style="s2">might might feasibly be divided into sub</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.940" end="01:25:31.620" style="s2">bio regions within the watershed</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.100" end="01:25:34.880" style="s2">I mean bioregions is a loose term as I</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.620" end="01:25:37.680" style="s2">understand it it doesn&#39;t have a firm</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.880" end="01:25:40.110" style="s2">definition you sort of know it when you</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.680" end="01:25:41.400" style="s2">feel it kind of thing but they if you go</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.110" end="01:25:44.790" style="s2">back for a second one thing I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.400" end="01:25:48.270" style="s2">point out about the United States and</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.790" end="01:25:51.150" style="s2">the Mississippi the Mississippi River</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.270" end="01:25:54.180" style="s2">yeah our region or watershed which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.150" end="01:25:57.210" style="s2">massive if you think about what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.180" end="01:26:01.530" style="s2">done as an economic model in that bio</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.210" end="01:26:04.440" style="s2">region it&#39;s essentially extracting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.530" end="01:26:07.710" style="s2">it&#39;s an agricultural extraction economy</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.440" end="01:26:09.510" style="s2">yeah and it it has been transformed to</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.710" end="01:26:11.220" style="s2">industrial agriculture and I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.510" end="01:26:14.070" style="s2">generalizations here it&#39;s not totally</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.220" end="01:26:16.590" style="s2">true but broadly speaking that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.070" end="01:26:20.910" style="s2">breadbasket of the United States because</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.590" end="01:26:22.230" style="s2">that&#39;s where the the you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.910" end="01:26:26.270" style="s2">plains of the Mississippi River system</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.230" end="01:26:28.380" style="s2">are and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve you know by design</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.270" end="01:26:31.650" style="s2">converted that into industrial</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.380" end="01:26:33.360" style="s2">extractive agriculture and I have it</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.650" end="01:26:35.910" style="s2">when I give talks sometimes I have</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.360" end="01:26:38.220" style="s2">another map which shows the red state</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.910" end="01:26:42.930" style="s2">blue state split in the United States</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.220" end="01:26:46.350" style="s2">and and the red state the red states</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.930" end="01:26:49.080" style="s2">line up pretty pretty much not to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.350" end="01:26:52.320" style="s2">tee but pretty much up against the</p>

<p begin="01:26:52.320" end="01:26:59.040" style="s2">is it a surprise to us that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.800" end="01:27:01.200" style="s2">you know the red state which to me has</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.040" end="01:27:07.010" style="s2">nothing to do with conservativism and</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.200" end="01:27:10.159" style="s2">liberalism it has to do with desperation</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.010" end="01:27:12.500" style="s2">you know subsistence living under under</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.159" end="01:27:14.780" style="s2">a very extractive system that has gone</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.500" end="01:27:18.260" style="s2">all the profits have gone to a very few</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.780" end="01:27:22.369" style="s2">you know massive agricultural companies</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.260" end="01:27:25.550" style="s2">and destroyed communities and the</p>

<p begin="01:27:33.650" end="01:27:37.760" style="s2">this is what happens when you</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.239" end="01:27:42.170" style="s2">systematically turn a region a bio</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.760" end="01:27:43.639" style="s2">region into an extractive project now</p>

<p begin="01:27:43.639" end="01:27:49.030" style="s2">imagine if that entire bio region was</p>

<p begin="01:27:49.030" end="01:27:53.960" style="s2">that would mean that the ignoring that</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.590" end="01:27:56.300" style="s2">the Great Plains which are this massive</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.960" end="01:27:58.850" style="s2">carbon sink but have been converted to a</p>

<p begin="01:28:04.179" end="01:28:09.830" style="s2">sequestering carbon and and less floods</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.860" end="01:28:11.719" style="s2">and blah blah blah it would transform</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.830" end="01:28:13.219" style="s2">that entire region which wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.719" end="01:28:14.929" style="s2">transform the politics of the United</p>

<p begin="01:28:18.560" end="01:28:24.860" style="s2">I think the the the idea of rewilding in</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.980" end="01:28:26.659" style="s2">that area would also have a lot of power</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.860" end="01:28:28.730" style="s2">particularly like getting Ted Turner</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.659" end="01:28:32.590" style="s2">involved he&#39;s got a few PI&#39;s of spare</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.730" end="01:28:35.389" style="s2">and rewilding some of the Great Plains</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.590" end="01:28:37.969" style="s2">but you know people don&#39;t realize what</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.389" end="01:28:41.780" style="s2">we did to the Great Plains is as bad</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.969" end="01:28:44.449" style="s2">perhaps I&#39;m not an ecologist to judge</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.780" end="01:28:47.989" style="s2">but it&#39;s certainly of the comparable</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.449" end="01:28:50.060" style="s2">scale of badness as what we&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.989" end="01:28:51.280" style="s2">the Amazon right now hmm we&#39;re tearing</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.060" end="01:28:54.380" style="s2">down the Amazon to make room for</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.280" end="01:28:56.989" style="s2">industrial meat feedlot systems and</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.380" end="01:28:58.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve already ripped up the northern the</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.989" end="01:29:01.550" style="s2">great prairies which are these massive</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.880" end="01:29:04.010" style="s2">perennial carbon sinks and convert them</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.550" end="01:29:06.650" style="s2">to corn and soybeans to feed cattle hmm</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.010" end="01:29:08.330" style="s2">so what&#39;s the difference and why aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.650" end="01:29:09.920" style="s2">we up in arms about what we&#39;ve done in</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.330" end="01:29:11.840" style="s2">the Great Plains the way we&#39;re up in</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.920" end="01:29:14.750" style="s2">arms about burning down the Amazon we</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.840" end="01:29:17.119" style="s2">should be we should be well this has</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.750" end="01:29:18.450" style="s2">been super rich and I feel like we could</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.119" end="01:29:21.170" style="s2">easily continue</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.450" end="01:29:26.790" style="s2">for another hour and but I know that if</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.170" end="01:29:28.680" style="s2">we post a video that is 2 hours nobody</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.790" end="01:29:30.780" style="s2">will watch it and I won&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.680" end="01:29:33.390" style="s2">get into kind of editing it into nice</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.780" end="01:29:35.730" style="s2">bite-sized chunks as people like to feed</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.390" end="01:29:36.900" style="s2">on these days but this has been really</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.730" end="01:29:39.290" style="s2">nice and maybe we can do it again</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.900" end="01:29:41.730" style="s2">because there&#39;s just so much talk about</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.290" end="01:29:43.740" style="s2">we need to we need to come over to my</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.730" end="01:29:47.670" style="s2">Orca and set up a regenerative community</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.740" end="01:29:49.410" style="s2">there to join the network because I mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.670" end="01:29:51.150" style="s2">I&#39;m still very much working on that I</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.410" end="01:29:53.670" style="s2">just don&#39;t feel I mean I&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.150" end="01:29:55.770" style="s2">way I&#39;ve been working on that before the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.670" end="01:29:57.360" style="s2">capital Institute was around the time</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.770" end="01:29:59.130" style="s2">that since the capital Institute was</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.360" end="01:30:01.410" style="s2">formed and before the regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.130" end="01:30:03.270" style="s2">communities network was formed but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.410" end="01:30:05.940" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because just a couple</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.270" end="01:30:12.270" style="s2">of weeks ago I had a public talk here on</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.940" end="01:30:14.670" style="s2">my Orca where that the topic was the</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.270" end="01:30:17.040" style="s2">potential for Majorca to be an example</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.670" end="01:30:19.050" style="s2">of by regional regeneration and how</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.040" end="01:30:21.960" style="s2">islands are special cases within buyer</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.050" end="01:30:25.200" style="s2">angels because they even better defined</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.960" end="01:30:28.200" style="s2">boundaries and and that actually enables</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.200" end="01:30:30.540" style="s2">a lot and then of course Majorca is a</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.200" end="01:30:32.400" style="s2">sub case where the economy is so</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.540" end="01:30:35.460" style="s2">dependent on tourism that you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.400" end="01:30:38.190" style="s2">a sort of turning the problem into the</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.460" end="01:30:39.750" style="s2">solution I keep with the system if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.190" end="01:30:41.820" style="s2">want to change anything on my Yorker you</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.750" end="01:30:43.710" style="s2">have to also ask the question what would</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.820" end="01:30:46.830" style="s2">regenerative tourism look like how could</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.710" end="01:30:49.410" style="s2">tourism give back to a region but then</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.830" end="01:30:51.180" style="s2">suddenly that idea that it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.410" end="01:30:53.580" style="s2">nice to have a case study of this size</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.180" end="01:30:54.810" style="s2">and that has global significance but</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.580" end="01:30:58.290" style="s2">when you when you put it into the</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.810" end="01:31:01.590" style="s2">context using this as an exploration of</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.290" end="01:31:04.830" style="s2">how tourism big it can become the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.590" end="01:31:07.320" style="s2">flywheel the the motor for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.830" end="01:31:08.940" style="s2">transition not for the final output but</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.320" end="01:31:10.440" style="s2">really for the transition of re</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.940" end="01:31:11.940" style="s2">regionalised in production and</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.440" end="01:31:14.190" style="s2">consumption and building the healthier</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.940" end="01:31:18.780" style="s2">structures at the local scale and doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.190" end="01:31:20.670" style="s2">eco systems restoration work then M this</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.780" end="01:31:23.730" style="s2">little island suddenly could have global</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.670" end="01:31:25.620" style="s2">significance because M that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.730" end="01:31:28.740" style="s2">needed and so many paradises around the</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.620" end="01:31:32.130" style="s2">world and on top of it because Majorca</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.740" end="01:31:34.980" style="s2">once exported one level like one model</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.130" end="01:31:37.770" style="s2">of tourism all-inclusive mass tourism to</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.980" end="01:31:41.550" style="s2">the world and may York and Families</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.770" end="01:31:43.050" style="s2">owned five of the 20 largest tourism</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.550" end="01:31:45.090" style="s2">companies in the world that the</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.050" end="01:31:47.130" style="s2">family-owned businesses by my Yorkin</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.090" end="01:31:48.810" style="s2">that still have a patriarchal structure</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.130" end="01:31:51.000" style="s2">basically it&#39;s five guys you need to</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.810" end="01:31:54.090" style="s2">convince that you should do it again</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.000" end="01:31:55.770" style="s2">they should in their age export the new</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.090" end="01:31:58.140" style="s2">model of tourism called regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.770" end="01:32:01.650" style="s2">tourism to the world to redeem the sins</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.140" end="01:32:03.150" style="s2">of the first engine that they and that</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.650" end="01:32:05.640" style="s2">sort of that the narrative that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.150" end="01:32:08.820" style="s2">trying to seed and at this meeting two</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.640" end="01:32:10.530" style="s2">weeks ago we just realized that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.820" end="01:32:12.900" style="s2">so many pieces in the puzzle and so many</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.530" end="01:32:14.640" style="s2">players that like some of them before I</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.900" end="01:32:16.590" style="s2">even came to this island I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.640" end="01:32:19.530" style="s2">a lot of beautiful local leaders who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.590" end="01:32:21.900" style="s2">done amazing work already and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.530" end="01:32:24.390" style="s2">just teaming up with a with a filmmaker</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.900" end="01:32:26.820" style="s2">to begin to tell this story and make it</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.390" end="01:32:28.680" style="s2">visible to itself because I think that</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.820" end="01:32:31.860" style="s2">so much of the work that we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.680" end="01:32:34.410" style="s2">at this bar regional scale coming back</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.860" end="01:32:36.120" style="s2">to complexity like if you if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.410" end="01:32:37.970" style="s2">predict and control the system and you</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.120" end="01:32:40.190" style="s2">have to have the humility that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.970" end="01:32:42.900" style="s2">interacting with it in your own</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.190" end="01:32:45.950" style="s2">ignorance and in your own best</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.900" end="01:32:49.770" style="s2">intentions guided by the qualities like</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.950" end="01:32:54.450" style="s2">that you distilled and then then you can</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.770" end="01:32:56.580" style="s2">really understand that working with</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.450" end="01:32:59.670" style="s2">complexity and trying to merge your</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.580" end="01:33:01.740" style="s2">positive emergence is about who speaks</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.670" end="01:33:04.110" style="s2">to whom the relationship of that</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.740" end="01:33:05.910" style="s2">conversation the quality of that</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.110" end="01:33:08.220" style="s2">conversation so basically whose connect</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.910" end="01:33:09.800" style="s2">how&#39;s the system connected to itself the</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.220" end="01:33:13.650" style="s2">quality of the relationships and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.800" end="01:33:17.400" style="s2">quality of information flow yeah already</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.650" end="01:33:19.110" style="s2">it changes everything and after that</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.400" end="01:33:21.090" style="s2">then comes the quality that the</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.110" end="01:33:23.130" style="s2">financial flows and the resource flows</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.090" end="01:33:25.680" style="s2">and all that but but that&#39;s what we need</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.130" end="01:33:29.280" style="s2">to do it at both in the fractal of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.680" end="01:33:33.780" style="s2">bio region and then also by a region two</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.280" end="01:33:36.300" style="s2">by region as you just described is is</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.780" end="01:33:39.030" style="s2">very much the process</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.300" end="01:33:43.260" style="s2">that we you know we don&#39;t enforce it but</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.030" end="01:33:44.550" style="s2">there is a there is a you know a cycle</p>
