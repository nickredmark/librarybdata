<p begin="00:20:47.840" end="00:20:55.239" style="s2">will put the correct links in the note</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:57.950" style="s2">descriptions this is from Matt Boehner</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.239" end="00:20:59.509" style="s2">is it sensible to use the technique of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.950" end="00:21:01.369" style="s2">meditative questioning to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.509" end="00:21:03.590" style="s2">root of certain feelings or emotions I</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.369" end="00:21:09.259" style="s2">sometimes find it hard to place why I</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.590" end="00:21:10.850" style="s2">feel a certain way so it this isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.259" end="00:21:13.330" style="s2">is a tricky question to answer</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.850" end="00:21:16.609" style="s2">the meditative questioning is a good way</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.330" end="00:21:22.850" style="s2">to meditate into it try to see deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.609" end="00:21:24.019" style="s2">into why you&#39;re doing this what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.850" end="00:21:25.489" style="s2">is why you&#39;re doing a particular form of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.019" end="00:21:31.519" style="s2">behavior or experiencing a particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.489" end="00:21:34.220" style="s2">kind of emotion so it is a wise thing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.519" end="00:21:36.649" style="s2">do but there&#39;s there&#39;s a risk to it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.220" end="00:21:39.649" style="s2">I mentioned this last time when we turn</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.649" end="00:21:43.820" style="s2">this from the act of deepening the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.649" end="00:21:46.039" style="s2">process to a technique for producing a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.820" end="00:21:48.499" style="s2">particular price result a particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.039" end="00:21:51.950" style="s2">answer we are training our brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.499" end="00:21:53.779" style="s2">ultimately in the wrong way so I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.950" end="00:21:55.909" style="s2">recommend if you&#39;re going to do what</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.779" end="00:21:57.950" style="s2">you&#39;re suggesting that you set it aside</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.909" end="00:22:00.919" style="s2">at a different time from your regular</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.950" end="00:22:02.989" style="s2">practice in a different location and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.919" end="00:22:04.580" style="s2">do not make it a regular thing to use</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.989" end="00:22:07.070" style="s2">meditative questioning to get these</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.580" end="00:22:08.149" style="s2">kinds of differences so I wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.070" end="00:22:11.119" style="s2">don&#39;t ever do it</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.149" end="00:22:12.350" style="s2">but mark it off very clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.119" end="00:22:14.570" style="s2">explicitly two more</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.350" end="00:22:17.419" style="s2">processing parts of your brain that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.570" end="00:22:19.460" style="s2">is not the normal practice I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.419" end="00:22:22.280" style="s2">to do this regularly so that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.460" end="00:22:24.140" style="s2">get fused and that you lose what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.280" end="00:22:26.679" style="s2">meditative questioning is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.140" end="00:22:30.590" style="s2">doing for you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.679" end="00:22:33.470" style="s2">Calico image I&#39;m finding that as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.590" end="00:22:35.270" style="s2">weeks of practice have gone by if I may</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.470" end="00:22:37.070" style="s2">miss one day that I find an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.270" end="00:22:38.600" style="s2">rising of anxiousness is these too much</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.070" end="00:22:41.330" style="s2">of an attachment to the new meditative</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.600" end="00:22:47.320" style="s2">experience I don&#39;t know of attachments</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.330" end="00:22:52.580" style="s2">the right word and what what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.320" end="00:22:55.630" style="s2">and again you know it&#39;s difficult when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.580" end="00:22:58.549" style="s2">don&#39;t know a lot of you personally but</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.630" end="00:23:00.650" style="s2">generally what happens as you start</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.309" end="00:24:43.690" style="s2">three lines for ruining I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.159" end="00:24:47.710" style="s2">this is from Dennis I&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.690" end="00:24:50.259" style="s2">given an explanation so you&#39;re asking me</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.710" end="00:24:52.899" style="s2">to sort of offer a conjecture here I</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.259" end="00:24:54.789" style="s2">surmise that what&#39;s happening is we and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.899" end="00:24:56.889" style="s2">this has to do this comes from a more</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.789" end="00:25:00.340" style="s2">from car design we have an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.889" end="00:25:03.519" style="s2">existence in which we Orient and because</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.340" end="00:25:06.669" style="s2">we&#39;re bodied we have if we have in front</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.519" end="00:25:09.100" style="s2">of me behind me orientation and then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.669" end="00:25:11.169" style="s2">have a up and down orientation that runs</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.100" end="00:25:13.509" style="s2">right through our center of gravity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.169" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">therefore by doing those three lines</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.509" end="00:25:19.779" style="s2">we&#39;re massively engaging the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:23.649" style="s2">fundamental fields our embodiment sets</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.779" end="00:25:25.330" style="s2">out for us in perspective the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.649" end="00:25:28.990" style="s2">perspectives we have and the way we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.330" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">oriented in space so I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.990" end="00:25:34.570" style="s2">reason why the three lines probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:37.570" style="s2">evolved I have no evidence for this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.570" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">I&#39;m offering you a conjecture based on</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.570" end="00:25:41.649" style="s2">what I know from the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">embodiment that comes from what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.649" end="00:25:47.559" style="s2">for cognitive science under a fair how</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:49.960" style="s2">can i distinguish if I&#39;m in the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.559" end="00:25:51.639" style="s2">state meaning not following asleep but</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.960" end="00:25:53.409" style="s2">being the middle of the usual States</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.639" end="00:25:56.879" style="s2">today I have felt like falling asleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.409" end="00:26:03.399" style="s2">but not missing out on the counting etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.879" end="00:26:09.639" style="s2">so again you should feel quite alert in</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.399" end="00:26:14.590" style="s2">the practice what that means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.639" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">states here that sort of you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.590" end="00:26:19.330" style="s2">stable so you&#39;re not your mind isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:22.120" style="s2">rushing but there&#39;s a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.330" end="00:26:24.549" style="s2">there&#39;s an alertness there&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.120" end="00:26:27.580" style="s2">there&#39;s that empowering of vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.549" end="00:26:31.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of the mind becoming</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.580" end="00:26:33.549" style="s2">more engaged with reality as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.539" end="00:26:36.820" style="s2">when we&#39;re falling asleep where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.549" end="00:26:39.310" style="s2">losing alertness the the sense that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.820" end="00:26:41.830" style="s2">insight is imminent</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.310" end="00:26:45.010" style="s2">for us it&#39;s away we get a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.830" end="00:26:48.340" style="s2">contentedness things right the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.010" end="00:26:51.190" style="s2">growth and change is diminishing and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.340" end="00:26:53.470" style="s2">scope and engagement of the mind tends</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.190" end="00:26:56.830" style="s2">to also diminish and so that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.470" end="00:26:59.800" style="s2">can learn to try and track between</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.830" end="00:27:02.470" style="s2">falling asleep and what we&#39;re all trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.800" end="00:27:05.530" style="s2">to do the Buddha the awakened one and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.470" end="00:27:07.330" style="s2">wake up think about use that metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.530" end="00:27:09.490" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in your mind when</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.330" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;re waking up not not when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:15.700" style="s2">the rushing worry but that actual shift</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.990" end="00:27:17.530" style="s2">that felt change in consciousness as</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.700" end="00:27:19.450" style="s2">you&#39;re waking up you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.530" end="00:27:21.730" style="s2">initially dozy and then there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.450" end="00:27:24.370" style="s2">brightening the opening the engagement</p>
