<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">albeit from a different perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">american liberalism is at risk</p>

<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">take a moment to understand america as</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">the overwhelming majority of its jews</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">believed it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">and perhaps as we always assumed it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">would be it was liberal</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">not liberal in the narrow partisan sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">but liberal in the most capacious and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">distinctly american sense of that word</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">the belief that everyone is equal</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">because everyone is created in the image</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">of god</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">the belief in the sacredness of the</p>

<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">the belief that the rule of law and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">equality under that law is the</p>

<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">the belief that due process and the</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">that mob violence is bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">the belief that pluralism is a source of</p>

<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">and that liberty of thought faith and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">speech are the bedrocks of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">the liberal worldview was one that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">recognized that there were things indeed</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">the most important things in life that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">were located outside of the realm of</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.319" style="s2">close friends</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">because as scalia once said some things</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">are more important than votes</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">crucially this liberalism relied on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">view that the enlightenment tools of</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:03:59.840" style="s2">racism was evil because it contradicted</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">since it judged people not based on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">content of their character but on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">color of their skin</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">and while america&#39;s founders were guilty</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">of undeniable hypocrisy their own moral</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">failings did not invalidate their</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">as martin luther king jr put it because</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">they were quote</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">a promissory note to which every</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">american was to fall air</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">in other words the founders themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">planted the seeds of slavery&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">and our second founding fathers</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">made it so america would never be</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">perfect but we could always strive</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">toward building a more perfect union</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">i didn&#39;t even know that this worldview</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">had a name because it was baked into</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">barry wise the confusion and there seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:40.639" style="s2">to be a good deal of it these days is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:41.759" style="s2">among american jews</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.479" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">i share that first not merely because it</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">as we have come to expect from barry</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">insightful and incisive in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">ideas but also beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">and careful writing but also because</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">you might imagine if you had fallen prey</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">to the modern ideology</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">that someone like barry who was raised</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">who was raised not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">secularly right that she is she is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">jewish and she is proud of her</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">judaism and rod drear who</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">is unapologetically christian and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">the subtitle of his book</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">lived not by lies is a manual for</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">christian dissidents</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">that barry and rod might not have much</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">but of course they do and we do uh and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:42.319" style="s2">uh drear has uh referred to uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">not just the two of us brett um but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.319" end="00:06:46.560" style="s2">barry weiss and james lindsay</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">as the secular liberals uh with whom he</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">allyship and this is a kind of allyship</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">um that is honorable and real and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">particularly right now so</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">uh i want to place this in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">of context maybe a couple different</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:03.280" style="s2">kinds of context first of all i should</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">say the essay</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.280" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">is excellent and well worth a complete</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">it is very much from a jewish</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">and i want to point out why this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">so resonant so barry&#39;s thesis</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">in her most recent book is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">that when the center doesn&#39;t hold it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">collapses on jews that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:28.560" style="s2">many of the atrocities that history has</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">seen and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.560" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">um so in effect she is raising the alarm</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">that the center is collapsing and we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">talk and we have talked over the last</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:42.319" style="s2">50 episodes and elsewhere about</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">why the center is collapsing in effect</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.319" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">it is being punished out of existence by</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">fringes on both sides but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:52.879" style="s2">the recognition that there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">um a kind of paralysis which i must say</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.879" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">i am seeing also in</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">many of the sort of private discussions</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">that we are party to these days where</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">there&#39;s so much to be seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">in the breaking apart of this agreement</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">in the center and i don&#39;t mean centrism</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">but this agreement about the basic</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">that we should collectively defend</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">that there is a temptation to simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">catalogue and marvel and gawk at</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">all of the various examples of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">going wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.160" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">rather than to well maybe i shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">say that people</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">do extrapolate to what this means about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">where we are headed collectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">but there is no agreement about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">the details of that are like liable to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">look like and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">what we ought to do about it so we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">people fleeing cities for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">but there&#39;s no consensus about how much</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">of this remains abstract how much this</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">could turn into uh you know an atrocity</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">on our own shores and this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">i find you know that we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">um three of the things that i pulled</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">drier&#39;s book um that we have talked</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">about separately but that he really puts</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">um front and center that are ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">um that those of us who are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">dissident christians</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">or uh jews watching the center collapse</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">or secular liberals or you know some</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">combination</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">of of those or or outside of any of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">those groups and yet watching this</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">this what dreer calls a soft</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">totalitarianism or</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">therapeutic totalitarianism that we need</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">to return</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">to some principles that we will talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">about here of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:37.920" style="s2">the value of family the value of privacy</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">and the value of community and how is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.920" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">uh recover and um and reinvigorate our</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">our own selves above and beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">level of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">to return ourselves to family privacy</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">uh community right and so um</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.040" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">the orientation to those things which</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">strike people in some ways as</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">conservative isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">is also an indicator of the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">the alliance which i think once you spot</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">it is all</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very intuitive right</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">between for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">christians and jews now i hope</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">we will not forget at some point to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">the visible alliance that is emerging</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">here if it&#39;s even an alliance if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">even the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">terminology for it and place it in an</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">evolutionary context because i do think</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">there&#39;s something important to be said</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">about whether or not uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">obviously jews and christians</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:39.200" style="s2">are distinct on the other hand judeo</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">is something and so putting that in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">evolutionary context probably makes a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:46.959" style="s2">lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">just just at its most at the simplest</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.959" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">christianity emerges from judaism right</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">um you know if you apply the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:58.399" style="s2">phylogenetic systematics</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">in a place where admittedly not all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.399" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">the assumptions are perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">met but they&#39;re met well enough that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">can justify it at least at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">a very strong analogy it would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">like a large clade of creatures emerging</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:16.959" style="s2">from a comparatively small clade of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">creatures which of course is something</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.959" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">that happened</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">many times in history so christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">in some sense a form of judaism</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:26.880" style="s2">and protestantism is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">christianity and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">um but then there is also this other</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">fact which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">that many of the belief structures</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">that are innovated in christianity have</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">moved culturally into judaism and so in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">some sense christians are</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">phylogenetically</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">jewish and jews are memetically</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">christians</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">which is you know once once you spot the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">implications of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">the whole thing makes a lot more sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">yeah and so the secular liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">uh so named by dreher which we will</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">return to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">uh is um in some ways formalized it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">formalized across many</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">uh many faiths um but um</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">we in the west i think are most familiar</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">with it in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">and it has become all of our birthrights</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">right it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">um it is as as barry weiss writes in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">essay from which i read and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">as dreer writes uh uh in this book</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">uh something that uh that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">we are all born to and most of us i</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">think have</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">expected would continue um and so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">know drear is sounding the alarm saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">people who actually lived under</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">totalitarian regimes</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">which is you know to say in eastern</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">europe mostly not very long ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">are seeing what is happening in the west</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">and saying no this doesn&#39;t look exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">like history</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">but yes there are too many things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">such that anyone who is not concerned</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">right now is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">blind either willfully or not so i i</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">think it does warrant saying as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">since we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">the the sort of phylogenetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">relationship between christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">judaism</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">and the cultural effectively the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">cultural borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">of some of the so-called liberal ideals</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">from the teachings of jesus by um the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">vast majority of people who call</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">themselves secular liberals which</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">includes</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">um i think a you know a majority of jews</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">at least in america</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">um that you and i to some degree come</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">from these two different traditions as</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">right that you well maybe you you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:37.440" style="s2">speak in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">you know a couple of sentences about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.440" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">home that you were raised in but i was</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">raised</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">mostly without religion um but my father</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:49.279" style="s2">lapsed catholic who um</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">not as it turns out on his deathbed but</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.279" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">at one point when we thought he might</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">um not come out of open-heart surgery</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">did ask actually to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">a priest and and talk to him which um</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">which as far as we know he hadn&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">you know decades and so he a man of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">science a man of reason a man who prized</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">enlightenment values</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">was in some ways a man of faith as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">and although</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">he took me into a church i believe once</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">and only once to see the midnight mass</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">one christmas eve</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">um and so you know never never took</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">to me the faith that he was raised with</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.440" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">on a you know on a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">on a farm in northeastern iowa in the in</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">the 40s and 50s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">it was part of part of how he was um how</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">he informed his own view and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">and my mother also emerges from a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">christian tradition although had</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:41.279" style="s2">had no um was not raised with any faith</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">herself and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:44.399" style="s2">they did not raise me with any and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.399" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">my part i was raised in a home that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:49.920" style="s2">decidedly</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">secular both my parents are jewish but</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.920" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">um it was you know there was ceremonial</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">observance but</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">uh nothing based on uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">faith i would say and that went back</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">you know a couple generations on my</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">mom&#39;s side um</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">was in a jewish home that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">observant and kept kosher and i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">believing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">and so anyway i got exposure to it that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">among others um so anyway i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.079" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">before you go on um i don&#39;t there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">many places</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:28.959" style="s2">that we could go today and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">that i do want to get to and we may just</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">but one of the things i started doing in</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:53.320" style="s2">resisting the the ideology the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">what many of us are seeing as a creeping</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.320" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">totalitarianism and</p>

<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">different experiences</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">and as an ideology shows</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">following you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">might send me down a path that could</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">turn me into one</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">so i want to connect a couple things up</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:51.200" style="s2">here yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">there&#39;s something interesting in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.200" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">fact that even now i couldn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">um whether or not the family that i had</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">so much contact with growing up</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">was had any faith in the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">i assumed there was some but there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">something to be said</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">for on the jewish side of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">it is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">frequent for jews to have a personal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">and i think complex relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">of faith that can go up through</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">having no faith in the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">whatsoever and still being</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">observant and so um over</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">time i&#39;ve come to understand you know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:36.480" style="s2">we take barry&#39;s perspective for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">that the center has to hold in order for</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.480" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">jews to have a place in most societies</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">um that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">an anti-fragility to jews because</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">frankly they&#39;ve faced so many of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">different catastrophes</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">and i would say as an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">biologist it&#39;s a little bit surprising</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">that um we haven&#39;t gone extinct right</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">and that it has to do with certain kinds</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">um wisdom about how to endure these</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">things often not very well but simply to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">persist through an era in which the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">center has not held and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">one of the things you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">christian side it&#39;s very frequent that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">as people lose their faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">they also lose their tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">so one of the things that i think may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">to be learned from the jewish side is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">that there&#39;s a reason not to do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">even at the point that something</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">challenges</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">faith that there is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">chesterton&#39;s fence</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">all over the place there are all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">these protective traditions that may not</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">be straightforward in the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">protect in other words you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.440" style="s2">metaphorical truths may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">offering some kind of immunity and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">speak actually we invoke</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">in in the book that we are writing</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">chesterton&#39;s gods</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">you know abandon them at your peril how</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">do you know what all they are doing for</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">you and you know we say this is people</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">without faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">yep um so um</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">i think we are seeing and uh drear</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">you know is pointing to it and barry</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">is in her own way pointing to it as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">that it is not at all surprising that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">you know if it&#39;s on the christian side</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s almost exclusively people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">have retained the kind of faith because</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">they&#39;ve also retained the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">put a break on um runaway liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">ambitious liberalism i think ambition</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">ambitious liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">created the west but runaway liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">is very dangerous and we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">it drive societies into the ground</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">before so there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">whether that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">but to see people come from religious</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">traditions of different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">and begin to sound the alarm from</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">different places and create</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">alliances is um it&#39;s at least hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">yeah no i i think it is exactly that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">that hope is part of why i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">start with</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">with barry weiss&#39;s essay before moving</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">into uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">uh a more expensive extensive discussion</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">the website i think you should just</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">declare a kind of narrow post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">surrounding pronunciation</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">to conceal himself from the nazis he</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">assumed his slovak mother&#39;s name</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.400" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2">and the liberal democratic west</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">though father kolakovic worried about</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.960" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">the threats to christian life and</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">he was far more concerned about the</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">saw as an imperialistic ideology</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">by the time by the time father kolokovic</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">reached baraslava it was clear that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">red army would defeat the germans in the</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">in fact in 1944 the czech government in</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">refused to accept the nominally</p>

<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">because he knew how the soviets thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">father kolokovic knew this was a lie</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">he warned slovak catholics that when the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">war ended czechoslovakia would fall to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">the rule of a soviet puppet government</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">he dedicated himself to preparing them</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">for persecution</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">drier then tells the story of how he um</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">father kolakovic truly did create a</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">small communities um who</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">created among other things sam is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">you know dissident literature published</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">on tiny presses that were hidden from</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">the authorities</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">and um and thus kept not just faith</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">alive but truth and an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">underlining lying realities and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">love and beauty as well and um</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">one reason i wanted to share just that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">just that little bit from the book</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">um is to point out that um this is a man</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:42.480" style="s2">klockovic who was an anti-fascist in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that was the original</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.480" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">meaning of the term if that was when the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">idea was was first formulated i think it</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">was but i&#39;m not totally sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">um but contrast that with the people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">are now calling themselves anti-fascists</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same descent it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">resistance and we&#39;re going to get to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:08.000" style="s2">um why i think um why we think</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:10.159" style="s2">some of the confusion exists but</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.000" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">you know please we&#39;ve heard from some</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.159" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">really actually i think are legitimately</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">confused because</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">the resistance at the moment has named</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">itself antifa</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s not the only part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">resistance that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">in the streets and rioting and such</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">but being able to name yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">something that aligns with an</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:33.279" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">uh important and uplifting and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">truth-seeking group</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">does not make you that thing and yet</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">people are being fooled</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">yeah i think you know it occurs to me in</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:46.799" style="s2">this moment i hope this works</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">that the tell with respect to antifa</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.799" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">is that it is anarchist right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">about anti-fascism in the literal sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">that should travel with anarchism right</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">in fact i would argue this is in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">effect a non-sequitur</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:07.080" style="s2">right and that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">anarchism has put on the cloak of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.080" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">anti-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">in order that it can engage in</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:15.760" style="s2">and get away with it is not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">you you need to have some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">defense and in fact uh anarchism</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">was a knit fringe</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">idea that always lurked at some you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">tiny insignificant level in the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">northwest and then it suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">uh took up anti-racism and anti-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">as those things</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">uh became fashionable um okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious what the ploy is and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">have an obligation not to listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:49.279" style="s2">right yes we do yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">is that yeah that&#39;s effectively yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.279" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">yeah we we we absolutely do and i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">you know that wraps into</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:58.080" style="s2">um drier&#39;s framing of i&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">mentioned a soft totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">or also a therapeutic totalitarianism in</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">uh in his language hatred of dissenters</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">from this utopian ideology</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.400" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">comes in the guise of helping and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">healing how could you resist us we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">just trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">or how could you resist us what we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">doing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:19.120" style="s2">fighting a history of oppression and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">therefore if you resist</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.120" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">us you approve of the oppression and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">yourself are an oppression</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">an oppressor um it&#39;s a not even very</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">clever sophisticated sleight of hand</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">sort of linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">um trick and yet uh yet many are fooled</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">in part because</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:37.840" style="s2">um being called racist or sexist or any</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">of the things that people are now being</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.840" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">called with</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">with wild abandon is</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">feels like such a terrible fate</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">that people who have not yet unjustly</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">been called those things</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">cannot imagine how they could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">survive being on the other side of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">and yet um and yet you do and if it if</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">you simply know</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">yourself and have good people around you</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">enough to know that those slurs are not</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:12.240" style="s2">um that you have upon being called these</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">things i believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s you know i think the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">is pretty clear which is you are raised</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">if we grant liberalism the full breadth</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">of the honorable</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.240" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">version you are raised to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">bigotry</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">that you have overcome right sexism is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">racism is bad fascism is bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">but the problem is that these terms are</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">inherently</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">perfectly elastic that is to say they</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">can be stretched</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">right down to the border of what can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">measured you can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">zero and in fact we see this in candy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">absurd definition</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">of anti-racism is that it rules out that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:57.120" style="s2">there&#39;s any gap</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">you know where you can just simply be</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.120" end="00:29:00.640" style="s2">non-racist you&#39;re either racist</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">or you&#39;re fully active on this other</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.640" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">side so you know it has been stretched</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">to the point that um the mind that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">understands i i do not want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">racist</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">is then sort of susceptible to this</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">command oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">here&#39;s how you avoid being a racist you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">become an anti-racist what&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">anti-racist well here&#39;s a list of things</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">you would have to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:22.399" style="s2">right yes so yes that elastas that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">elastic nature of the definitions</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.399" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">you know is of course a kafka trap as as</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve mentioned i do want to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">this term soft totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">i have a feeling that we are about to at</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:38.760" style="s2">societal level end up in</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">a discussion over whether or not this</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.760" end="00:29:44.159" style="s2">totalitarianism that we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">is soft whether it is just early</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.159" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">whether we are headed down some</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">different road than we&#39;ve seen clearly</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">some of the details are different</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">well i think part of part of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">is it is not um state driven</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">and so um it comes in</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">looking quite different and it comes in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">looking like</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:07.120" style="s2">the exhortations of your colleagues at</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.120" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">or your children&#39;s teachers</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">or just neighbors and of course we know</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">history that some of the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">totalitarian regimes have used the young</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">and have used uh the ability to turn</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">people against their own family members</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">um against um against entire societies</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">and certainly against um</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">against dissenters um but that this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">is happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">at least at this point absent um</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">anything emerging from the state in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">you know there there are there are many</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">in you know and you know everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">that they exist but you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">many among</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">um acquaintances and and friends of ours</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">even who</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">do think that fascism is coming and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s trump</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">right that that&#39;s that that is the big</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">threat to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">democracy and the republic at this point</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">um it is it is certainly true that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">are no</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">fan of of the way that trump took</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">power and the kinds of ways that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">played people off one another</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">that were indeed destructive of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">relationship and discourse</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">uh and and you know and for the most</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">part um you know we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">we&#39;re not republicans and so mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with um</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">what his stated policies are although</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">there have been exceptions as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">um on this podcast um but</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">a we are on the left and so critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">our own</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">is one of the things that we think is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">critical</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">but also it is true that um</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">we see the threat that is emerging</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">on and you know really depending on how</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">you count emerging or decades old now</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">well coming to fever pitch now</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">um on university campuses in corporate</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">boardrooms in cubicles in the media</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">in the arts you know across every domain</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:05.039" style="s2">that you can imagine um that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">nominally on the left as a bigger threat</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.039" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">to democracy and the republic</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">than you know frankly a few well-armed</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">kooks on the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:19.720" style="s2">all right so i still want to delve</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">further here because the idea that soft</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.720" end="00:32:25.000" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:26.240" style="s2">might be defined by non-state</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.000" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">i believe there&#39;s something important</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">about this on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">i can&#39;t look away from</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">the fact that i regard the state as</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">feeble and parasitized the corruption</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">of the american governmental structure</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">is one</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">in which corporate forces</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">effectively took it over so it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">governing force what governs our lives</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">is whether or not you know twitter finds</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">so abhorrent that it&#39;s going to shut it</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">down so</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">in some sense if you came at this as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">biologist or an anthropologist and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">governance is that which governs right</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">rather than governance is the thing with</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">the buildings that have the columns</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">right if governance is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">governs</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">then governance has changed and this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">moving through the governance structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">right um and so to uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">to play devil&#39;s advocate here for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:31.679" style="s2">moment uh i could see people arguing</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">that you are changing the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">governance just as the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">racism sexism and fascism has been</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">changed by</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.159" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">people on the other side well i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">not to and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">as you know i don&#39;t i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">think that critique is fair but i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">to hear you defend</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">i mean let&#39;s put it this way i&#39;m sorting</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:49.039" style="s2">it out in real time so</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">uh i want to know that i&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">that also yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:54.559" style="s2">but you i think you said governance</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.320" end="00:36:53.839" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">ultimately is there anything inherently</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">is it early in the trajectory and will</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.160" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">we laugh at the term</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">soft totalitarianism five years from now</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">when we&#39;ve seen where it actually goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">well i don&#39;t i mean i don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:10.880" style="s2">term is meant to imply that it&#39;s nicer</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:12.560" style="s2">uh it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not and enforced</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.880" end="00:37:14.000" style="s2">with the backing of military and like i</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.560" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">just made that up at the moment but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.800" style="s2">it&#39;s different and this is one way of of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">describing the difference</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.800" end="00:37:21.839" style="s2">um and i do find that uh his</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">characterization drier&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.839" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">characterization of it as a therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">totalitarianism is actually even more</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:31.160" style="s2">apt so he says um i i said already</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">um that he describes therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.160" end="00:37:35.839" style="s2">totalitarianism as</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">um hatred of dissenters from this</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.839" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">utopian ideology that comes in the guise</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">of helping and healing</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">right um but he&#39;s he specifically argues</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">therapy that the therapeutic mode is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">sort of post-modern mode of existence</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">which i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">is apt and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">again this is written as a book quote</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">unquote for christian dissidents</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">and so he talks about religious man</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">giving way to psychological man</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">religious man in his definition</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">is living according to a belief in</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">transcendent principles that order human</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">life around communal purposes</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">right and psychological man believes</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no transcendent order and life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">purpose is defined one&#39;s way</p>

<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">and there&#39;s a way in which if you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">took that out of context entirely and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">said okay psychological man there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:24.480" style="s2">transcendent order and life&#39;s purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">to find one&#39;s way experimentally</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.480" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">that sounds a lot like um something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">we believe</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">that you and i believe as people without</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">and um who do understand evolution to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">um the current forms of life on earth</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">however the description of religious man</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:48.160" style="s2">um if you if you read it metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">is also something that we hold very very</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.160" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">dear</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">which is that according if i just take</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">um transcendent for the moment lives</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">as modernity has increasingly valued the</p>

<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">um you know get a draw terrible hand and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">are born into terrible families from</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">which they must escape and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">have no option</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">to be part of a family um that is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">is wonderful and loving but most of us</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">aren&#39;t in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">and the idea that we can and indeed that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">we must overthrow family</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">as a constraint that it is from the past</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">and we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">interested only in moving forward and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">finding new ways that are filled with</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s not just delusional but</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">it&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.359" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">so um and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2">let me just share a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">before you before you riff again because</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.640" end="00:40:29.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve gotten through very little of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">so far um</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">in communist russia drier reports um</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">parents were choosing to avoid what he</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.960" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">calls contamination</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">the humanities by encouraging children</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">this sounds a little bit like what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">going on with critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">and intersectionality in the modern</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">except of course in modernity in modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">times we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">uh this ideology has has marched right</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">into the natural sciences has declared</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">that uh male and female are</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">social constructs and don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">differ at all and um you know even even</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">the natural sciences aren&#39;t safe</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">not even it&#39;s not even limited to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">natural sciences even math</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">right even even math even math um so</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">um so it&#39;s in some ways we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">even farther than uh what was being seen</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">in totalitarian communist russia</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">um the he drier was told by some of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.680" style="s2">people he was interviewing that you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">essays must conform to a communist point</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">of view</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">well that sounds familiar doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s been in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">uh high school or college or knows</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">in the last uh 10 years knows very well</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:48.560" style="s2">that in some classes</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">in some fields there is one and only one</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.560" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">uh perspective that you are allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">take all this talk of multiple lenses</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">that the supposedly you know liberal</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">perspective allows</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">well only up to a point only if uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">you know only if you&#39;re writing about</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">something that you yourself may have</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">experienced but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">the conclusions that you come to uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">really in many fields there&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:14.319" style="s2">conclusion you&#39;re allowed to come to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">yeah um so this raises a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.319" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">different points and i i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know where all you&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:23.040" style="s2">but i do think</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">a we have to understand something i now</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.040" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">the this talk of communism and where we</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">are with respect to this new</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">trajectory and i cannot help there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">part of me that hears it the way i would</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">have heard it at 18.</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">right and to hear and share i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">think i know i knew you at 18. yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">would you afford it at 18. i would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:48.800" style="s2">heard it as</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">uh um a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.800" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">breathless fearful uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">over hyping of concerns that were really</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:43:02.000" style="s2">scary remote right um and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">i think the thing is now um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">beginning to understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">i do think that what we heard earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">our lives</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">was very overblown and of course a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">harm was done fighting communism in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">u.s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">right people who weren&#39;t communists or</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">people who were sort of nominally</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">interested in communism but hadn&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">anything wrong were</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">obviously punished formally and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.359" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">informally but</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">but that said i now think i</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">appreciate something about why</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">communism causes people to lose their</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">minds</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">especially people who&#39;ve seen what it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">does right and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">we have heard many people say that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:45.359" style="s2">know communism always ends in</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">starvation and gulags and i&#39;ve begun to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.359" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">wonder if in fact it starts with them</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">ends with them and if the reason isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:55.119" style="s2">pretty obvious from our own</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">discipline okay so let me just interject</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.119" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">one thing here that happens to be in my</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">in my notes here that um</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">totalitarians exert a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">of effort to control the common</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">and you know a point to which we have we</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">have spoken before and will speak</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">a lot again that we need we need strong</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">true amazing narratives that we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">point to that can become our myths</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">upon which with which we can build an an</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">excellent world that is it is fair for</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.560" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">um but mulan kundera specifically</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">has spoken to the danger of forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">one&#39;s past which i think is is a is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:31.680" style="s2">big part of what we&#39;re experiencing here</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">is that almost no one knows history no</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">no one including our generation really</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">was taught history well</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">uh and um drear paraphrase in kundera</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">says nobody defends gulags today</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">but the world remains full of suckers</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:47.359" style="s2">for the false utopian promises</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">that bring gulags into existence right</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">and people are erasing it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">just forgetting right so kundera deals</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">very well with the issue of forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">and actually erasing there&#39;s a vivid uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">image that has a member uh who has</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">behaved badly</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">physically erased from a painting i</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">believe or you know painted over</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">but in any case um the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">there are a number of important things</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.319" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">one i believe that it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:19.040" style="s2">simply the failure of group selection</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">that forces totalitarians especially of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.040" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">a communist</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:27.839" style="s2">ilk to engage in this totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">overreach in other words to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">that people have any freedom at all um</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">communism is not game theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">stable therefore the way you would</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">stabilize it or attempt to stabilize it</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">penalizing people who act on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">of reasonable incentives right you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">to reschedule</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">their incentives so that they behave you</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:49.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">uh for the same reason that a prisoner</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">or a slave behaves because the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">punishment for not behaving is so great</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">um so anyway that hazard is is very</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">large now</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">i want to return to something else that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">you said though you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">whether people need to believe something</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">larger and i&#39;ve heard a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">talk about this maybe most recently</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">douglas murray who is i believe a</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">non-believer</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:16.400" style="s2">but who regards religion as essential</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">because of effectively what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.400" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">people don&#39;t have something larger than</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">themselves to believe in and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:23.760" style="s2">if this is all right what you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">and what douglas has said is correct</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.760" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">but it if it is also correct that people</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">like you and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">and i um get along without</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">a belief in a supernatural higher order</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">right that there is something that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">have supplanted then this raises the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:44.400" style="s2">of is there so i have the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">you remove the belief in a higher power</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">right and it takes the safety off the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">gun but it doesn&#39;t fire the gun</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">right so the gun becomes dangerous at</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">the point that you don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">higher order you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">fall into one of these false ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">and you can end up doing horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">um because it basically slots in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">where you know a belief in something</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">larger would go</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way so</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:15.359" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if we might</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.119" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">actually just tell the story of dining</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.359" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">with a malagasy family</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">in southern madagascar a judge</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">and her family many years ago would have</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:27.920" style="s2">been 1993 our first trip to madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">um you know you know the story oh sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">of course yeah do you want to tell it or</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">i&#39;m sure this is always a danger when</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">the story is that old how much will we</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">will we agree on exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">but okay let me let me just set up that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">we had been traveling</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">across the southern half of madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">for in my rendering in the book that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">uh six years that we&#39;ve been traveling</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">six years yes it was we traveled 670</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">kilometers if</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:56.319" style="s2">if memory serves and it took 67 hours to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">travel so we were going at a rocking</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.319" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">speed of about 10 kilometers an hour</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">which is about six miles an hour four</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">weeks endless</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.440" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">endless endless in the back of a truck</p>

<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">is a common mode of transportation</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">suspended from the roof by a wire that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">swung back and forth all</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">night that they wouldn&#39;t even turn off</p>

<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">this kind of uh inability to know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">to do with what had just been</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">said and there was they became worried</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">about us well i don&#39;t think they did but</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">they voiced concern about well okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">if we take you at your word and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.119" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">really don&#39;t believe anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.960" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">then what prevents you from doing x y z</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:35.359" style="s2">how is it that you live good lives how</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">is it that you will continue to live</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">good lives right which turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">better question than you would think</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrific question yeah um and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">so the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">something you know i i think the answer</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:48.160" style="s2">in our case at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">if we can use our own minds as a place</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.160" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">some access i believe what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">is we have figured out what higher</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">could be constructed from a secular</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">foundation</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">in other words i don&#39;t think most people</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">can handle</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">the um the existential of existentialism</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:11.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">a lack of higher external purpose</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.359" end="00:52:15.520" style="s2">but for those who can get through that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">part you know in one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.520" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">there are things that you can pursue as</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">if they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">ultimate and they may not be um but it</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to drive you crazy</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">but that said i you know i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">real question is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">is there i&#39;m i shudder every time</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">somebody makes the claim that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">have religion or else people go crazy</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">and do terrible things because if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">then we&#39;re stuck in a very bad bind</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">which is that we are not</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">um we are not getting any less</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.800" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">capable of understanding what the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">universe is made of which means that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">necessity of god to the explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">what we are and how we got here and what</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">it means</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">is um ever more remote so</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">are we just going to continue to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">crazy till we destroy ourselves or</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">can people actually get over the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">and come up with things that work as</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.000" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:13.520" style="s2">or better well and you know and so in</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">drears book i don&#39;t think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.520" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">really an invocation of of god per se</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">there is certainly invocation of faith</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">and belief</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">but mostly it is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">way of organizing your life in line</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:33.280" style="s2">with principles that have been honorable</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">and served truth and and justice and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.280" end="00:53:37.680" style="s2">beauty in the past and we see no reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">to think that they have stopped doing so</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.680" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">if you if you and your family</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">and the community with whom you choose</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">to interact um are all also abiding by</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">similar principles</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">and so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.000" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">primarily about</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">um is there god it is it is about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">all of the other traditions that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">religion is based on right so if i can</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.040" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:03.440" style="s2">uh what i think is a fair</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">characterization of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.440" end="00:54:06.720" style="s2">at least the jewish diaspora and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">actually i would think</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">most of israeli society too um there</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:17.280" style="s2">is something that occurs where</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">religion is practiced and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.280" end="00:54:20.720" style="s2">is all that interested in getting you to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:23.359" style="s2">unpack</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.720" end="00:54:24.640" style="s2">your level of belief right the point is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.359" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">do you behave</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.640" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">actually it matches very well what i</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">heard uh jordan peterson once say which</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:32.400" style="s2">got him</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">in lots of trouble in certain quarters i</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.400" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">think it was actually during the debates</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:38.559" style="s2">in vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">where um he was asked if he believed</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.559" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">in a supernatural god and he said</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">uh i behave as if i do right which i</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">made perfect sense to me what he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">saying but</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">was taken by some to indicate a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">hypocrisy or</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">vagueness or something like that but i</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2">guess the question is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">if it was true that jews were</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:01.680" style="s2">anti-fragile because of all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">that happens every time</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.680" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">the center collapses and that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">things that you do is you teach people</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">how not to shed their traditions because</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">those traditions are serving</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.640" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">unstated goals one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.559" style="s2">might do</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">is provide a kind of don&#39;t ask don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.559" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">tell</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">over faith and you know that does seem</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">to be the nature of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">right people have complex relationships</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s very hard to know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">they believe nor does it matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">um okay so many places to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">here uh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:40.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve already talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">freedom being responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.640" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">responsibility for and towards rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">than responsibility from</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">and um uh drier argues that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2">um too often the secular liberal ideal</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">of freedom in the west is about</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">freedom from things as opposed to uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">being bringing with it a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">for and towards</p>

<p begin="01:00:48.319" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">organizing principle we would argue</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.480" end="01:00:56.079" style="s2">for what it is we are to do family</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">is the limits of lineage that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.079" end="01:00:59.760" style="s2">actually have contact with</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.839" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">that can be extended family and in some</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.760" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">cultures it can be very extended</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">it can then be you know modernity can</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:09.920" style="s2">wreck extended family and it can reduce</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:12.079" style="s2">family to the nuclear version</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.920" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">the family in question is in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.079" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">the christian version because the old</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">testament is not a monogamous document</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">the new testament is</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">and so in some sense we have been handed</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:26.079" style="s2">a version of family that has been</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">altered by modernity altered by</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.079" end="01:01:29.680" style="s2">somewhat ancient belief structures but</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">is stable</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.680" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">for evolutionary reasons what stabilizes</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">it metaphorical beliefs about a higher</p>

<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">this is exactly what i&#39;m saying is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">to behave as if those</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:58.799" style="s2">are permanent connections</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">is a literal understanding of something</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">in any case the point is when somebody</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:10.480" style="s2">sits down with pen and paper and says i</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:12.160" style="s2">have a better way</p>

<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:21.520" style="s2">right what they are in effect doing is</p>

<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re advocating at the</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">describe is the key thing that is being</p>

<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">in any case we have to figure out how to</p>

<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:26.960" style="s2">without um i think resorting to a</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">by one sophie lewis who argues what</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.839" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">really matters to me is the abolishment</p>

<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:50.240" style="s2">useful in actually dealing with the</p>

<p begin="01:05:50.240" end="01:05:53.599" style="s2">that has ensued um this should have been</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.599" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a piece i&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:05:59.039" style="s2">gonna link to all of these but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">piece published in commune at the very</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.039" end="01:06:02.079" style="s2">end of last year</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">called six steps to abolish the family</p>

<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:07.359" style="s2">all over the place in the modern</p>

<p begin="01:06:07.359" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">um so benda</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.559" end="01:06:15.440" style="s2">further argues in this essay quote in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:17.440" style="s2">society of atomized individuals</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:19.039" style="s2">as communist czechoslovakia was it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.440" end="01:06:20.400" style="s2">important for ordinary people to come</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.039" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">together and to be reminded of one</p>

<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:30.559" style="s2">so that speaks to the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.599" end="01:06:32.160" style="s2">community that goes beyond family but</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.559" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">before we</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">um before we i guess before we move over</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:36.799" style="s2">into talking about community a little</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:40.720" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.799" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">uh let me say a couple more things</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.720" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">about um how</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">how believing in your family and</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.559" end="01:06:51.039" style="s2">trusting your family</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:52.559" style="s2">has been useful so we must actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.039" end="01:06:55.440" style="s2">trust our children and tell them the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.559" end="01:06:57.200" style="s2">truth and much about modern parenting</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.440" end="01:06:58.839" style="s2">suggests doing exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.200" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">protecting them from all things that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.839" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">difficult and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:04.400" style="s2">lying to them when it seems easier or</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:06.720" style="s2">won&#39;t hurt them in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.400" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">and this renders them helpless and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.720" end="01:07:10.319" style="s2">hopeless and frankly incompetent and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:15.440" style="s2">they grow up into</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.319" end="01:07:17.760" style="s2">well anarchists actually so um</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.440" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">again i will butcher this man&#39;s name i</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.760" end="01:07:21.599" style="s2">apologize</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.159" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">saying to them</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.279" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">we trusted them to be reasonable we</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">trusted them</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:50.719" style="s2">to be honest and honorable we taught</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:54.719" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.719" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">to assess rules and to obey good ones</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.719" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">and to undermine bad ones and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:00.960" style="s2">we will all make mistakes about which</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:03.520" style="s2">rules are bad and which rules are good</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.960" end="01:09:05.359" style="s2">but not simply to trust on the basis</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.520" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">that someone told you you needed to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.359" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:14.480" style="s2">this points out why i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:18.239" style="s2">that is so important not only that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.480" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">our boys now 14 and 16 are growing into</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.239" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">you know anti-fragile strong</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:24.560" style="s2">compassionate</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">brilliant young men but that they</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.560" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">actually have the courage of their</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">convictions</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">and when they don&#39;t know something they</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:31.440" style="s2">know that they don&#39;t know it and are</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">willing to say so</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.440" end="01:09:38.719" style="s2">and um they know from all the way back</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.799" end="01:09:41.679" style="s2">that we trusted them to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.719" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">to be honest and to be courageous so if</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.679" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">i can um</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">just glance at this from a slightly</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:50.799" style="s2">different angle</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">there is something about a proper</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">familial relationship in which</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">there can be a kind of candor</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:07.920" style="s2">because there is no optionality about</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:08.880" style="s2">the relationship itself yeah and so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.920" end="01:10:10.480" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.880" end="01:10:13.760" style="s2">you know and if you think about you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.480" end="01:10:16.960" style="s2">the the stasi</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.760" end="01:10:19.360" style="s2">or whatever and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.960" end="01:10:21.199" style="s2">terrorizing of people by getting them to</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.360" end="01:10:22.000" style="s2">rat on each other and things it breaks</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.199" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.000" end="01:10:25.679" style="s2">fundamental bond but it is normal and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:29.280" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.679" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">for your family members to be the only</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.280" end="01:10:33.040" style="s2">people who can voice certain things in</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:35.760" style="s2">an era where certain</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.040" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">false ideas are spread as if they are</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.760" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.320" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">the place where you will hear actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not right is at home</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:44.480" style="s2">and this has been true forever right</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.960" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">um and not just from parents from</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.480" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">siblings from</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:49.679" style="s2">right exactly your cousins from whoever</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:50.159" style="s2">it is that is that is in your home with</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.679" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.159" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">anybody who doesn&#39;t have an option and</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.400" end="01:10:56.480" style="s2">this becomes very different when you may</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">not know your cousins right when</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.480" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">you only gather at certain ceremonial</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.840" end="01:11:06.080" style="s2">uh phenomena or whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">but it is vitally important that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.080" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">recognize that there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:11.440" style="s2">of lying that goes on</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:12.560" style="s2">in the world you know it&#39;s automatic</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.440" end="01:11:13.920" style="s2">that there would be for</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.560" end="01:11:16.000" style="s2">all sorts of different reasons for</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.920" end="01:11:17.600" style="s2">business reasons for reasons of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.000" end="01:11:19.440" style="s2">you know people trying to get into each</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.600" end="01:11:20.239" style="s2">other&#39;s pants there&#39;s all kinds of lying</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.440" end="01:11:22.000" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.239" end="01:11:23.280" style="s2">where can you depend on people not to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.000" end="01:11:24.640" style="s2">that well you should be able to depend</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.280" end="01:11:28.560" style="s2">on them not to do it at home</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.640" end="01:11:32.320" style="s2">yes and yes you know so for example</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.560" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">um you know the idea that masculinity is</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.320" end="01:11:35.280" style="s2">toxic</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">and that you shouldn&#39;t engage in it</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.280" end="01:11:38.960" style="s2">right because it&#39;s just bad</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:40.480" style="s2">right well that could result if you were</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.960" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">a boy and nobody told you the truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.480" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:46.159" style="s2">that could result in you weakening</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.239" end="01:11:47.840" style="s2">yourself and emasculating yourself</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.159" end="01:11:49.280" style="s2">thinking that that might be the only way</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.840" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">for you to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.280" end="01:11:55.040" style="s2">you know a proper romantic relationship</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:56.640" style="s2">and then you&#39;re gonna find out what oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.040" end="01:11:58.320" style="s2">women don&#39;t like weak men</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.640" end="01:11:59.679" style="s2">so you&#39;ve gotten rid of whatever</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.320" end="01:12:00.880" style="s2">strength you had that might have been</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.679" end="01:12:03.040" style="s2">attractive and</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.880" end="01:12:04.400" style="s2">so in any case somebody has to sit you</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.040" end="01:12:06.000" style="s2">down and say look i know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.400" end="01:12:08.960" style="s2">what people are saying but it&#39;s garbage</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:09.520" style="s2">and here&#39;s why yeah and strength is not</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.960" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.520" end="01:12:13.280" style="s2">those are two different things right</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.600" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">women don&#39;t want violent men but they</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.280" end="01:12:16.239" style="s2">also don&#39;t want weak men</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:17.920" style="s2">right and in fact strong men don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.239" end="01:12:18.880" style="s2">to engage in violence very frequently</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.920" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">the point is they</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.880" end="01:12:22.080" style="s2">they have the restraint and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:26.239" style="s2">discipline to deal with it so</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.080" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">um the the point though is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.239" end="01:12:29.280" style="s2">going after the nuclear family is</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:31.760" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.280" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">in order to disrupt the imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.760" end="01:12:33.920" style="s2">every household</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">somebody is saying actually you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.920" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">that&#39;s you got to say it</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">outside but here</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:39.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to say that because we</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:41.280" style="s2">know better that would weaken</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:42.880" style="s2">the revolution so the revolution has to</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.280" end="01:12:44.239" style="s2">break apart the family or render its</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.880" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">suspect or something</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.239" end="01:12:47.360" style="s2">in order to do what it does you go after</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:49.040" style="s2">the family and you go after men</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.360" end="01:12:50.239" style="s2">and you&#39;ve done a lot of the job that</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.040" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">you need to do of what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.239" end="01:12:53.920" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:56.880" style="s2">is weaken the links between people</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.920" end="01:12:59.120" style="s2">and this also explains why we are seeing</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.880" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">such a heavy concentration of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.120" end="01:13:04.080" style="s2">in schools of ed in schools themselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:05.360" style="s2">and especially</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.080" end="01:13:07.199" style="s2">schools where we&#39;re dealing with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.360" end="01:13:10.640" style="s2">very young children because the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.199" end="01:13:12.080" style="s2">complexity of raising children where you</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.640" end="01:13:13.760" style="s2">tell them the truth at home</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.080" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">and then wondering if they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.760" end="01:13:17.840" style="s2">say something at school that is going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:18.719" style="s2">reveal that your family isn&#39;t on board</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.840" end="01:13:20.719" style="s2">yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.719" end="01:13:22.400" style="s2">is yeah now and they&#39;re testifying to</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.719" end="01:13:24.320" style="s2">say the least i think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.400" end="01:13:25.520" style="s2">from this uh quote that i&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.320" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">read but um</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.520" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">drear also reports in the book um how</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">you know in in many of the totalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">regimes of course</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:36.159" style="s2">schools are used as replacements for</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:38.800" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.159" end="01:13:39.679" style="s2">and and students are taught that when</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.800" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.679" end="01:13:42.560" style="s2">have when they hear a discrepancy</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.280" end="01:13:43.280" style="s2">between what they hear at home what they</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.560" end="01:13:44.640" style="s2">hear in school</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.280" end="01:13:46.719" style="s2">they must trust the state they must</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.640" end="01:13:49.679" style="s2">trust the school and in this case</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.719" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">in you know 21st century weird countries</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.679" end="01:13:53.040" style="s2">including the united states</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:13:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not about the state versus the</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.040" end="01:13:55.440" style="s2">family but it is about the schools</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.400" end="01:13:59.040" style="s2">versus the family</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.440" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">and um and you know the schools are</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.040" end="01:14:02.800" style="s2">well captured they they truly are with</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:05.440" style="s2">this ideology</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.800" end="01:14:07.360" style="s2">so uh maria komaromi who is a catholic</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.440" end="01:14:09.520" style="s2">teacher in budapest says</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.360" end="01:14:11.040" style="s2">it&#39;s no accident that every dictatorship</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.520" end="01:14:12.320" style="s2">always tries to break down the family</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.040" end="01:14:14.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s in the family that you get</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.320" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">the strength to be able to fight</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.159" end="01:14:17.040" style="s2">you have the feeling that they have your</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:18.320" style="s2">backs you can go out into the world and</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.040" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">face anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.320" end="01:14:22.000" style="s2">it is just as true today as it was under</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:23.280" style="s2">communism she said that to drear in</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.000" end="01:14:24.640" style="s2">modern times</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.280" end="01:14:26.640" style="s2">so i would say that this is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.640" end="01:14:28.080" style="s2">right and it strangely points to</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.640" end="01:14:29.760" style="s2">well it&#39;s not strange it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.080" end="01:14:31.120" style="s2">strange to you or me but it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.760" end="01:14:33.120" style="s2">point to</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.120" end="01:14:34.719" style="s2">uh a danger in two distinct modern</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.120" end="01:14:36.560" style="s2">parenting styles that would seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.719" end="01:14:40.239" style="s2">at odds but they&#39;re actually two</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.560" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">very bad sides of a bad of a bad coin</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.239" end="01:14:43.840" style="s2">which is that helicopter parenting uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">which protects children from</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.840" end="01:14:50.480" style="s2">all risk and insult uh and would seem</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:51.440" style="s2">to uh you know then creates the need for</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.480" end="01:14:53.360" style="s2">safe spaces</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.440" end="01:14:54.480" style="s2">and you know creates creates young</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.360" end="01:14:56.239" style="s2">adults who are</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.480" end="01:14:58.480" style="s2">in you know adult and body only and</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.239" end="01:15:00.159" style="s2">really have never experienced anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.480" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">to push back against to learn how to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:05.520" style="s2">in the world in combination with</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:06.800" style="s2">letting babies cry themselves to sleep</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.520" end="01:15:08.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.800" end="01:15:10.320" style="s2">alone and putting them on schedules</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.800" end="01:15:14.000" style="s2">right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.320" end="01:15:17.199" style="s2">that&#39;s equally insane right a tiny</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.000" end="01:15:19.280" style="s2">a tiny child who does not yet</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.199" end="01:15:21.440" style="s2">have relationships in the world who does</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.280" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">not yet know that there is anyone or</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.440" end="01:15:24.800" style="s2">anything to trust</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:26.320" style="s2">needs the connection more than anything</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.800" end="01:15:28.960" style="s2">so that once</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.320" end="01:15:31.040" style="s2">once that child knows that they have one</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.960" end="01:15:32.239" style="s2">hopefully two parents hopefully more</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.040" end="01:15:35.040" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.239" end="01:15:36.000" style="s2">but who 100 have their back who are with</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.040" end="01:15:38.080" style="s2">them all the time</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.000" end="01:15:39.040" style="s2">who will pick them up if they cry and</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.080" end="01:15:40.400" style="s2">who are not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.040" end="01:15:42.239" style="s2">bullied by them who are not going to let</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.400" end="01:15:45.120" style="s2">this child be a terrorist but</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.239" end="01:15:45.600" style="s2">um who are going to 100 have their back</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.120" end="01:15:48.080" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.600" end="01:15:49.679" style="s2">very early you can let that child start</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.080" end="01:15:51.920" style="s2">to go out and take risks</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.679" end="01:15:54.239" style="s2">and you know and handle knives in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.920" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">kitchen and go out on a bike ride</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.239" end="01:15:59.280" style="s2">at ages that most weird parents most</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:00.640" style="s2">modern american parents wouldn&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.280" end="01:16:03.840" style="s2">letting their children do</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.640" end="01:16:05.280" style="s2">but um but children become capable very</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.840" end="01:16:08.320" style="s2">very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.280" end="01:16:12.080" style="s2">but only if they 100 know</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.320" end="01:16:13.040" style="s2">that you that there is a hopefully two</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.080" end="01:16:15.840" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.040" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">absolutely with love and adoration for</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.840" end="01:16:18.080" style="s2">them watching their back who will step</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:20.000" style="s2">in if they</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.080" end="01:16:22.239" style="s2">all can to help them if they get into</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.000" end="01:16:23.360" style="s2">trouble so i think this is a brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.239" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2">and really important</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.360" end="01:16:27.520" style="s2">connection i had not not understood this</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.000" end="01:16:30.320" style="s2">before but</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.520" end="01:16:32.159" style="s2">the so it&#39;s not even know that their</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.320" end="01:16:34.400" style="s2">parents will it&#39;s below</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.159" end="01:16:35.360" style="s2">knowing yeah right attachment which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.400" end="01:16:38.960" style="s2">formed so</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.360" end="01:16:41.040" style="s2">early is the basically wired in</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.960" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">sense of security that actually allows</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.040" end="01:16:44.480" style="s2">you to be bold and face danger because</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:46.239" style="s2">you know that you can always</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.480" end="01:16:48.480" style="s2">go back to the thing that remains true</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.239" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">and that raised you so breaking</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.480" end="01:16:53.280" style="s2">attachment</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:55.600" style="s2">with the you know rather insane and</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.280" end="01:16:56.640" style="s2">counter evolutionary belief that somehow</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.600" end="01:16:59.920" style="s2">you must not</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.640" end="01:17:01.920" style="s2">be too responsive to your infant um</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.920" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">lest you you know give them the</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.920" end="01:17:04.400" style="s2">expectation that they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:06.000" style="s2">taken care of i wouldn&#39;t want to cuddle</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.400" end="01:17:09.040" style="s2">the baby</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.000" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">right that nutty</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.040" end="01:17:12.560" style="s2">uh belief structure which was so</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:17.600" style="s2">prevalent uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.560" end="01:17:20.800" style="s2">in the 60s and 70s</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.600" end="01:17:22.880" style="s2">is clearly connected in some way</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.800" end="01:17:24.080" style="s2">you&#39;ve got people who are alien to their</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.880" end="01:17:26.480" style="s2">own families</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.080" end="01:17:27.440" style="s2">right which makes them more susceptible</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.480" end="01:17:29.120" style="s2">to the message</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.440" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">that&#39;s coming from outside that they are</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.120" end="01:17:32.000" style="s2">entitled to certain things</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.719" end="01:17:33.600" style="s2">and what is it they&#39;re being told that</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.000" end="01:17:34.719" style="s2">they&#39;re entitled to they&#39;re untold</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.600" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">they&#39;re being told that they</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.719" end="01:17:41.280" style="s2">are entitled to be comfortable and feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:43.840" style="s2">safe at all times which is not life</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.280" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">right the ability to be durable and to</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.840" end="01:17:51.040" style="s2">know how you know to not be paralyzed by</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:52.159" style="s2">sense of discomfort or a momentary lack</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.040" end="01:17:54.719" style="s2">of safety</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.159" end="01:17:56.800" style="s2">is essential to being a functional adult</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.719" end="01:17:59.520" style="s2">and so basically the idea is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.800" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">hobbled these kids we&#39;ve broken their</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.520" end="01:18:03.360" style="s2">sense of where they might be safe we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:04.719" style="s2">then externally allowed them to be told</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.360" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">that they&#39;re entitled to be safe at all</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.719" end="01:18:08.400" style="s2">times and the fact that they</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:10.159" style="s2">are constantly feeling jeopardized is</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.400" end="01:18:10.560" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s responsibility and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.159" end="01:18:13.760" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.560" end="01:18:14.320" style="s2">in a position to demand redress now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.760" end="01:18:17.840" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.320" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">um it&#39;s failures all the way down yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.840" end="01:18:22.480" style="s2">it is and you know i have to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.080" end="01:18:26.000" style="s2">that most of these things came together</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.480" end="01:18:28.880" style="s2">in uh one ugly</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.000" end="01:18:30.239" style="s2">disastrous package by accident but now</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.880" end="01:18:34.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.239" end="01:18:37.360" style="s2">wow you can see it yeah no it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.000" end="01:18:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s truly awful and um in part</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.360" end="01:18:40.640" style="s2">what we see right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.640" end="01:18:43.920" style="s2">in the modern instantiation of the sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.640" end="01:18:47.040" style="s2">of revolutionary attack on the family</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.920" end="01:18:50.239" style="s2">is predicated on the fact</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.040" end="01:18:51.920" style="s2">actually that most family many families</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.239" end="01:18:54.560" style="s2">already had this destruction at their</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.920" end="01:18:56.719" style="s2">base that they had this</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.560" end="01:18:58.719" style="s2">crazy combination of make sure the</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:19:00.640" style="s2">babies are</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.719" end="01:19:01.760" style="s2">effectively abandoned so that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.640" end="01:19:04.960" style="s2">have safety</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:06.480" style="s2">and then create a dynamic where</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.960" end="01:19:07.440" style="s2">you keep them from all risk once they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.480" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">old enough where they should be</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.440" end="01:19:10.640" style="s2">experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:11.920" style="s2">risk like you know of course at some</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.640" end="01:19:13.760" style="s2">level some people will</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.920" end="01:19:15.199" style="s2">will grow up and decide that the family</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.760" end="01:19:16.560" style="s2">needs to be abolished well yes those</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.199" end="01:19:18.400" style="s2">kinds of families should because</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.560" end="01:19:19.920" style="s2">that really doesn&#39;t deserve the name</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.400" end="01:19:20.719" style="s2">that you know that that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.920" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">parenting</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:26.960" style="s2">is so confused and frankly so</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:27.679" style="s2">so dangerous to children that it it that</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.960" end="01:19:30.960" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.679" end="01:19:34.719" style="s2">um a thing of the past</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.960" end="01:19:36.560" style="s2">okay uh yep uh we have we have just a</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.719" end="01:19:39.600" style="s2">few more things that we want to</p>

<p begin="01:19:39.600" end="01:19:45.520" style="s2">regard to</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.679" end="01:19:45.520" style="s2">community um</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.640" end="01:19:51.679" style="s2">actually let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s move on first</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.920" end="01:19:54.960" style="s2">to</p>

<p begin="01:23:36.639" end="01:23:44.239" style="s2">simply not true and yet it is being</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.480" end="01:23:46.320" style="s2">it is being lifted up as this amazing</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.239" end="01:23:47.920" style="s2">piece of scholarship and beauty and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.320" end="01:23:52.239" style="s2">way that we should teach our children</p>

<p begin="01:23:54.320" end="01:23:58.800" style="s2">opposite and it seems to be frankly</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.400" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">and everything i&#39;ve seen from the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.800" end="01:24:03.120" style="s2">author of it</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.920" end="01:24:04.159" style="s2">seems to be based not in any desire to</p>

<p begin="01:24:04.159" end="01:24:08.960" style="s2">to build to create</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.199" end="01:24:10.400" style="s2">but out of a sense of hatred and</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.960" end="01:24:12.320" style="s2">divisiveness and an interest in</p>

<p begin="01:24:12.320" end="01:24:15.360" style="s2">so i think above all else it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.560" end="01:24:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.360" end="01:24:19.760" style="s2">false it&#39;s verificationist right it</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.920" end="01:24:22.560" style="s2">basically compiles</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.760" end="01:24:23.840" style="s2">pieces to paint a false picture yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.560" end="01:24:27.360" style="s2">out of things some</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.840" end="01:24:29.679" style="s2">many of which are true but um i want to</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.360" end="01:24:31.360" style="s2">kind of synthesize the the model that i</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.679" end="01:24:35.280" style="s2">think you&#39;re building here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.360" end="01:24:37.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s really quite quite good</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.280" end="01:24:38.639" style="s2">we&#39;ve hobbled people right we hobbled</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.760" end="01:24:41.760" style="s2">them in part</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.639" end="01:24:45.120" style="s2">just by throwing a totally novel</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.760" end="01:24:46.960" style="s2">world at them and them failing to know</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.120" end="01:24:48.159" style="s2">what&#39;s actually good and what feels good</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.960" end="01:24:51.600" style="s2">but is bad and</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.159" end="01:24:55.440" style="s2">yeah um so they&#39;re they&#39;re hobbled</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.600" end="01:24:58.080" style="s2">in due course they are uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.440" end="01:24:59.760" style="s2">badly miseducated and among the worst</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.080" end="01:25:00.639" style="s2">ways they are educated is that they are</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.760" end="01:25:03.520" style="s2">not given</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.639" end="01:25:05.040" style="s2">a self-motivational capacity that would</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.520" end="01:25:06.560" style="s2">cause them to be able to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.040" end="01:25:07.679" style="s2">to accomplish things so they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.560" end="01:25:09.360" style="s2">waiting to be told</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.679" end="01:25:10.719" style="s2">what to do and what they&#39;re told to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.360" end="01:25:13.760" style="s2">is of no value and</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.719" end="01:25:15.360" style="s2">is basically you know you spend your</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.760" end="01:25:18.320" style="s2">time doing somebody else&#39;s bidding</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.360" end="01:25:19.920" style="s2">right right so it&#39;s not so much anger at</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.320" end="01:25:23.440" style="s2">other people or maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.920" end="01:25:26.480" style="s2">flavor of anger it&#39;s resentment of those</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.440" end="01:25:29.760" style="s2">who are more capable and that</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.480" end="01:25:33.440" style="s2">resentment then results in</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.760" end="01:25:34.800" style="s2">a listening so these people</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.440" end="01:25:36.480" style="s2">we all have the experience of</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.800" end="01:25:37.920" style="s2">advertisers telling us oh</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.480" end="01:25:39.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with you and we</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.920" end="01:25:41.199" style="s2">have the solution here it is you just</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.760" end="01:25:42.800" style="s2">you 1995</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.199" end="01:25:44.800" style="s2">three times a month whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.800" end="01:25:45.760" style="s2">they you know whatever it is that they</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.800" end="01:25:46.960" style="s2">want us to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.760" end="01:25:48.960" style="s2">right so they&#39;re using our</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.960" end="01:25:52.480" style="s2">dissatisfaction to get us to buy stuff</p>

<p begin="01:26:12.480" end="01:26:16.960" style="s2">are you supposed to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.679" end="01:26:19.760" style="s2">well surrender all of your tools</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.960" end="01:26:21.440" style="s2">right two plus two does not equal what</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.760" end="01:26:22.000" style="s2">you were told it equals right you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:26:22.000" end="01:26:25.360" style="s2">on that stuff but listen to us we&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="01:26:25.360" end="01:26:31.520" style="s2">just go with us but the point is it is</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.120" end="01:26:32.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not even learned helplessness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.520" end="01:26:34.480" style="s2">a step</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.159" end="01:26:36.000" style="s2">beyond learned helplessness it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:26:36.000" end="01:26:41.159" style="s2">right snake oil helplessness yes it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.719" end="01:26:44.080" style="s2">it&#39;s some sort of exponential</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.159" end="01:26:45.679" style="s2">self-inflicted expanding helplessness</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.080" end="01:26:47.679" style="s2">that causes you to have no</p>

<p begin="01:26:47.679" end="01:26:50.159" style="s2">thing and given up your tools</p>

<p begin="01:26:59.120" end="01:27:02.480" style="s2">leave the boat and you know set off on</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.280" end="01:27:04.480" style="s2">your own you&#39;re just committed</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.480" end="01:27:06.400" style="s2">and once you&#39;ve given up on those tools</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.480" end="01:27:09.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no going back</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.400" end="01:27:11.760" style="s2">well especially if it takes you know if</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.440" end="01:27:13.679" style="s2">you know a you forget how to use them</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.760" end="01:27:16.080" style="s2">and b you stop being educated in</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.679" end="01:27:18.639" style="s2">anything other than woke ideology</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.080" end="01:27:20.800" style="s2">then you know of course all you can be</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.639" end="01:27:22.719" style="s2">is a foot soldier in that battle and</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.800" end="01:27:24.560" style="s2">you know you&#39;re hoping that once the</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.719" end="01:27:26.000" style="s2">spoils are collected they will be</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.560" end="01:27:28.080" style="s2">distributed to you which of course they</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.000" end="01:27:30.560" style="s2">won&#39;t because the game theory</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.080" end="01:27:31.600" style="s2">suggests that what will happen is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.560" end="01:27:34.239" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="01:27:34.239" end="01:27:39.040" style="s2">win those spoils is going to break down</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.040" end="01:27:42.800" style="s2">as soon as the spoils are won</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.040" end="01:27:45.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to become uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.800" end="01:27:46.560" style="s2">crony capitalist at best right it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:27:49.199" end="01:27:54.880" style="s2">actually suckers no</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.719" end="01:27:54.880" style="s2">of course it won&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.280" end="01:27:59.440" style="s2">okay let&#39;s talk about um privacy for a</p>

<p begin="01:28:01.679" end="01:28:04.080" style="s2">finish up we were we were just talking</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.600" end="01:28:08.080" style="s2">about</p>

<p begin="01:28:19.360" end="01:28:22.080" style="s2">something good</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.080" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">otherwise you can get really dark and</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.080" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.000" end="01:28:30.480" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:31.760" style="s2">later in the book drier is talking to a</p>

<p begin="01:28:54.960" end="01:28:58.159" style="s2">full circle here but</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.800" end="01:28:59.600" style="s2">it strikes me that some of what has</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.159" end="01:29:00.400" style="s2">happened what you were just talking</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.600" end="01:29:02.000" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.400" end="01:29:03.679" style="s2">is that we have handed all the tools of</p>

<p begin="01:29:03.679" end="01:29:06.880" style="s2">with nothing actually to resist like</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.840" end="01:29:10.080" style="s2">they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.880" end="01:29:12.239" style="s2">they they were harmed by a</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.080" end="01:29:13.199" style="s2">bunch of things over which they had no</p>

<p begin="01:29:13.199" end="01:29:17.360" style="s2">but pretending that the people who have</p>

<p begin="01:29:17.360" end="01:29:21.040" style="s2">are the people who left them without any</p>

<p begin="01:29:28.480" end="01:29:31.679" style="s2">you have these sort of historical tools</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.320" end="01:29:33.760" style="s2">of resistance like</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.679" end="01:29:35.360" style="s2">like blog posts that look like they</p>

<p begin="01:29:35.360" end="01:29:39.120" style="s2">and looking around and not knowing who</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.199" end="01:29:40.880" style="s2">the enemy is and</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.120" end="01:29:42.639" style="s2">um imagining therefore that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.880" end="01:29:44.560" style="s2">find one and the enemy is you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.639" end="01:29:46.000" style="s2">you like you must be the enemy and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.560" end="01:29:47.679" style="s2">know we we saw that</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.000" end="01:29:49.360" style="s2">three and a half years ago on on the</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.679" end="01:29:53.600" style="s2">campus where we then were</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.360" end="01:29:56.960" style="s2">um and this the lack of community</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.600" end="01:30:01.120" style="s2">that people have is is</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.960" end="01:30:03.120" style="s2">terrifying it was very bad before 2020</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.120" end="01:30:05.280" style="s2">that people raised with helicopter</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.120" end="01:30:07.600" style="s2">parents and on screens all the time</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.280" end="01:30:09.040" style="s2">had an easier time engaging through</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.600" end="01:30:10.880" style="s2">screens rather than in real</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.040" end="01:30:12.080" style="s2">in real flesh and blood and of course</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.880" end="01:30:14.960" style="s2">the lockdowns</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.080" end="01:30:15.280" style="s2">um that um are persisting in most places</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.960" end="01:30:16.639" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.280" end="01:30:18.000" style="s2">in some form or another have made it</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.639" end="01:30:20.320" style="s2">even harder to come together in</p>

<p begin="01:30:20.320" end="01:30:25.120" style="s2">but i would argue that we are actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.880" end="01:30:28.639" style="s2">at particular risk right now</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.120" end="01:30:31.600" style="s2">because shared visceral experience</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.639" end="01:30:33.840" style="s2">is a huge part of what bonds people of</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.600" end="01:30:35.600" style="s2">what brings people together and</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.840" end="01:30:37.760" style="s2">in part we just don&#39;t even have the</p>

<p begin="01:30:38.239" end="01:30:44.159" style="s2">exactly what all that is but we all know</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.520" end="01:30:46.159" style="s2">that a conversation in flesh and blood</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.159" end="01:30:49.280" style="s2">is not the same as a zoom call</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.159" end="01:30:51.840" style="s2">zoom calls cannot replace visceral</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.280" end="01:30:53.120" style="s2">flesh and blood shared space in a room</p>

<p begin="01:30:53.120" end="01:30:56.639" style="s2">uh and so right now who is allowed who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.639" end="01:30:59.679" style="s2">it&#39;s the people who are spilling onto</p>

<p begin="01:30:59.679" end="01:31:04.159" style="s2">and then some fraction of those people</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.360" end="01:31:05.920" style="s2">who are writing they are the ones then</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.159" end="01:31:07.760" style="s2">who are establishing right now their own</p>

<p begin="01:31:07.760" end="01:31:11.520" style="s2">and the rest of us are watching on a</p>

<p begin="01:31:11.520" end="01:31:16.239" style="s2">or ignoring them but we aren&#39;t also</p>

<p begin="01:31:16.239" end="01:31:20.159" style="s2">because many of us are actually engaging</p>

<p begin="01:31:52.000" end="01:31:54.400" style="s2">you were talking about with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.520" end="01:31:55.840" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.400" end="01:31:58.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which modern</p>

<p begin="01:31:58.800" end="01:32:04.159" style="s2">romance are getting in the way here</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.840" end="01:32:06.080" style="s2">because you know in the world from which</p>

<p begin="01:32:06.080" end="01:32:13.280" style="s2">you for very easily understood reasons</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.960" end="01:32:14.639" style="s2">ended up finding a partner and bonding</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.280" end="01:32:16.560" style="s2">yourself to them</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.639" end="01:32:18.400" style="s2">and the production of children</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.560" end="01:32:20.080" style="s2">especially production of children early</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.400" end="01:32:21.760" style="s2">in life</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.080" end="01:32:24.880" style="s2">results in a phenomenon this is going to</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.760" end="01:32:24.880" style="s2">sound counterintuitive but</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.280" end="01:32:30.400" style="s2">a partnership a man and a woman who</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.120" end="01:32:32.480" style="s2">produce offspring</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.400" end="01:32:33.520" style="s2">though they are not blood relatives of</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.480" end="01:32:35.040" style="s2">each other are</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.520" end="01:32:37.280" style="s2">effectively blood relatives of each</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.040" end="01:32:39.280" style="s2">other related through their children</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.280" end="01:32:40.480" style="s2">right you become blood relatives with</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.280" end="01:32:41.760" style="s2">somebody when you produce children with</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.480" end="01:32:43.679" style="s2">them so the idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.760" end="01:32:46.639" style="s2">that the point of life is now very</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.679" end="01:32:48.480" style="s2">remote from the production of children</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.639" end="01:32:51.199" style="s2">means that to the extent that people</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.480" end="01:32:53.040" style="s2">have those partnerships they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.199" end="01:32:54.320" style="s2">much closer to friendships than family</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.040" end="01:32:57.679" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.320" end="01:32:58.800" style="s2">people are you know experimenting with</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.679" end="01:33:01.120" style="s2">all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.800" end="01:33:02.159" style="s2">new configurations and none of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.120" end="01:33:05.520" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.159" end="01:33:07.199" style="s2">stable so in one sense i wonder if some</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.520" end="01:33:10.080" style="s2">of the insanity that we&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.199" end="01:33:11.920" style="s2">from otherwise reasonable young people</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.080" end="01:33:12.960" style="s2">is actually the result of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.920" end="01:33:15.120" style="s2">at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.960" end="01:33:17.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t even have that one person with</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.120" end="01:33:18.000" style="s2">whom you can be candid about what you</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.120" end="01:33:21.040" style="s2">actually think</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.000" end="01:33:23.840" style="s2">because you&#39;re not related by something</p>

<p begin="01:33:23.840" end="01:33:28.080" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.400" end="01:33:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s important um here we&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="01:38:24.080" end="01:38:28.840" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.639" end="01:38:32.080" style="s2">of a life in which you know the most</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.840" end="01:38:34.960" style="s2">um productive thing you did was</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.080" end="01:38:36.960" style="s2">you know basically curate a series of</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.960" end="01:38:39.920" style="s2">brands into some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.960" end="01:38:40.960" style="s2">you know slightly personal identity</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.920" end="01:38:45.040" style="s2">right that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.960" end="01:38:48.800" style="s2">that&#39;s nothing to aspire to and um</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.040" end="01:38:50.880" style="s2">so anyway yes uh i</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.800" end="01:38:52.560" style="s2">am increasingly disturbed by the fact</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.880" end="01:38:54.480" style="s2">that it seems to me that we have a very</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.560" end="01:38:55.760" style="s2">immediate problem the solution to which</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.480" end="01:38:59.040" style="s2">is obviously</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.760" end="01:39:02.880" style="s2">uh several generations</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.040" end="01:39:03.840" style="s2">of work right what do we do about the</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.880" end="01:39:07.760" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.840" end="01:39:09.800" style="s2">um if you solved the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.760" end="01:39:11.040" style="s2">woke ideology in our slide towards</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.800" end="01:39:12.560" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.040" end="01:39:13.920" style="s2">tomorrow you still have a large</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.560" end="01:39:15.840" style="s2">population of people who have been</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.920" end="01:39:19.119" style="s2">hobbled by the stupid way we have</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.840" end="01:39:22.400" style="s2">dealt with um education and</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.119" end="01:39:25.040" style="s2">uh development and pharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.400" end="01:39:26.719" style="s2">and all of that stuff and you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.040" end="01:39:28.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no way around it that has to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.719" end="01:39:30.000" style="s2">dealt with and it is actually our</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.000" end="01:39:32.800" style="s2">collective obligation to deal with it</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.000" end="01:39:33.760" style="s2">yes um and if we don&#39;t it will come for</p>
