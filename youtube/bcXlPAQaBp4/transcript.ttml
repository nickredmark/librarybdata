<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">uh so effective altruism is about uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">trying to figure out how can we use our</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">time and money as effectively as</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">possible to make the world a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">and then once we&#39;ve got some these</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">tentative answers to that question</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">taking action on that basis and so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">might mean doing research to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">what charity is most effective</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">that help other people or sentient</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">creatures by as much as possible with</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">the marginal dollar you can give them uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">and then you know first figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">what those most effective charities</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">and then uh taking action by donating to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">or it might mean figuring out what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">the career paths where you can have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">biggest impact</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">and then after that pursuing those clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">um pursuing those career paths and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">my role in this so way back in 2009</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">i co-founded giving what we can which</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">was an organization that encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">people to give at least 10</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">of their earnings uh to the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">effective charities</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">that of the charities they believed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">be most effective and we had a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">set of recommended charities there</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">and uh since then i&#39;ve co-founded a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">other organizations</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">including 80 000 hours which focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">the career side of things providing</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">advice on</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">what um careers are most impactful</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">and what i&#39;m working on most at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">moment is my research</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">at the global priorities institute which</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">is part of oxford</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">which is addressing some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">theoretical or fundamental questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">that you face</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">if you are an individual trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">the biggest possible positive impact on</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">cool so hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">a whole bunch of different directions</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">that we could go with this um</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">i imagine it would be pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">to talk a little bit more about some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">these global priorities that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">what are some of the different ways that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">individuals might choose to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">their impact</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">um yeah absolutely so um</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">additionally uh within effects of</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">kind of four camps as it were</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">or at least tend to be four focus areas</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">so one which is kind of where i started</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">was focusing on global health and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">the argument there being well if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">want to do the most good</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">focus on the poor very poorest people in</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">the world and we can certainly do an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">enormous amount of good there</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">saving a life for just a few thousand</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">pounds uh a second</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">major cause area is uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">the welfare of animals on non-human uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">non-human animals</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">on factually farms where the sheer scale</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">of this problem is just</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">enormous you know 60 billion animals</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">killed every year for food</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">the vast majority of them are factually</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">found living in conditions of extreme</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">and in particular because this issue is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">so neglected receiving just a few tens</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">of millions of dollars of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">philanthropic funding every year there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">you can you know do an enormous amount</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">of impact</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">so significantly improving the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">hundreds of animals with every dollar</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.160" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">you spend</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">uh the third category are things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">are aimed at the long-term future</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">and making sure that civilization as a</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t uh suffer some terrible</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">perhaps of its own making so climate</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">change i think obviously in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">um where uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">you know we are as a result of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">um economic growth without having the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">technology to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">reduce our carbon emissions uh we are</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">you know impaling the future of human</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">civilization if we were to continue in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">this path for</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">um centuries to come uh this is the and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">therefore making life worse for</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">generations centuries to come</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">but there are other things too that have</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">potential risks with</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">global catastrophe so i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">arguments for thinking that developments</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">synthetic biology in particular the</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">new sorts of pathogens and developments</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">in artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">are the sorts of technologies where we</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">want to be very careful and very</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">sensible</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:42.319" style="s2">because things could go very well as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">result of those technologies or they</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.319" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">could go quite badly</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">and we want to be ahead of the curve and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">proactive and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">in particular these are some things</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">where the outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">could to the result could have effects</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">that last</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">centuries millennia or even like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">entire kind of future</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">of human civilization then the final</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">category are</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">what we call kind of meta activities so</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">say well the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">actually is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">not any particular object level activity</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">but instead kind of building a movement</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">around these ideas getting more people</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.160" style="s2">or doing a research in order to figure</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">out uh what the most important</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.160" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">um what the most important things we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">be doing are</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">and those are the kind of four broad</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">categories of uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">things that people in effective</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">elections tend to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">and i think so 80 000 hours is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">organization that helps do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">career coaching for</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">especially for people who are graduating</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">high school graduating university and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">the what it is that i want to do with my</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">life is to make the biggest impact in</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">to do the most good that i can with my</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">and so as a community if effective</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">altruism is sort of looking in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">these different categories of things uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">global health um animal welfare</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">long-term thinking and uh and meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">activities</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">how does how does one decide which of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">these broad domains is even</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">the the most ethically correct or like</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">which which playground do i want to play</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">in for my life if i&#39;m trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:21.040" style="s2">decision yeah i mean it&#39;s a super tough</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">question and so that&#39;s the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">we&#39;re really focused on so one at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">set of heuristics that we like to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:29.519" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">comparing causes is what we call the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">importance neglect and distractibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">so here the idea is to think well</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">importance is just how big of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">neglectedness is how many resources are</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">already going towards that problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">where in general it seems you can do</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">more good</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">on areas that are more neglected</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">relative to how</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">big a problem they are and then third is</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">factability which is just</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">how intrinsically difficult is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">problem how you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">how much um closeness can we make</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">with uh you know a given push</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">and when it you know most of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">kind of action when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">prioritizing among these comes on how we</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">assess the importance side of things so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">if i&#39;m thinking about um you know animal</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">welfare versus the welfare of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">well you&#39;ve got this incredibly tough</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">question about how you should weigh</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">the interest of humans against the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">interests of non-human animals</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">uh when we&#39;re thinking about in issues</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">that might</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">impact the very long run we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">ask the ethical question of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">um how should we weigh the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">future generations against the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">um interests of the people today</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">how should we think about more</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:50.079" style="s2">speculative impacts</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">where we&#39;re kind of less certain that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.079" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">we are going to have any impact at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">but if we do it then it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">very large</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">versus a greater guarantee of um</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">you know reliably having an impact that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">you might be able to do in other areas</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">such as global health um and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">finally there&#39;s the question of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">uh what moral philosophers call</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">population ethics</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">so some of these things like possibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">of man-made viruses</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">you know they threaten the survival of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">the human race into the future</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">and that raises this question well how</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">bad would that be</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">uh in particular should we think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">like the loss of future lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">in the sense of them being prevented</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">from coming into existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">because the human race has gone extinct</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">before it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">um how bad is that morally speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">there&#39;s been an enormous amount of kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">of philosophical debate there</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve talked about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">mobile philosophy lens there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">obviously also um you know world view</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">judgments you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">like how likely do you think these</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">various</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">um risks of global could ask the vr um</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">how plausible do you think it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">the case for that we can do something</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">about them or similarly kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">empirical questions on other areas too</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">um but uh once we start</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:09.839" style="s2">getting into those um issues then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">can start getting a sense like okay how</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.839" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">big are these different problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">and then we can compare that against um</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:16.959" style="s2">well how much funding</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">is already going towards them how much</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">uh and like how much does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">people are actually able to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">photographs in this area</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">yeah yeah and so we actually do have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">question from the audience so far so uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">for folks who have questions feel free</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">to pop those into the chat</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">um so this question is from dan um</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">he says how to address the critique that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">philanthropy is a form of misanthropy</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">and instead of addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.800" style="s2">sociopathic and antisocial and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.320" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">omnicidal behaviors at the core of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.800" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">single bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">political economy philanthropy just</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:12:59.720" style="s2">addresses</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">the negative externalities of collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.720" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">epistemological and ontological</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">delusions</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">instead of rewilding politics and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">building new worlds in new regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">economies</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">so that was a lot of words um my</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.880" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">understanding of this question</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">um is something akin to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">uh thinking about particular issues um</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">issue by issue versus</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">looking at rebuilding a system or</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">totally changing the system</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:30.720" style="s2">uh yeah so if again i thought um</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">the dan pog you know presumably had in</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.720" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">mind as well the thought that like</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">uh the root kind of problem here is um</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">you know kind of capitalist framework or</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">something and um</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">capitalist system and instead we should</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">be really trying to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.000" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">um creating alternatives to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">um so i think i guess a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">um one is uh you know philanthropy can</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">be used to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">almost anything you know people um</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">associate philanthropy with kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">giving arms um as in alms</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">not arms as in weapons um but you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">uh helping feed the sick and um</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">providing bed nets and so on</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">but you can also do it for you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">social and political experiments so</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">uh karl marx himself was funded by a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:21.519" style="s2">philanthropist um</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">uh frederick engels who was working at</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.519" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">his uncle&#39;s firm in order to provide</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">um for marx&#39;s writing and printing costs</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">um and similarly if you want as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">philanthropist then you can um</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">try and perhaps fund the search into</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">alternate</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">alter alternative um institutional</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">arrangements</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">um or expand living so</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the nature of the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">to debar yourself from doing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">um but then the second question is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">well is that the most effective thing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">um and there i suspect it&#39;s not um and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">a couple of reasons um one is just the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">feasibility of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">overthrow capitalism in favor of some</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">other um</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">institutional arrangement uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">historically other institutional</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">arrangements have not tended to work</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:10.639" style="s2">um i think we have a pretty good sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">of what the best countries</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.639" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">um ever have been and there&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">of scandinavian countries</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">denmark sweden where you have uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">private property ownership but large</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">amounts of redistribution</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">um and then secondly is just the fee but</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t think that capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">is the end state of society i hope that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">we move beyond it in the future</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">but then the second is just like well</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">the feasibility of doing so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">where it seems that um to me that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:41.680" style="s2">being able to move off a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">society in a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">in a way that seems robustly positive in</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">the near term</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">just seems kind of astronomically</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:52.839" style="s2">unlikely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">and instead more targeted interventions</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.839" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">direct the kind of economic system we</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">in ways that we&#39;re avoiding like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">very worst outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">such as catastrophic climate change</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">which results from</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">implo uh inappropriately priced</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">um fossil fuel uh consumption</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">or um the uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">factory farming of you know billions of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">animals that again results from like</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">inappropriate regulation</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">i think it makes more sense to target</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">those um</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">like very worst issues because then</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be able to just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">move things somewhat but having enormous</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">benefits because you precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve targeted like</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">the very worst aspects of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">and and i think the other interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">part about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">effective altruism as a community is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">looking at a whole bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">levels like i&#39;m a part of a facebook</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">group which is effective altruism</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">systems change</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">um and it&#39;s people that are all talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">about how do we actually change the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">rules in which the games are being</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">played</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">um and so it&#39;s interesting trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">coordinate between a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">groups taking a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">strategies but it&#39;s almost as though the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">portfolio of effective altruism</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">is going to be looking at the individual</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">cases as well as the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">uh yeah i think it&#39;s a great point is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">we in effective autism very much see</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">this as a research project like an</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s like a methodology it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">question that we&#39;re trying to address</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">and so it might be the case that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">have some</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">provisional set of answers um but</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">uh perhaps yeah different set of answers</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">is better too and i&#39;ve supported some</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s trying to make um</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">institutional decision making better in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">particular the center for election</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">science which is campaigning for</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">voting reform um in the u.s i&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">champion of recently</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">and recommended the clan to them</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">um pranab would you like to read your</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:18:01.039" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">yeah sure thanks will one question i had</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.039" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">kind of surround philanthropy in general</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">and um one large competing philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">which you kind of hinted on</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">was that people often prefer to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">feel-good philanthropy</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">whether it&#39;s due to more like humanized</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">or it&#39;s based on their own life</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:17.919" style="s2">experience such as donational alma mater</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">or a cause that they personally feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.919" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">affected by</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">or stuff that just pulls at heartstrings</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">so i guess my question is what are your</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">views on that kind of motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">how do you think we could shift more</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">people maybe towards like a mix of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">plus effective altruism</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">um and then one question that robert</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">asked that was kind of a follow-up to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">mine was</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">do you how do you kind of factor in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">effect on the giver</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">in um kind of marketing or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">working with effective altruism this</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">kind of i guess falls in the meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">activity increasing awareness</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">yeah yeah um yeah so again a great</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">question so i mean i think like</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">the motivation we have when we see</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">suffering in front of us and want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">take action</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">and um therefore like moved by that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">um you know particular problem we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">seen perhaps it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">you know an earthquake or a tsunami that</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">was in the news at a time</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">and um oh you want to help that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">particular thing you know i just think</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">that&#39;s a really noble</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">instinct and i think for most of human</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">history that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">following that instinct would have</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">served us fairly well</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">um and so it&#39;s just that we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">very odd circumstance where</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">our money and time can do so much good</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">often for perhaps people we will never</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">see or people we could never see those</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">people who will exist in the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">years to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">um that&#39;s like a very hard thing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">intuitively to get planned</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why like what we try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">do is just um</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">firstly place those motivations and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">secondly provide arguments</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">and information to try and challenge</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">channel people</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">when they have that motivation to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">realizing okay i&#39;m seeing this disaster</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">i&#39;m really moved</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">but like this is just the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">is most salient to me now</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">um that&#39;s like i&#39;ve seen a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">spotlight sean on this but there are so</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">many problems every day but i&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:08.720" style="s2">not even thinking about most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">and i should just take this motivation</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.720" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">and use it to focus on where i can have</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">the biggest impact</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">um and so the way i feel about it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">just yet positive</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">but then wanting to channel it in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">right directions and i know that many</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">so for example who are giving what we</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">can members and pledge to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">10 of their income choose to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">also on top of that give to some causes</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">that they just feel personally very</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">passionate about and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">um uh but the thing that i want to guard</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">against is people</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">um uh feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">oh well if i&#39;ve just given to somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of really moved me</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">i&#39;ve therefore kind of done the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">good because i think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">um and then a follow-up question um</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">do i measure the effects upon the givers</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">um i mean we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">so for example within giving what we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">we don&#39;t have anything scientific um</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">on our members that are looking at kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">of how happy before or after</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">um i think it also wouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">generalize because we&#39;d be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">those people who have opted into giving</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">ten percent</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">and it might be hard to do a randomized</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">controlled file of people giving ten</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">percent or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">uh we do have plenty of anecdote of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:29.039" style="s2">you know when you talk to a given what</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">we can member</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.039" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">they uniformly say there&#39;s been this</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">enormously rewarding and positive impact</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">on their life</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">um and that&#39;s in sync with the broader</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">psychological literature</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">which firstly uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">very strongly suggests that lower if</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">you&#39;re already in a rich currency lower</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">than your income by a bit such as by 10</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">makes almost a negligible difference to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">your well-being</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">i certainly found that to be the case in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">my life and then secondly there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">um personal benefits to giving as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">you feel good feel good about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like humans are altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">creatures and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">if you feel like you&#39;re helping to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">the world a better place well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">speak a bit let&#39;s be a meaningful thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">and uh yeah that just seems to be borne</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:48.559" style="s2">collective that&#39;s there which is um is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">it helpful</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.559" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">for each person to stretch their</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">own personal um or collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">development by feeling into the tension</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">between for instance</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">effectiveness and efficiency or between</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">enumerated categories that you listed</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">above</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">these these these tensions actually give</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">some personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">directiveness to what&#39;s important to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">and how do i</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">find that rather than looking at some</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">global oh this is the best thing or the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">most efficient thing or the best good</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">that&#39;s done but</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">the tension of that feels like a a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">developmental frame and i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">about your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">uh okay so are you asking the question</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">how important is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">yeah you might be personally very</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">delivered or motivated</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">towards certain causes um how should</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">that factor into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">question so to clarify you know the last</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">thing i ask there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">this implicates looking more deeply at</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">the motivation that might actually be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">selfless expression of wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">alleviate pain to alleviate alleviate my</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">own suffering</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">there&#39;s something that you you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">um kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.080" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">the the desire to kind of alleviate</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">suffering but</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">suffering is actually a beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">driver for our own personal development</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">and and evolutionary growth so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">want to completely diminish that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">and there&#39;s some sense of um if we get</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">we can get kind of blindsided in an</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">altruistic movement</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">to trying to reduce suffering overall</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">rather than actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">finding the the most optimal</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">edge of suffering in our own personal</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">development and that&#39;s kind of what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">looking at is</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">is are there way do you have to see ways</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">of of actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">asking that question more personally how</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">do i how do i stretch into my own</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">suffering at the optimal level for me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">develop</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">okay yeah it&#39;s a good question where um</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">you know i&#39;m normally talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">already uh very motivated and often</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">cautioning against people</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">you know going too hard because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">a risk you can burn yourself out like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to stretch yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">like feel so guilty run yourself down</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">into the ground</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">you never do any good at all um but on</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">the other hand you&#39;re absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">seeing something feeling pain in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">response to that that&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">um reaction and in my own case like</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">when i first was thinking about these</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">ideas and i was trying to decide</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">how much of my income should i try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">give away over the course of my life</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">um i just went on</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">google for images um looking up images</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">of children suffering from neglected</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">topical diseases</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">and just kind of just clicked through</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">just these horrible images time after</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">and that was just very motivating for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">because i just thought well</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">um you know there was one child who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">had um elephantiasis um of the face it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">um clearly just like a debilitating</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">and i just thought well if my money</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:51.039" style="s2">could just prevent</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">one child like um so if there&#39;s money i</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.039" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">could give could just prevent one child</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">from suffering from a condition that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">know that extreme</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">um wow that would be just completely</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">worth it but i can actually do that like</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">hundreds thousands of times</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">um over and so i think there is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">optimal balance</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">um i think that can be a reason for</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">visiting developing countries if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">interested in global health and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">visiting factory farms um uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">in order to get kind of upfront</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.400" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">uh evidence um about what this</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">suffering is like uh but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">hand you don&#39;t want to go too far</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">and certainly by the time</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">that you know i think of this like pain</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">like guilt turmoil is like the thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:37.520" style="s2">that can like really</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">get you off your seat and then doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.520" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">something and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">once you find you know you&#39;ve decided</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">what percentage of your income you want</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">to give</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">perhaps you have now moved your career</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">onto a path where you think it could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">high impact</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">at that point i encourage kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">thinking about it like a job like kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:55.279" style="s2">of like anything else</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">because if you&#39;re just like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.279" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">you know get more juice out of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">by really beating yourself up day out</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.400" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">day after day that&#39;s not sustainable um</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.400" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">whereas</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">if you pick kind of light levels that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">you think yes i would be happy with this</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">level of effort for the rest of my life</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">like that&#39;s where you want to be i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">one of the groups that i imagine is sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">of placing a bunch of tension</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">into the collective consciousness uh and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if suffering would be the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">term would be um extinction rebellion um</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">really forcing humanity to look</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">straight at um the climate change</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">um peter you&#39;ve got a question that sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">of relates in that area</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">questions but i&#39;ll say this one first so</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">uh before</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">kovid i was planning on setting up a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">dialogue actually with uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">ea ryan&#39;s group here in toronto with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">local extinction rebellion group</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">and there are other groups like</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">extinction rebellion that are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">existential risks suffering risks the</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">but are doing so with uh wildly</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">different methods</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">do you have any thoughts on these groups</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.159" style="s2">um xr or otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">uh do you think there are other ways to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.159" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">do good uh or do you sense that the ea</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">is the right approach that should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">wildly uh widely adopted</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:18.399" style="s2">uh terrific yeah so um i feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">yeah very positive on extinction</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.399" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">um seems like uh certainly in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">where um i know about</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">more um just managed to really</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">um get this incredible upswell</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">of protests and involvement from a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">large number of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">very quickly um in response to one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">the most important problems of our time</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">um and you know that&#39;s just fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">and policy and politicians just like do</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">take this seriously</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">um it would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">something i&#39;d like to see more of is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">like a focus on</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">particular um solutions</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">so uh i think politicians really can</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">bend</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:06.320" style="s2">um to popular pressure like this and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">want to make it as</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">like easy and direct for them to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">in particular by saying like what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">want to see is this particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">my own view and the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">the most effective actions that any</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">individual country</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">or philanthropist but let&#39;s focus on</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">currency can do in response to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">climate change um is funding</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">uh innovation in clean energy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">the reason for that is uh take a country</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">um the united kingdom it&#39;s responsible</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">for about four percent of global</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">emissions</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">so if the united kingdom gets all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">way down to zero emissions um</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">itself uh that&#39;s done a very limited</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">amount</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">to um reduce climate change and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">other countries might compensate to some</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">um in contrast if it spent a similar</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">amount as it spends on</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">aid for example on clean energy</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">innovation it would double the clean</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">energy innovation budget</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">and that is a benefit that was spread</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">all over the world because if you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">make it cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">um to get energy from uh clean sources</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">rather than fossil fuels um then</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">uh just see what the power of um</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:24.000" style="s2">self-interest although um other</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">countries will</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.000" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">uh follow suit um</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s fairly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">and i think that like the protest</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">um could be considerably more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">again if they had a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">message like that that was saying like</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">look we&#39;ve consulted with like oil and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:43.679" style="s2">policy experts and we think</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">like this exact thing is what you should</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">be doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">um especially if that message is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">partly designed to be something that um</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">that the government kind of really could</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">um could get on board with</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">uh and then you had another question</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">about criticisms but um i&#39;ll pause for</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">the moment there</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">yeah uh i&#39;ll ask that one um let me just</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">read it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">okay so are there any criticisms of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">effective altruism movement</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">uh an approach that you have encountered</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:17.919" style="s2">if so could you</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">share to believe steel man them yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.919" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:29.039" style="s2">uh the best criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">of um effective altruism</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.039" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">are about the particular focuses that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">chosen rather than about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">general approach</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">so my views that kind of general</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">work out what does the most good and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">take action on that basis seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.919" end="00:31:50.480" style="s2">hard to dispute with</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">um to dispute um whereas you could say</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.480" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">look there&#39;s gonna be errors along the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">um or you&#39;ve like made a mistake with</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">like the particular focus areas</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">and one line of criticism that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">often had</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">is this quest from both directions</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">is the issue of how much should you rely</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">on more easily quantifiable netflix</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">versus</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">on things that are just more speculative</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">like harder to quantify</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">and certainly in the early days of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">effective altitude we focused</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:27.200" style="s2">very hard on those metrics that are more</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">easily quantifiable at least like cost</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">per life saved or per year of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">healthy life given or just simply</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">dollars transferred</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">into the bank accounts of the poorest</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">people in the world and people often</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:39.600" style="s2">felt like that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">focusing on the quantifiable at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.600" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">expense of the kind of bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">now that we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">much much more on these issues that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">impact the long term</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">like ensuring that developments of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">developments in synthetic biology or ai</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">go well</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">we sometimes get criticism from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">other direction uh which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">well well do you even know these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">that are doing good like how on earth</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">would you measure progress in this area</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">and um i think that&#39;s a good criticism</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:11.200" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">so uh there just is this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.200" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">between pursuing what you can measure</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">what you can get reliable feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">there you might kind of be more</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">confident you&#39;re going to do a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">versus trying to focus on the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">you just think is most important</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">in a global sense but then taking</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">actions that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">uh where it&#39;s just much harder to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">if you&#39;re actually making progress</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">um and so in a sense i think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.919" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">criticisms on either side there just</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">like are reasonable in our strong and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">that&#39;s something that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">continued debate and research can ensure</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.399" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">we make</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">later progress on cool thank you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">i think uh sahil&#39;s first question would</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">be a good follow-up for this one</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">okay oh sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">yeah hey uh and hi lions nice to see you</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">uh so well my question is uh about gpi</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">so can you talk about any particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">work of gpr you think has made some real</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">progress or at least looks highly</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">promising</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">uh yeah sure i&#39;m happy to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">that so um</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">this uh i&#39;ll caveat is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">you know not just gpi but it is um</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">you know continuing work that&#39;s occurred</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">over the last two decades</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">but is this field of population ethics</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.480" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">uh intuitively it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">you would think that kind of ethics is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">about making people happy but not making</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:39.520" style="s2">happy people</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">so if i say well</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.520" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">consider kind of two futures um</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">and they only differ by the fact that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">one future</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">there&#39;s an additional person living a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">kind of flourishing life</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">many people at least intuitively think</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">well you&#39;ve got no reason to bring one</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">future about</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">rather than another um because um</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no kind of moral requirement to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">add an extra person to the world even if</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">that person is going to be very happy</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s actually just very</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">robust arguments</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">uh for showing that that show that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">just can&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">that can&#39;t be the case um</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">one such argument is just imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">third world where we&#39;ve now got that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:25.520" style="s2">additional person</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">let&#39;s call him bob and we make it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.520" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">he&#39;d be even happier</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:31.359" style="s2">and okay that world is definitely better</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">than the world in which bob comes into</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">existence and is a bit less happy</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">but if you think that the third world is</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">better than the second world</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">then you can&#39;t think that they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:42.640" style="s2">equally as good as the first world</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">um so we at least can&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.640" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">idea of it being</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">neutral to add a person to the world um</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">in the sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:54.880" style="s2">you know keeping the world equally good</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">and so in fact i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.880" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">there are good arguments for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">that at least when someone is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:01.200" style="s2">going to be have a sufficiently good</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:01.760" style="s2">life perhaps like a very flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.200" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.760" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">then it just does make the world better</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">in partial sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">to um you know bring that person into</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">and that becomes really crucial when um</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">we think about risks that could risks of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">human extinction so</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">asteroids we&#39;re familiar with perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">worst case climate change</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">uh also like i was talking about risks</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">from synthetic biology</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">man-made viruses and so on because then</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">we&#39;re cutting off civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">after the point in time at which we go</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">extinct there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">nothing in the future um but that would</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">be potentially like trillions upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">trillions of lives lost in the future</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">and if you do think that&#39;s a moral loss</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">because those people would have</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">or many of those people would have had</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">flourishing lives well</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">that means that um</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">that means that like plausibly avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">a risk of human extinction</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">or similar catastrophes that would</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">curtail</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">humanity&#39;s potential for desirable</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">development might be the most important</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">thing because the scale is just so large</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:12.400" style="s2">there would be so many future people um</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">uh who you know whose absences um</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">would be lost whose lives would be lost</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:19.200" style="s2">uh and so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">um kind of one of the contributions that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.200" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">gpi has made that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">quite different from common sense on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">matter but</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">uh is or you know by common sense i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">kind of unphilosophical um intuitions on</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">the matter that i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">crucial importance when we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">most important problems in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">i like that that we&#39;ve gone everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">specific recommendations on climate</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">change to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.079" style="s2">moral philosophy and i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s so special</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.079" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">about effective altruism</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">is the connection within one community</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">the deep moral questions that will flip</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">you from</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">one cause area to another um</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">and connecting that all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">actual work on the ground where</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">there are people there measuring results</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">in terms of live saved donation</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">money um sent and i think it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">cool because</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">when sahil asked that question i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">sure whether the answer was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">something a little bit more like</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">we helped shaped the thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">the effect of altruism movement and of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">course waves out into the world of other</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">people trying to do good</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">or if it was going to be something a</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">little bit more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">uh yeah thanks i hadn&#39;t hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">thought before about</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">the fact that effective autism is so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">unusual in having such a breadth from</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">like the fundamentals all the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:44.560" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">but certainly when it comes to doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">research it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">i find it very helpful to be engaged</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">with the kind of coal face</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">what are the things that most important</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">and that helps me prioritize within this</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">my research because i can then</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">have a much better sense of like what</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">are the questions that are most</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">important to be answering</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">in order for us actually to be making</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">progress at making the world better</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">and uh i think that&#39;s quite unusual</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">within philosophy where</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">the normal pathway is much more like</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">getting taken by some intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">puzzle or something even</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">uh if it&#39;s not maybe the most practical</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to invite uh auslan bishop</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">to read</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">their question</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">i was just wondering about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">different methodologies that you may</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">have used to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">quantitative and qualitative approach</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">while studying this and also if</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">there&#39;s been efforts or if you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">perhaps created and found places that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">the inventories of all the risks and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">possibilities and effectiveness and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">aspects that you mentioned in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">importance i think the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">ability and you know neglectedness</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">and so forth uh is there a repository</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">along those lines and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">also i was wondering uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">who else might be collaborating and just</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">thinking that uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">un&#39;s initiatives and sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">related goals and so is do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">are you aware of some global</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">coordination systematic</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">and especially quantitative wise</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">uh yeah so it&#39;s a great question uh the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">best resource</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">that i would recommend for everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">toby awards the precipice</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">um it&#39;s a book by a releasing colleague</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:48.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.960" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">and so in terms of cat you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.480" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">uh creating a kind of ranking of global</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:57.200" style="s2">catastrophic risks</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">uh it&#39;s doing this quantitatively</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.200" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">is much easier at least for</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">natural risks such as from asteroid</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">impacts</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">or super volcanoes which are very large</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">volcanoes that have been implicated in</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">previous mass extinctions</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.440" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">uh all kind of natural pathogens as well</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">and you know quantitatively we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">assess that the risks there are very low</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">so perhaps on the order of you know one</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">in um i get like yeah you know one in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">hundred thousand or one in a million</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:33.920" style="s2">over the course of a century</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">um so still be great if they were zero</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.920" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">but um still very low</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">where it gets harder to make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">quantitative estimate is uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">on natural or man-made</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">risks so the risks that we face such as</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">uh like novel viruses because there we</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have a track record</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">so we&#39;re just having to make you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">make guesses make informed expert</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:57.760" style="s2">opinion</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">and uh at least when it comes so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.760" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">other area that we focus on a lot is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">where there&#39;s a worthy that that could</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">be a point of</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">lock-in of a particular set of values at</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">a time once you develop</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">advanced artificial intelligence perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">technological progress goes very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">and whoever controls that is then able</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">to just shape the entire future</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">and there you can start you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:25.599" style="s2">there is work to just try and get better</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">estimates better understandings</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.599" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">such as surveys among experts of when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">should expect to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">artificial intelligence that&#39;s at human</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">level or greater</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.560" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">in terms of its abilities uh where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:40.800" style="s2">typical prediction is saying well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.800" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">uh 40 years um 40 years time</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">uh from if you look if you ask experts</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">and then you can also um look at other</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">you know how much what are the trends</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.440" style="s2">and computational power</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">at what point will we have sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.440" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">amounts of computing power that we could</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">basically simulate a human brain where</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">current ai models</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">um have about the computational power of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">a honeybee</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s still not giving you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">quantitative estimate of the magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">of the risk of the cup</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">of the coming century so there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">to be a judgment call</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">toby has a table in his book where he</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">gives his own personal estimates of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">the size of existential different</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">so he thinks there&#39;s a ten percent</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">existential risk from ai in the coming</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">a three percent um risk from uh man-made</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">viruses</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:45.359" style="s2">and those are the kind of bulk of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">probability um but he&#39;s very very keen</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.359" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">to stress that these are just subjective</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.119" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">estimates it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">bet it&#39;s you know helpful for people in</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">order to understand his views</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">that he&#39;s giving such estimates but uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">claim that it&#39;s not like saying the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">probability of flipping a coin and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">getting a heads is 50</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">where uh you have some notion of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">frequency by which you can make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">the probability</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">uh and then in terms of um collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">with the un</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">uh not yet hopefully one day</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:18.240" style="s2">um if these ideas are gaining more</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">attraction gaining more attention then</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.240" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">yeah something i would love to see is uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">a u.n department that is or organization</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">that is explicitly focused on</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">long-term risks um and the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">events that could</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:39.040" style="s2">uh impart all the future of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">i think for me like after after reading</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">i posted a book review of the precipice</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:47.839" style="s2">from uh slate star codex which i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:49.119" style="s2">is pretty good and it actually has that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.839" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">table there</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.119" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">um that&#39;s where toby ord basically says</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">his rough estimate is like a one in six</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">chance that humanity doesn&#39;t survive the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">century which like</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">to be on a stowa call and hear that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">is making this prediction and then if</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">you do research you realize</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">wow this guy&#39;s actually put a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">work into this there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">people that are actually believing this</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">and like</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">what does that do to you internally in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">terms of setting your own life</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">priorities like</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:24.800" style="s2">i know the old version of me would hear</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">that and it would just sort of like roll</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.800" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">off my back but that&#39;s like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">heavy things to think about um</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m i&#39;m curious if anything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">going to come out of just sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">that if that drives any curiosity for</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">people on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:44.240" style="s2">on this call um so we do have about 10</p>

<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">i saw that your question got a whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">bunch of plus ones so</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">um if you&#39;d like to read that one next</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">yeah thanks um</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">you know i was thinking a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">more about the question i asked before</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">and i said feeling into it a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">um my my driver my thing behind the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">motivation behind it is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">i have a keen interest in human beings</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">developing a better sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:14.240" style="s2">unintended consequences that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">something we&#39;re really bad at</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if there are better</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">ways that we can use collective feedback</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">loops</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">um to explore potential fitness</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">landscape hill climbing</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">um looking at strange attractors and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">really looking at that like</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">the near-term hills seem to be the ones</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:30.640" style="s2">that are most attractive and i would</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">like to expand it ai seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.640" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">something that can move in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">direction there are other things but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">know john verveiki also</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">points at looking at relevance</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">realization and four ways of knowing as</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">a way of developing wisdom to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">to to broaden the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">so um i recognize that my motivation is</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">mostly kind of a meta motivation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">not so much specifically how</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">you would do this but it&#39;s like how can</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">we apply</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">this in a more and a more um broad</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">broadway does that make sense uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">that makes sense and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:06.240" style="s2">um yeah i mean i think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a very promising focus</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.240" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">uh which is kind of improving</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">decision making or you&#39;re just improving</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">society in ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">such that it&#39;s more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">optimized for</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">um you know what&#39;s best in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">even though you haven&#39;t made any like</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">deliberate focus on any one particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">issue but you&#39;ve swept your things such</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">society will make better decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">so i&#39;ll highlight um</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">two two things that i think are um</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">particularly promising there</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">uh one is uh philip tetlock&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">forecasting which we&#39;ve funded quite a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">bit of</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:47.920" style="s2">um where what he has shown</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:50.079" style="s2">is that at least for some people by</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.920" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">making decisive probability judgments to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.079" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">estimate</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">um the size of uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">if you get people to make precise</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">probability judgments to estimate</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">um the likelihood or not of various</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">geopolitical events</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">some people at least are very good at</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">doing this um</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">and are much better than experts um</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">uh who are like not similarly trained um</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">at making such predictions</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">and this is very different from how</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">normal political decision making works</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">which is like it&#39;s both very vague it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">all very qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">people aren&#39;t making kind of precise</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">predictions and certainly not relying on</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">what are called super forecasters people</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">who are very good at making such</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">predictions</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">and so one thing we&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:38.319" style="s2">push on and would like to see more of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">is this just getting built into</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.319" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">government much more um</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">so that governments are now making</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">uh more accurately reflect</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">reality like reasonable probabilities</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">assigned</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">to different year political events</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">uh the second is then on</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:49:00.559" style="s2">you know what governments is what</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">governments you get given a certain set</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.559" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">of voter preferences</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">where the voting reform that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">championed is</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">trying to move us from first past the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">post voting</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">where just you go and you just vote for</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">a single candidate to approval voting</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:14.839" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">you vote for as many candidates as you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.839" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">can and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">uh oh good i&#39;m glad you&#39;re the fan and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">that has just is a tiny change to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">voting system but has</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">mathematically far better properties</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:31.119" style="s2">where it means you avoid vote splitting</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">where perhaps you&#39;ve got you know two</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.119" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">democrats and one republican and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">each democrat gets 30 and the republican</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">gets 40</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">and then wins um that&#39;s like a bad</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">outcome should be</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:42.839" style="s2">even though most people would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">either of the democrats to win a</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:46.640" style="s2">republican</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">so um vote splitting is a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.640" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">aren&#39;t really getting what they want</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">from this voting system um and when</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">surveys have been done it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">representing the will of the people uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:59.520" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a way in which we would</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">end like if this were widely adopted and</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.520" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s had satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">um then the governments that would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">elected</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">are those that would better reflect the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">will of the people and uh that would</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">seem like a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">good thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:23.520" style="s2">thank you and let&#39;s go to pranab</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">with his question hey again</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.520" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">um yeah the i guess the question i had</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">really around the fourth focus area i</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">think i find myself being drawn to it</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">um what are some interesting learnings</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:34.880" style="s2">in how the ea movement has grown over</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.880" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">in this focus area and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">initiatives or approaches have you seen</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:46.240" style="s2">emerge that you didn&#39;t quite expect</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:49.920" style="s2">in getting more people involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.240" end="00:50:52.839" style="s2">uh yes i think the the biggest thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.920" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">is just being surprised at how many</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.839" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">have taken very serious amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.319" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">giving seriously</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">so um when i first</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">uh yeah when i was first thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">setting up giving what we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:11.119" style="s2">uh lots of people were saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">crazy 10 is way too high</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.119" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">um and we just kind of wanted to stick</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">to our guns on that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">um and i really think we were vindicated</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">there and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:20.960" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">how much people are willing to give</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.960" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">and how effectively they&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">give it um</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">and then like whether they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">willing to go out and do other things</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">like change their career and so on</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">and so that means that like these people</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">proportion of people who are just really</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">most committed take these really</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">seriously trying to do the most good</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:40.160" style="s2">just have a really outsized impact</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">because perhaps they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.160" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">giving ten times as much as they would</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">have done and a hundred times more</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">you know they&#39;re having a thousand times</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">the impact that they would otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">have had</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">um and so yeah that&#39;s pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">the fact that such people are just so</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:52:00.160" style="s2">receptive to rational arguments</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:01.920" style="s2">um has also been a big kind of piece of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.160" end="00:52:03.920" style="s2">learning for me where</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">uh if you look at the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.920" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">it uh suggests that what you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">is have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">smiling children and they have these</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">kind of uh or like a single individual</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.079" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">whose story you tell</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to get people to give but</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">those studies have actually just done on</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">very small amounts of money something</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">like 20 cents or 50 cents</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:25.680" style="s2">because otherwise it&#39;d be very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.680" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">the searchers and i think the way people</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">think about very large amount</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">commitments</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:35.200" style="s2">um such as 10 of income it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">extremely different from</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.200" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">how you would make this kind of quick</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">decision when you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">asked like oh hey do you want to give</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">five dollars to this thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">and i think for such a large decision</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">people are much more likely to engage</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:48.480" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">kind of analytical brains and really</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">kind of think through a decision</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">uh then the final thing i&#39;ll say about</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">um things i&#39;ve learned over time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">just the power and importance of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">where we didn&#39;t set out</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">to kind of build an effective community</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">really and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">interesting to see how rapidly and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">organically that grew</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">and now being part of it i can see it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">really makes sense where</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s tough to perhaps be</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:20.559" style="s2">acting in ways that are somewhat more</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">unconventional but such as by giving</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.559" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">significant proportion of your income or</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">making clear changes and it can be scary</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:27.359" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re doing things for</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.359" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">people you will never meet or</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">these causes that seem kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">but having a community of people that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">share your values well that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">rewarding that&#39;s really motivating</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">and i think that helps very</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">significantly with people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">sticking it out longer term</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">thank you thanks will</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking so just as we&#39;re wrapping</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:56.319" style="s2">up i&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">the stoa as its own emerging community</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.319" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">right now and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of people on here</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">that are hoping to change the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">variety of different ways um so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">when i passed things over to peter peter</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering if you&#39;d actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:13.839" style="s2">answer a little bit about like how</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">how are you seeing the stoa community um</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.839" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">and realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:18.079" style="s2">at least from my perspective i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:20.079" style="s2">that there is some influence from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.079" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">effect of altruism community in some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.079" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">the discussions that have happened here</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">um i&#39;m just wondering if you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">touch on that briefly</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">and then and then maybe uh make your</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:30.400" style="s2">final announcements and and will thank</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.400" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">all of this this was fantastic yeah</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m trying to figure out the most</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">strategic way to hop skip</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">around that question i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">answer it right now</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">but i will say that i do take</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:48.799" style="s2">inspiration from will</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:50.799" style="s2">and the ea movement and what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.799" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">done and sort of stole as like an</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">incubator inviting all these different</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:56.000" style="s2">what i call medic tribes in to kind of</p>

<p begin="00:54:56.000" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">uh really and to figure things out and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:02.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">and sometimes your blind spots or your</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.000" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">cognitive biases get exposed by getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">revealed to a radically different</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">philosophy than your own</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of like the space that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">the store is evolving into</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">um so that being said uh thank you</p>
