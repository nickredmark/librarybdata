<p begin="00:00:05.420" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">so many of the people whose thought I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.740" end="00:00:11.700" style="s2">following most closely have have had</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:14.579" style="s2">similar have ended up in a very similar</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.700" end="00:00:17.190" style="s2">place in terms of what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.579" end="00:00:19.110" style="s2">into subjective sense making or how do</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.190" end="00:00:21.590" style="s2">we come into coherence with each other</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.110" end="00:00:23.610" style="s2">to make sense of the world together and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.590" end="00:00:27.140" style="s2">I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.610" end="00:00:29.700" style="s2">why have you ended up in this space and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.140" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">what&#39;s your journey been to get to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.700" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">place I mean I I mean the short answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:39.420" style="s2">is no idea look I think we&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:42.449" style="s2">here and but if I had to kind of attempt</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.420" end="00:00:44.339" style="s2">to assemble some plausible narrative I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.449" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">think it&#39;s just that you know none of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.339" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">live in a vacuum and we all we are all</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:54.749" style="s2">you know intrinsically social creatures</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:56.519" style="s2">and I think there is some you know even</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.749" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">before we get together to talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.519" end="00:01:03.989" style="s2">some shared sense making that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">needed and none of the challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.989" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">at least you know as you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:08.730" style="s2">the people you&#39;re following that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">people who are thinking and writing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.730" end="00:01:13.490" style="s2">speaking and teaching around these</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">things I think it&#39;s all fairly clear</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.490" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">that you know to to to quote cuing long</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">all right where we go one we go all and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">that&#39;s not just batshit dudes on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">hall right that are coming to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">conclusion and I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">why that&#39;s such a resonant rallying cry</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">for that community is he&#39;s not wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">so that sense that we better figure out</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">a none of us have all the pieces and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">better figure out how to share exchange</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">integrate and operationalize all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:49.590" style="s2">pieces almost feels like table stakes</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:51.000" style="s2">assumptions these days so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">of work that I&#39;m familiar with through</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">kind of counseling and trauma work</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:59.220" style="s2">around somatic experiencing polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">theory and it&#39;s all about how we come</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.220" end="00:02:02.760" style="s2">into connection with each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">especially polyvagal theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.760" end="00:02:06.510" style="s2">basically saying that we&#39;re either in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">an exploratory framework where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.510" end="00:02:11.880" style="s2">able and open for connection with others</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">or in a defensive framework and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.880" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">real sense that were</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:19.430" style="s2">is essential to come into a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">broader consciousness maybe into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.430" end="00:02:23.100" style="s2">understanding why conversations break</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">down because we&#39;re in a culture of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.100" end="00:02:26.070" style="s2">moment or the conversation just keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">seeming to break down again and again</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.070" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">and again and this kind of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:36.030" style="s2">like the neurophysiology of coherence or</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">the neurophysiology of connection seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:41.160" style="s2">really vital in that do you what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">take on that yeah I mean I would almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.160" end="00:02:45.390" style="s2">I mean short answer is yes because</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.390" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">tribal primates to be in coherence</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">without that also having a you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">showing up in the kind of stack of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:57.989" style="s2">bodies and brains for sure so for what</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:00.060" style="s2">we want is the ability to have a nice</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.989" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">conversation together the ability for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:03.570" style="s2">to have that nice conversation sits on</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:04.980" style="s2">the foundation all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.570" end="00:03:06.360" style="s2">of bodies and brains and hearts and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.980" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">minds in achievement not whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.360" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">simple things like mirror neurons or</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:13.850" style="s2">it&#39;s more complicated things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">overall neurophysiological resonance</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.850" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">that is for sure another lever for us to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:24.060" style="s2">play with so you know the Business</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">School East sodding in Spain that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">wrote about in a stealing fire the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:33.299" style="s2">that they took a strategic business</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:35.010" style="s2">problem and had a bunch of MBA students</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.299" end="00:03:37.860" style="s2">try and solve it together you know with</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.010" end="00:03:39.000" style="s2">one-way mirrors and biometrics tracking</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.860" end="00:03:40.709" style="s2">them on all this kind of stuff and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">figured I could who are the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.709" end="00:03:45.330" style="s2">leaders in this group and and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.160" style="s2">backed out statistically you know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.330" end="00:03:49.110" style="s2">much people talked how loudly people</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.160" end="00:03:50.850" style="s2">talked the words they used even what</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.110" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">they actually had to say about solving</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.850" end="00:03:55.110" style="s2">the problem none of that stuff was</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">statistically as significant as the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.110" end="00:03:59.130" style="s2">that that those leaders those emergent</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:01.580" style="s2">leaders couldn&#39;t regulate their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.130" end="00:04:04.880" style="s2">nervous systems and do it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.580" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">entrained other people into their states</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.880" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s a little bit like that old story</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:11.190" style="s2">of you know Galileo entering the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.049" style="s2">watchmakers shop and seeing you know all</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.190" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">the all the clocks on the wall swinging</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.049" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">in time with the one with the longest</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">pendulum so that idea of the longest</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:23.310" style="s2">pendulum and trains all the others into</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:25.590" style="s2">that field that to me has been my</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.310" end="00:04:27.580" style="s2">inquiry really on the sort of biohacking</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.590" end="00:04:29.590" style="s2">spaces what&#39;s the longest pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.580" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">our bodies if we had to pick and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.590" end="00:04:34.689" style="s2">a gajillion things we can map track</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">measure from brain waves to heart rate</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.689" end="00:04:38.500" style="s2">to heart rate variability to new</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:41.139" style="s2">chemistry to posture to respiration</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.500" end="00:04:43.090" style="s2">African you know get all sorts but what</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.139" end="00:04:45.490" style="s2">are the one or two or three that if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.090" end="00:04:47.490" style="s2">get those right the entire rest of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.490" end="00:04:50.409" style="s2">bodies and brains cascades into</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.490" end="00:04:52.419" style="s2">coherence and then that&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.409" end="00:04:54.729" style="s2">signal that&#39;s now that&#39;s lengthened our</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.419" end="00:04:57.699" style="s2">pendulum and now we are far more likely</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.729" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">to bring others into that coherent state</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.699" end="00:05:02.349" style="s2">and so before we get to kind of what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:05.139" style="s2">know you might call communitas or like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.349" end="00:05:07.030" style="s2">highly coherent group presencing</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.139" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">something greater than the sum of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.030" end="00:05:12.759" style="s2">parts my sense is that when we try we</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:15.460" style="s2">get there occasionally particularly from</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.759" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">a shed peak state or experience we kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.460" end="00:05:19.060" style="s2">of experience a bit but then it comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:20.940" style="s2">undone it is unstable and it breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.060" end="00:05:23.979" style="s2">and it you know it&#39;s almost a truism</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.940" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">that it breaks down because of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.979" end="00:05:28.210" style="s2">trauma</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:30.250" style="s2">I have ego based stuff personality stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.210" end="00:05:32.289" style="s2">I&#39;ve lived a story where I&#39;m I&#39;m either</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.360" end="00:05:39.490" style="s2">and at some point in the game somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.719" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">hits a few wrong notes things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.490" end="00:05:46.150" style="s2">unspooling and we all go back into our</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.159" end="00:05:56.279" style="s2">if it&#39;s ever dealt with it all often</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not is verbal linguistic</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.470" end="00:14:17.220" style="s2">subjects so the question is is can we</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.779" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">create catharsis right the except the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.220" end="00:14:22.029" style="s2">metabolizing of our trauma the digesting</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.170" end="00:14:46.630" style="s2">and from there can we learn to play this</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.500" end="00:14:48.250" style="s2">bigger game together and if we sit if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.630" end="00:14:50.650" style="s2">only have words to talk about it never</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.250" end="00:14:54.070" style="s2">gonna get done if we have access to</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.670" end="00:15:03.940" style="s2">little bit more skillfully with much</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.140" end="00:15:12.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve written a question here is identity</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.980" end="00:16:10.279" style="s2">on earth do we get to global centric</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.269" end="00:16:11.750" style="s2">consciousness at scale and the only</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.769" end="00:16:32.990" style="s2">that part you think okay well what about</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.230" end="00:16:34.759" style="s2">the little blue marble the flyover</p>

<p begin="00:16:34.759" end="00:16:38.689" style="s2">familiar with like the Apollo astronauts</p>

<p begin="00:17:03.769" end="00:17:08.650" style="s2">gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.309" end="00:17:11.270" style="s2">so can we instead of being astronauts to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.650" end="00:17:13.780" style="s2">precipitate that flyover effect of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.270" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">global centric perspective can we become</p>

<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:34.549" style="s2">to do that but the lead the lead anchors</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.990" end="00:17:37.309" style="s2">present preventing that is our</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:24.860" style="s2">encapsulated you go move beyond my</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.830" end="00:18:27.830" style="s2">stories move beyond seeking pleasure and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.860" end="00:18:29.510" style="s2">avoiding pain to play a bigger game by</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.510" end="00:18:36.530" style="s2">with others and if we can get there then</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.260" end="00:18:38.510" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ve got a shot you know and just</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.530" end="00:18:39.890" style="s2">before when we were talking about kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.510" end="00:18:41.809" style="s2">of coming into coherence with each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.890" end="00:18:44.980" style="s2">you talked about neuro neuro</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.809" end="00:18:47.990" style="s2">physiological resets what what are those</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.980" end="00:18:49.400" style="s2">yeah well I mean and this is the this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.990" end="00:18:51.940" style="s2">the research I&#39;m doing for my next book</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.400" end="00:18:54.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s basically the idea of again you</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.940" end="00:18:55.910" style="s2">can do all sorts of things in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.200" end="00:18:58.610" style="s2">you can do all sorts of things with 10</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.910" end="00:19:00.740" style="s2">million dollars in a kit and a fancy</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.610" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">retreat center or a research project or</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.740" end="00:19:05.210" style="s2">you know or you know Dafa you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:08.390" style="s2">of you know multi-year study or</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.210" end="00:19:12.800" style="s2">something my interest is in what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.390" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">cheap to free what is open source</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.800" end="00:19:16.940" style="s2">meaning almost everybody who would want</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:18.800" style="s2">to can have access to it and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.940" end="00:19:22.820" style="s2">scalable kind of the first to you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.800" end="00:19:24.770" style="s2">put into gear and so if you take a look</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.820" end="00:19:27.170" style="s2">at I think you can kind of run a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.770" end="00:19:28.670" style="s2">straightforward thought experiment which</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.170" end="00:19:30.350" style="s2">is you&#39;re like okay well if it has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.670" end="00:19:32.450" style="s2">mean all those things it probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.350" end="00:19:33.830" style="s2">already exists in our bodies or you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.450" end="00:19:35.420" style="s2">we either carry around with us or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.830" end="00:19:38.780" style="s2">simple protocols we can adopt with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.420" end="00:19:41.860" style="s2">minimum of tools and spend and you also</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.780" end="00:19:45.340" style="s2">think okay what are the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.860" end="00:19:49.700" style="s2">evolutionarily encoded because if we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.340" end="00:19:53.660" style="s2">judo flip those things to higher better</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.700" end="00:19:54.830" style="s2">uses we have a real chance of what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.660" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">just got to let them you want a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.820" end="00:20:37.779" style="s2">oxygen in your tank still at that time</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.139" end="00:20:39.970" style="s2">what you have had is an excessive carbon</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.070" end="00:21:59.529" style="s2">our route and it modulates much of our</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.419" end="00:22:08.230" style="s2">you can hyperventilate or do other</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.400" end="00:22:57.040" style="s2">yeah if you find yourself in an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.490" end="00:22:59.560" style="s2">to have a coherent conversation meaning</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.900" end="00:23:05.050" style="s2">if we play it right something better</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.050" end="00:23:08.290" style="s2">thought of let&#39;s say that&#39;s the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.290" end="00:23:14.410" style="s2">things start to go sideways right</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.810" end="00:23:17.170" style="s2">somebody gets hijacked somebody starts</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.690" end="00:23:23.230" style="s2">react you know that&#39;s what we&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.890" end="00:23:24.340" style="s2">right there the first moment is you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.230" end="00:23:25.960" style="s2">this this is man&#39;s search for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.340" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">right it&#39;s that it&#39;s the stimulus in the</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:40.510" style="s2">wisdom 101 which is if you&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:41.830" style="s2">get angry or say something off the cuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.510" end="00:23:43.510" style="s2">take a deep breath</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.830" end="00:23:46.390" style="s2">it actually takes several deep breaths</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.510" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">and specifically engage in you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.390" end="00:23:51.550" style="s2">freedivers called vagal tone breathing</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.790" end="00:23:54.700" style="s2">which is just the idea of act like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.550" end="00:23:56.830" style="s2">ten-second exhale with a two-second hold</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.700" end="00:23:58.300" style="s2">so exhale fully empty your lungs</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.830" end="00:24:00.730" style="s2">once your lungs are completely empty</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.300" end="00:24:02.170" style="s2">hold them for two seconds and then just</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.730" end="00:24:04.510" style="s2">fill your lungs and you can do that at a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.170" end="00:24:06.130" style="s2">table you don&#39;t need to announce it you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.510" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">can just actually use that and just take</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.130" end="00:24:11.730" style="s2">five of those and you will match it in</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:13.540" style="s2">fact if you do it a friend of ours as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.730" end="00:24:15.610" style="s2">neuroscientist at Stanford his name&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.540" end="00:24:17.620" style="s2">Andrew Huberman and he&#39;s done a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.610" end="00:24:19.420" style="s2">fascinating research where if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.620" end="00:24:21.310" style="s2">combine I games so if you kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.420" end="00:24:23.980" style="s2">soft focus meaning that you&#39;re focusing</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.310" end="00:24:26.650" style="s2">your eyes to the outside of your frame</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.980" end="00:24:29.260" style="s2">and you do that vagal nerve breathing so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.650" end="00:24:30.820" style="s2">the super slow exhales a whole you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.260" end="00:24:33.940" style="s2">and you do it through your nose</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.820" end="00:24:36.820" style="s2">you completely draw your physiological</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.940" end="00:24:39.730" style="s2">threat response you just chill the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.820" end="00:24:41.020" style="s2">out super fast and so that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.730" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">simplest and people might think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.020" end="00:24:44.650" style="s2">just kind of spaced out or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:47.080" style="s2">there but yeah if you can just go soft</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.650" end="00:24:48.100" style="s2">soft I focus so you&#39;re not laser focused</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.080" end="00:24:49.929" style="s2">and you&#39;re not focused on something</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.100" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">immediately in front of you and you do</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.929" end="00:24:56.530" style="s2">nitrogen basically nasal exhales then</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:59.230" style="s2">that will really calm you down further</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.530" end="00:25:02.260" style="s2">the next would be and part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.230" end="00:25:04.990" style="s2">for the nose breathing the Carolyn&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.260" end="00:25:07.240" style="s2">Karolinska Institute in Sweden has done</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.990" end="00:25:10.570" style="s2">some fascinating research on the nitric</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.240" end="00:25:12.070" style="s2">oxide and that correlates with some</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.570" end="00:25:13.870" style="s2">research at Harvard that basically said</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.070" end="00:25:15.730" style="s2">nitric oxide is a neurotransmitter and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.870" end="00:25:18.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a gaseous molecule and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.730" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">stress response stuff out of our brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.010" end="00:25:23.080" style="s2">it shunts it all the way and it brings</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:24.669" style="s2">in feelings of you know bliss if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.080" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">call it the Bliss molecule right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.669" end="00:25:29.140" style="s2">basically anything you can do in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:31.090" style="s2">body to increase nitric oxide is usually</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.140" end="00:25:32.410" style="s2">a good thing for stress response and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.090" end="00:25:34.510" style="s2">resilience alright so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.410" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">Harvard research then the Karolinska</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.510" end="00:25:39.040" style="s2">Institute has found that nasal breathing</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:41.040" style="s2">increases it three to five times and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.040" end="00:25:43.780" style="s2">that if you really want to get freaky</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.040" end="00:25:45.460" style="s2">vibrating your nasal cavity as you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.780" end="00:25:46.750" style="s2">breathe out through your nose so hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.460" end="00:25:48.100" style="s2">something like that or if you were</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.750" end="00:25:50.169" style="s2">playing a didgeridoo or playing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.100" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">clarinet or a trombone that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.169" end="00:25:55.570" style="s2">increases nitric oxide production 15</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.020" end="00:26:21.910" style="s2">and it will have some positive effect</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.059" end="00:26:24.220" style="s2">the next is now a bridge what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.910" end="00:26:27.970" style="s2">bridge between the neurophysiology and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.220" end="00:26:29.740" style="s2">psychology right so Lisa Feldman Barrett</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.970" end="00:26:32.770" style="s2">who just recently wrote a book called</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.770" end="00:26:36.820" style="s2">upended the field of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:37.040" style="s2">neuroscience and causation unlike what</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.690" end="00:26:42.380" style="s2">have you people have probably heard</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.130" end="00:26:43.550" style="s2">these stories of like the smile muscles</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.380" end="00:26:44.600" style="s2">and all the micro muscles around the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.550" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">face in the eyes and different</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.600" end="00:26:49.940" style="s2">combinations and different micro muscles</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">equals certain emotions and her pushback</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.940" end="00:26:52.460" style="s2">was actually like hey a lot of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:54.530" style="s2">more culturally constructed than you</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.460" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">think if you go to Asia what is a smile</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.530" end="00:26:57.800" style="s2">what&#39;s a slight upturn that can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:59.540" style="s2">cynicism that could be suck that could</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.800" end="00:27:01.340" style="s2">be actually absolute joy but that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.540" end="00:27:03.560" style="s2">the most we actually display of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.340" end="00:27:06.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole host of cultural layers</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.560" end="00:27:07.670" style="s2">of how we&#39;re taught to emote starting</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.200" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">with mirror neurons babies and mothers</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.670" end="00:27:12.610" style="s2">so her point is actually emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.510" style="s2">way more plastic fungible</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.610" end="00:27:16.760" style="s2">context-dependent than we might have</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.510" end="00:27:20.600" style="s2">thought there&#39;s really only four things</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.760" end="00:27:23.540" style="s2">we feel we feel positive or negative not</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.600" end="00:27:25.580" style="s2">surprise active or passive so if I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.540" end="00:27:28.130" style="s2">negative passive that might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.580" end="00:27:31.310" style="s2">depression if I was negative active that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.130" end="00:27:34.520" style="s2">might be anger if I was active positive</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.310" end="00:27:36.530" style="s2">that might be joy if I was active if I</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.520" end="00:27:39.710" style="s2">thought it was positive passive that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.530" end="00:27:41.900" style="s2">might be contentment so that&#39;s the jam</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.710" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">there&#39;s just four ways we tend to feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.900" end="00:27:45.710" style="s2">and she calls it interior Inception</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:48.170" style="s2">meaning that before I even have an</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.710" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">emotion which we usually we usually</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.170" end="00:27:52.970" style="s2">think of in terms of our psychology like</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:56.600" style="s2">I am happy I am sad even intransitive</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.970" end="00:27:58.070" style="s2">though I equals made that emotion she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.600" end="00:28:00.740" style="s2">saying it&#39;s happening at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.070" end="00:28:02.450" style="s2">our organs of our nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.740" end="00:28:04.820" style="s2">literally at the level of our bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.450" end="00:28:08.360" style="s2">brains know just they&#39;re just in those</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.820" end="00:28:11.510" style="s2">states and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.360" end="00:28:13.880" style="s2">research has also found is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.510" end="00:28:17.990" style="s2">have that interior receptive response</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.880" end="00:28:19.640" style="s2">you can actually overwrite it so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.990" end="00:28:21.650" style="s2">actually at that moment of choice I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.640" end="00:28:24.800" style="s2">having one of those four feelings now</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.650" end="00:28:27.110" style="s2">out of my memory bank of words that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.800" end="00:28:29.240" style="s2">represent emotions which one do I pull</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.110" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">off the shelf and say I am sad I am</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.240" end="00:28:33.850" style="s2">happy I&#39;m excited I&#39;m nervous and what</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:37.280" style="s2">they have found is that you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.850" end="00:28:40.820" style="s2">overwrite and nudge by the word you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.280" end="00:28:42.740" style="s2">choose to pick so sort of DIY neuro</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.820" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">linguistic programming so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.740" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">about to get on you know up on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:49.410" style="s2">diving blocks for a swimming race anyway</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:50.940" style="s2">my god oh my god I&#39;m shaking right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.410" end="00:28:53.070" style="s2">feeling something</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.940" end="00:28:55.410" style="s2">I&#39;m having an interior septic response</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.070" end="00:28:58.140" style="s2">I&#39;m actually still at a moment of choice</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.410" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">and if you if you lay in you prime</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.140" end="00:29:03.900" style="s2">yourself by saying I am excited right</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:06.290" style="s2">and you actually repeat that several</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.900" end="00:29:09.710" style="s2">times you will actually move into</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.290" end="00:29:12.120" style="s2">positive active instead of negative</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.710" end="00:29:14.130" style="s2">active if you say I am nervous I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.120" end="00:29:17.460" style="s2">scared that then you will reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.130" end="00:29:20.760" style="s2">those things so we have a chance which</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.460" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">is when like a no just even just</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.760" end="00:29:24.059" style="s2">awareness there&#39;s this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.770" style="s2">interior section and it precedes our</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.059" end="00:29:27.900" style="s2">emotions and we&#39;re actually some and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.770" end="00:29:30.420" style="s2">more at choice on the emotions we feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.900" end="00:29:32.910" style="s2">than we might have thought and that by</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.420" end="00:29:35.610" style="s2">choosing positive you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.910" end="00:29:37.530" style="s2">neuro-linguistic priming for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.610" end="00:29:39.990" style="s2">we can help shift that so if we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.470" end="00:30:39.480" style="s2">I can nip it in the bud before I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.570" end="00:30:41.670" style="s2">named it as a destructive or a reactive</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.690" end="00:30:56.700" style="s2">bit of practice I can speak that truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.820" end="00:30:58.440" style="s2">into the shared conversation and quite</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.409" end="00:31:08.610" style="s2">for saying that and then we&#39;re back to</p>
