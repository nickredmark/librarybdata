<p begin="00:00:06.160" end="00:00:09.519" style="s2">uh narration about this issue of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:12.320" style="s2">rationality how</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.519" end="00:00:14.080" style="s2">uh you know sort of the foundationalists</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.320" end="00:00:16.240" style="s2">the rationalists are thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.080" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">and how we need to break out of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.240" end="00:00:19.840" style="s2">and then how as you lean into that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:22.480" style="s2">start to intersect with faith</p>

<p begin="00:00:24.160" end="00:00:29.119" style="s2">conversation about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">yeah well i can certainly give you a</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.119" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">snippet of where i&#39;m coming from and</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:35.920" style="s2">complementing each other here so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">know my life&#39;s work one way to frame my</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.920" end="00:00:38.320" style="s2">life&#39;s works is on the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:40.239" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.320" end="00:00:41.760" style="s2">okay so the problem of psychology i</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.239" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">actually did a blog went a little viral</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:44.480" style="s2">on it just recently was</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">we should know about the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.480" end="00:00:47.440" style="s2">psychology and the way we know about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:50.079" style="s2">problem of quantum gravity</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.440" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">okay and what i mean by that is everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.079" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">should be aware</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">that the field of psychology has</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:57.680" style="s2">struggled forever is try to define</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:59.359" style="s2">what the hell it is as a science of okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.680" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">and to this day it remains is it a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.359" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">science of mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:04.720" style="s2">is it science of behavior or is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">science of some combination in therein</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.720" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">and there is no language system that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">allows you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">to clarify what is meant by a science of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">say mind and behavior that&#39;s the normal</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">blending all right and we should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">really conscious of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">um you know not to make a pun on words</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">here okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s right quite remarkable i</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">mean we&#39;ve known this since 1927</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">led vygotsky really nails it and uh it</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">calls it the crisis of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">um never been resolved and it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">to me it&#39;s at the foundation of what i</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">call the enlightenment gap</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">the enlightenment gaps the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">inability to develop</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">a language system that&#39;s coherent enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">uh to define</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">the necessary terms in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:47.360" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">so that we get coherence and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.360" end="00:01:50.079" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">system is about i&#39;m you know what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.079" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">working on is the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">and mind mind mind problem okay and what</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">i mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:59.119" style="s2">you have to sort out what is behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:02.320" style="s2">and then there&#39;s actually three</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">different definitions of mind that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.320" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.040" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">disentangled uh for you to actually have</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">a language system that then</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">has the appropriate references and when</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">you do that then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">the field uh becomes much less tangled</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">and you start to be able to talk with</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">so the uh how this</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">and how this dialogues and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">greg and i are doing in each episode</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">dialogues with the uh what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">is we uh there&#39;s a long argument there</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">in sort of uh structure to what went on</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">an awakening from the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">there&#39;s first of all historical analysis</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">of how did we get to the culture of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">cognitive grammar that has made</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">this aspect of ourselves that is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">familiar and personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">so deeply deeply problematic and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">first of all take a look at sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">cartesian arguments</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">and the main point there is um</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">the the what&#39;s called the mind body</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">problem the problem of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">consciousness and our material existence</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:05.120" style="s2">our physical existence is better said by</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.120" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">than material um is enmeshed it is woven</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">together with</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">and is inseparable from the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">cognitive grammar of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">revolution i made similar arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">awakening for the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">and then expanding that out um and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">and then so how that problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">right what greg referred to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">generation of uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:32.319" style="s2">of of the world view of modernity uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">became then a mesh into what greg calls</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.319" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">the problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">is our endeavor to do a lot more work at</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">setting up</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">the problem formulating the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">consciousness really clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">and what comes out of that is there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">there are two issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">that tend to be separated in</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">professional academic discourse about</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">consciousness there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">the generation or nature question</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">which is how does something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">consciousness be how does it have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">place within</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">the physical world as described by</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">science like how does</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">one way of putting that although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">always it&#39;s also everything you say</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">about consciousness is contentious</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">is how does consciousness emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">um and greg and i are and this is how it</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">also meshes with craig&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">uh part of the argument there is you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that question is ill-posed we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">should be asking a deeper question</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">of you know how does life emerge out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">non-life</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">um how does sentience emerge out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">animate life and then how does</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">consciousness relate</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s much more of a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">question than the stark contrast</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">and then that is put into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">the other question which is well what</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">does consciousness do</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">i mean for descartes there was no</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">question but because because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">pre-freud</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">and pre-chomsky but given that most of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">our intelligent behavior doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">require consciousness what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">does for us that&#39;s the function question</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">the point is we have theories</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">cognitive scientific neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">theories that tend to address one</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">one of these questions the nature</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">or the function question but not the two</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">together part part of the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">i&#39;m presenting and greg is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">uh helping me with is that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">also a fundamental mistake of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">the two questions are deeply integrated</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">and although it&#39;s harder</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">we have to try and frame them and answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">them in an integrated fashion and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a long argument about that but</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">the main idea is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:35.880" style="s2">that the function of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">is to do uh to to do what i call</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.880" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">um aspectualization is out of all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">i zero in on the relevant subset of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">how they&#39;re relevant to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">how they&#39;re relevant to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">and although i have to say that in three</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">ways those are all just one relevance</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">realization package</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">so right now this is a phone but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">could be a weapon</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">it could be a platform right and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:06.039" style="s2">i&#39;m always aspectualizing and then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.039" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">aspectualization which um is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">basically a process in which relevance</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">salient in the sense that it&#39;s arousing</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">investment of your time and your energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">as specialization</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">is what makes so your brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">as a your body brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">as a physical thing has co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">world right it has mental states that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">reliably co-vary</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">and that can actually explain a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">your even unconscious behavior</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">reliable covariation the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">covariation and this is a standard issue</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">is that covariation isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">the precision of representation right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">the thing in the world that&#39;s co-varying</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">with this is it covering with it as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">phone</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">as a tool as an object as a platform as</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">a potential weapon</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">as a thing given to me on my birthday</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">etc right and so and this act this idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">actually comes from descartes many</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">people don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">know this what consciousness does is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">takes the reliable co-variations that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">give us our root america rudimentary</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">intelligence our ability to respond</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">in a reliable reliably discriminatory</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">variable fashion with the variations of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">the world and what it does is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">aspectualizes them for us</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">and when they&#39;re asked spectralized</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">they&#39;re now ready for reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">they&#39;re ready for and i&#39;m meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">very broadly and greg is being</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">charitable with me on that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">right uh i i love the frame i can frank</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">you know what</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">i love it yeah no right and so um</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">the idea is that that&#39;s one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">functions of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">uh consciousness that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">consciousness is so needed</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">in situations where we&#39;re facing novelty</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">or ambiguity because aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">is needed</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">and what i can show and i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">do it here because there&#39;s too much not</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">enough time</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">is most of the functional accounts that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">i made this argument elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">most of the current functional accounts</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">of consciousness actually converge on</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">this idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:08.120" style="s2">of consciousness is this kind of higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">order relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.120" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">aspectualization that readies us for</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">in a powerful way now what that also</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">gives i would argue is it also starts to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">explain the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">why well what does a spectralization</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">give you well it gives you what i call</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:29.199" style="s2">the adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">it gives you the hereness and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.199" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">nowness</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">and the togetherness the adverbial</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">and the problem that has sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">hamstrung</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">a lot of discourse about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">is that we over focus on the adjectival</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:44.399" style="s2">the greenness the blueness and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.399" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">what it and what and i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">say that those aren&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">consciousness of course they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:52.800" style="s2">but the adverbial qualia are actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">qualia</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.800" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">and they can actually be so they&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">of consciousness it&#39;s what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">but they are directly explicable in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">terms of the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">now what might that do for you well it</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">might help to account for the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">that you can actually have states of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">consciousness in which there are no</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">adjectival qualia</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">you can be in the pure conscious event</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">that&#39;s achieved indeed</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">but what doesn&#39;t go away are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">the hereness and the noun that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">like the these</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">these states are described with</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">superlatives of hereness and nowness</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">eternity and unity ultimate togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">so the adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">are seem to be both necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">for consciousness and that that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">um there&#39;s more to this i&#39;m just giving</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">you a gist</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">now what this ultimately leads to is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">this idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">you have participatory knowing that set</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">up the reliable covariation</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">and generate affordances and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:56.959" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">right this higher order relevance</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">that is right that is doing the aspect</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">realization and that gives me my</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">perspective knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">and consciousness is my participatory</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">of and through my perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">when i&#39;m conscious i&#39;m not only what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">it like it&#39;s also who i am</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">i know i&#39;m conscious by being conscious</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">and so i&#39;m trying to give an account</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">that in an integrated fashion explains</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">and the phenomenality of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">and it also helps to explain a deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">that is presupposed but never addressed</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">through all of this literature</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">that we attribute consciousness where we</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">where we have evidence for intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">people reliably do that well here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">reason why because there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">continuity and functional relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">between the relevance realization that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">gets the covariation going</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">and the higher order relevance</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">realization that aspectualizes that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">and readies it for reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">boom that&#39;s it and that of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">everything i said</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">pretty much every single sentence needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">argument and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">and what greg and i are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">unpacking the argument and the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">right nice so yeah for me that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">all of that fits uh it all fits in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">unified theory frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">uh it and so what john is doing so so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">i said there are three different really</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">meanings of the word mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">mental process okay so one meeting what</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">i call mind one</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">uh that&#39;s a neurocognitive functional</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">of mental behavior i&#39;ll say that again</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">it&#39;s a neurocognitive functional account</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">of mental behavior so what you do there</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">is you see an animal behaving</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">i got fish over there i go up i feed</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">them every time i feed them they get all</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">excited</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">okay why well there&#39;s a classical and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">opera and associative relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">and i can analyze the hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">structure of their nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">relate it to the contingencies of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">environment and analyze the animal</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">behavioral patterns in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">where the cognitive refers to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">information instantiated within the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">and the mental over mental behavior</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">refers to what i see so that&#39;s a pure</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">science externalized view okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s what some people mean when</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">they talk about mind it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the neurocognitive structure that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">are regulating controlling behavior</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s one definition and you then</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">divide it up into all the stuff inside</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">the informational architecture and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">how it&#39;s regulating the stuff outside</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">that&#39;s between the animal and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">environment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">what i call mental behavior because you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">have to have that actual specifier</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">because atoms behave cells behave but</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">they don&#39;t behave as mental entities</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">okay then what you get is mind two of an</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">emergent function</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">which is essentially conscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">phenomenology what john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">theory is of is of the processes by</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">uh that neurocognitive architecture</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:57.760" style="s2">comes together engages in perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">and participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s mind two now mind two is funky</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">okay and really challenging especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:07.560" style="s2">in the language of science</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">because it&#39;s you can&#39;t see it right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.560" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">epistemologically contained</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">unlike mind one which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:13.360" style="s2">epistemologically available from a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">science perspective</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">mind two is epistemologically across uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">the gap of first and second person</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s a nightmare and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why science is fucking</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">tumbled over but then you get mine three</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">okay mind three is human justification</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">we just listened to john&#39;s mind three</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">give us a narrative about his theory of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">right now the cool thing about mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">three is that goes between across the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">skin without a boundary</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">all right so the information contained</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">in my head as i talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:46.399" style="s2">and through my skin so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">intersubjectively available</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.399" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">from interior exterior positions so mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">is available through the exterior and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">its classic neurocognitive behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">mind two is phenomenology consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">and then how does that work which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">john&#39;s fundamental theory and actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">lines right up with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">unified theory with enormous specificity</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">and precision and john&#39;s got some</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">brilliant insight that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">adjectival versus adverbial shift my</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">mind went boom when i saw it</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">mine just did i mean when you just</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">brought it up first time i heard that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">i was like oh my god it&#39;s the witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">function and what you&#39;re witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">together and you split those things and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">then you can have a pure consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">event as you find in meditation which</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:23.199" style="s2">means then the qualia go away but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">still present with the hereness now and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.199" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s boom you know so now you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.199" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">actually then hone in you split that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">thing off and my whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">the first thing i stumbled on in 1996</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">was the justification</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">hypothesis and theory which is what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">the mind three</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">what is the fundamental organization of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">human mind three you guys were talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">about rationality last time and i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">to jump in there and say</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">hey actually guys use justification and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">then split it across personal and social</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">and analytic</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">and you will be able to manage your</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">rationality narrative there</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">um that&#39;s another conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">anyway mind three is a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">ball game</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">because it cuts right through the skin</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">so we got to divide up</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">mind three mind two mind one and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">there&#39;s another argument for what</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">behavior is but</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">you do that we start talking with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">level of specificity and clarity</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">uh that&#39;s never been achieved and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">and the implications of that are hard to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">overstate</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">so we probably i hope jordan we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">you have an amazing capacity to take a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">lot of complex information</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">um but i hope that wasn&#39;t like right but</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">we&#39;re geeking out here so we&#39;ll shut up</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">no that was great yeah it was fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">i liked all of it um</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">um no yeah so so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">and it&#39;ll take me a little while i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">to there&#39;s some eddies</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">like the the adjective adverb um</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">that i can feel them already doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">i am changing as a consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">that was a new thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s real like it&#39;s a good thing um</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">and just for i just like to flag uh the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">the the debatable</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">move that i think is consistently</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">showing up here that is so powerful you</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">need specificity and clarity like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">disambiguation it&#39;s like hey guys</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">a lot of the problem here is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">just the grammar a lot of the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">that is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">is the things we&#39;re using to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">to figure stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">let&#39;s slow down let&#39;s get the tools in</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">order let&#39;s get things clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">once we get to clarity a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">problems go away and those that don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">away we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">now begin to dress um</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s really interesting and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">was noticing greg i just had in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.399" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">it popped into my mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">as you&#39;re talking at that last step um</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">systems of justification the the visual</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">image of the tree</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s of course three you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">the trunk</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s all this is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:41.199" style="s2">the context of still the deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">fundamental connectedness to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.199" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">of real</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">and the way the whole of real is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">coming up in these stacks right so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">got this</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">mind three which is sitting in mesh in</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">mind too which is sitting in machine</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">line one which is sitting and meshed in</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">you know all the way down to then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">reality and fully constrained by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">constraints that give rise to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">being a coherent structure all the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">up and then it has its own novel</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">or specifics of what it&#39;s doing in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">that environment it opens up a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">adjacent possibles</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">when you shift into that language or</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">different information processing</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">right with that yeah so one one</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">argument in fact about the uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">one of the new theories and again i</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.039" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">won&#39;t go i&#39;m not going to try and burden</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">people because</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">greg and i are going to unpack this in</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:29.919" style="s2">detail but one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">most recent um and promising theories of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.919" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">the function of consciousness um doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">agrees with that the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">consciousness is this aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">um and but they also bring out</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">an important uh well i&#39;m sorry i was</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">gonna i realized it was funny they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">gonna bring out an important aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">the aspect realization</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">uh but what&#39;s that aspect um and here</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:55.080" style="s2">this is even tightening this idea about</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">reading it for reason i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.080" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">aspectualization is what turns</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">co-variations into representations</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.640" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">and representations through their</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">specificity can become truth bearers</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s needed for reason but what</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">aspect realization also does</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">and what consciousness seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">specifically needed for</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">is dealing with counter factuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">unconscious cognition doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">able to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">counter factuals right and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">what you&#39;re getting in the readiness or</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">reason is of course you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">representations which are truth bearers</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">right but there are unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">representations</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">but when they are aspectualized such</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">that they can enter into counter factual</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">consideration</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">then you have genuine readiness for</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">reason now of course that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">just be adaptively important</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">and of course when you recurse that on</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">yourself you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">a needed capacity for self-correction</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">because self-correction presupposes</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">i should have done x which is a counter</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">factual</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">right so i&#39;ll just add a quick comment</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">to that so</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">just so you were tracking here so when</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">he says ready for reason uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">talking still at an animal level</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">and for me then we&#39;re actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">then about okay ready for simulation</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">across possible paths of investment and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">that&#39;s where the counterfactual will</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">come up so you&#39;re sort of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">i can now hold and by the way this then</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">connects into what&#39;s called working</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">uh perspectival working memory so how</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">does the thing hold</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">and then run through various simulations</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">of possibility and then make comparison</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">relationship to possible passive</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">investment and create a cost-benefit</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">analysis of the affordances that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">want to then track</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">okay so then what happens is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">happening at the mammal level</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">okay or birds a lot you know where</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">exactly is and all that&#39;s super crazy in</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">the animal world but essentially that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">right and then actually i want to then</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">say yeah and then there&#39;s an extra ready</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">for reason that we do when we actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">start talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">right which then said well how the hell</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">do you know you&#39;re not bullshitting me</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">you know it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">yes there we are right and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">sort of like now i&#39;m going to justify</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">now it&#39;s like why do you you know now</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">you have propositional language</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">actually tracking the simulation right</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">and then you have the question of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">proposition</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">now you have propositional knowledge on</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">top of perspectival participatory</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">and then exactly right so so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">talking about as i understand it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">something along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">of the the location in justification</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">justification space of what we might</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">call reason two</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">yeah yeah yep exactly yeah so which</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">within the mind three kind of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">versus mind two kind of reasoning right</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">which is simulation</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">we do that all the time you imagine you</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">simulate various outcomes right</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s not necessarily propositional</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:30.640" style="s2">then you get into propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">okay and then what you what we got was</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">initially personal</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">and social indigenous justification and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">then when we get in the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">formal and most notably socrates you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">actually get formal analytic</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">epistemological justification which</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">well how do you know you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">fucking bullshitting it&#39;s like is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:46.559" style="s2">here&#39;s math mathematical truths are like</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:48.320" style="s2">this that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.559" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">that&#39;s deductive truths do we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.320" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">deductive truth systems that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">actually moving or we&#39;re all just making</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">this up a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">uh for our social needs and then now all</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">saying get philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">boom real uh ah</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">so this implies by the way how neat i</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.960" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">believe that we just hit uh we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">did this implies that when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">achieved a particular level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">distributed</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">cognition that you&#39;ve achieved the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">capacity to actually have distributed</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">yes you will also have witnessed the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">emergence of shared consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">yeah you have to be that i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">a whole bunch of new age people just had</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">a very weird feeling but yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:31.360" style="s2">not that one dude not not that one</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">no no no we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re talking right</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.360" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">we&#39;re playing jazz here folks you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">that kind of that&#39;s like that&#39;s you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">disambigue you can debibilize that what</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">i just said is exactly what is implied</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">just now you have to grasp it with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">right i think your point about so this</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:46.159" style="s2">is actually you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">your debibilization thing resonates</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">enormously to me that&#39;s what i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">fucking obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">because in 1990s i realized i was i was</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">equivocating i love john&#39;s word about</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">quibbling</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">equivocation yeah i was really i</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">realized that i was like i was getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">driven by something crazy and i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">have the word equivocate but that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">the issue</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know what i was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">i&#39;d listen to other people and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what the hell they were</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">talking about i mean they knew within</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:06.880" style="s2">their little frames but the frames</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t line up so they&#39;re arguing about</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t be corresponded to each</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">other so it&#39;s like what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">you know so anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s been my</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">obsession for a long damn time</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s sorry i want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">you&#39;re done great because i know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">i&#39;m done</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re also my friend and i want</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">to make sure that i i i</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">know yeah you don&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">your friend me brother</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">so about that about shared consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">dan chappie and i are doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">work on this because</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">about the rovers on mars and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">scientists working together to move the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">rovers around</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s where a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">about uh participatory perspective</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">really comes to the fore but let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s move into that carefully</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">because i don&#39;t want to make the new</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">agers happy</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">uh but i do want to perhaps make us</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">ready for the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">uh paradigmatic place uh so uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:05.520" style="s2">so let&#39;s take take a look at what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">were saying about notice</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.520" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">you know how we use these two terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">we sort of had awareness of the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">perception and then we had imagination</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">and we talked about working memory here</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">but the thing that we&#39;re now realizing</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">in cognitive sciences</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">those are not we sort of think of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">as different</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">but they&#39;re actually interwoven like</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">this right</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">then this is all what&#39;s going on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">called predictive process</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">imagination is just the it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">top down</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">aspect of realization and perception is</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">just the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">aspect of it and you can pull them apart</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">uh in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">but notice how consciousness is bridging</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">because when i&#39;m doing this on the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">i&#39;m conscious</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">but when i&#39;m doing this in my head you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">know what i still am conscious</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">and consciousness is exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">bridging right that allow</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re right we&#39;re bringing into</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">sort of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">cognitive awareness the the way we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.840" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">play with the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">top down and the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">of aspectualization now something</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">analogous to that i think can go on</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">and i i i i want to be really</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">clear that i&#39;m making an analogy here</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">something can go on in what is called</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">you know the social imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">the the kind of shared um</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about this the paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">images and exemplars</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">that constitute a paradigm and then from</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">you know the groups of people have</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">of objects and relations in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s something analogous</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not a consciousness but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">something analogous to consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">moving between the social imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">and the socially shared awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">that is doing something very much like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">you said</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">jordan it&#39;s doing relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s managing relevance realization at</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">at the level of distributed cognition so</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">while i don&#39;t think that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">i think there is something analogous to</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">and that part of what we could be seeing</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">exists for us as a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">right and so that we can we</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;s quite likely we are have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">to radically transform that outer i</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to call it i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">to call it consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">but that outer analog of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">and the inner experience of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">consciousness in a very profound way</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">and i sometimes think jordan and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">you you find this complimentary</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">and not insulting i sometimes think</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">that i sometimes use that a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">trying to understand what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">about when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">yeah that feels right the word that word</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">just kept coming up for me and you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">greg&#39;s used</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">the that particular word a few times the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">in the past a little in the past few</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">moments and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a a strong coordination there</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s almost like you know i&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">the word coherence</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">at the level of distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">yeah and then with a he&#39;s using the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">level the word coherence in the at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">mind uh i believe mine too</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">right and so the challenge is to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.200" style="s2">okay how do you actually enable</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">coherence at the level of i think mine</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">three i may not be using that term just</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">no that&#39;s right yeah right yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">here&#39;s so mind three then</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">is what it is that starts to connect us</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">on a highway of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.520" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">okay and then that&#39;s all that then rises</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">us from primates into people</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">okay that highway of information that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">capacity to justify</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">that creates indigenous knowledge okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:06.240" style="s2">and then ultimately we start building</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">civilizations then we get much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.240" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">material control and voila</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">but we get then the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">cultural knowledge which are these</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">systems of justification that build upon</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">all right and so when we do we get</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">plugged into cartesian dualism in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">particular kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">right that the greeks didn&#39;t so our</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.240" style="s2">relationship to ourselves our relation</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">i think that shakespeare opened up a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.240" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">soliloquy to ourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">right right in a totally different way</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re getting this all this mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">mind three is kind of a blank slate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.520" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">waiting to absorb</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">it&#39;s an organ of culture it&#39;s waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">absorb the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">and then bring you online and then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">feed those you feedback on it</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:43.200" style="s2">okay yeah you know and so and what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">were talking when you guys</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.200" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">were talking remember the singularity</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">conversation you you riffed off the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">singularity paper i gave right</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">and you instantaneously recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">we were changing paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">right accelerating paradigms in space</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">systems so what we&#39;re actually seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:03.120" style="s2">this paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">you know flux crazy flux</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.120" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">all right those paradigms are these the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">the center of these paradigms are</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:13.039" style="s2">okay look at what peter lindberg did</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:15.480" style="s2">with culture 2.0 he gets that table</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.039" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">he gets the archetypal justification the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.480" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">anti-justification the leaders that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">create the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">this is what i stand for this is my</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">investment pattern these are my people</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">this is what i&#39;m against</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">and what&#39;s happened is is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">technology intersection and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">information is completely outstripping</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">any paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">that has for sense making capacity which</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">is driving the system insane</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">and what we&#39;re actually trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">is there a meta position of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">crazy paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">that we could do without babble and not</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">in some top-down authoritarian way but</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">actually sense make</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">so then we could actually have</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">sovereignty so we can network ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">together and right this shit before it</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">fucking collapses</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">yes that&#39;s what i&#39;m hearing yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.840" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">map to me hold this because i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">following you completely but i want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">make sure that it&#39;s actually being held</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">um and i&#39;m not sure if this metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">going to work but just to kind of do the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">two to three just keep moving back and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">forth yep</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">you know if i talk about coherence at</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">the level of mind i guess mind one and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">two there&#39;s something that happens there</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">it seems like an epileptic seizure is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">really nice clean example of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">happens when that coherence breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a series of feedback loops the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">signaling structures and mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">an inhibition and excitation that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">when the neurocognitive architecture is</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">coherent it</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">works right it produces a a set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">emergent properties that are available</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">in this new space called mind2</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">that can generate behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">counterfactuals and all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">and right now what we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">witnessing in mind three</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">is the equivalent the moral equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">of an epileptic seizure</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">because we don&#39;t yet have the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">significant structures and inhibition</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">and excitatory feedback loops to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">maintain</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">coherence if we can&#39;t attain coherence</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:56.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">something locks at that point and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.720" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">doing something new</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">on that substrate 100 percent can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">decide better absolutely yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">that lines up</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">with what what i what i&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">to articulate too</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:12.720" style="s2">or at least the project i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">with that i&#39;ve seen it is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.720" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">in resonance with coca-cola right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">john aren&#39;t we trying to distribute deal</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">logos to bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">in interpersonal participatory harmony</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">and then pull the logic so that our</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">propositional systems align</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">and then if we can extract a particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">kind of justifiable knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">right and then hone in around that to</p>

<p begin="00:31:12.000" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">and exactly and that&#39;s so consistent why</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:16.399" style="s2">the hell did i turn this goddamn thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">into a garden</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.399" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">right and a car cartoon my dad said</p>

<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">but it&#39;s like this art i was i was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">humanistic calling and i was doing all</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">science like of course i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">practitioner as well but i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">bridge and all of a sudden it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">the next transformation is gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">that synthesis of science and humanities</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">is going to have to embrace</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">we can&#39;t have a master in his emissary</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">uh you know break as we did in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">century we got to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">knowing we got to bring back the entire</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">thing has got to come around it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:50.159" style="s2">transitioning into communities and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">creating that synthesis and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.159" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">so is it is it i mean i&#39;ve got three</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">things that are sort of coming up</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">as being the well necessary and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">know if they&#39;re sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">so so one has to do with i guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">the two phases of bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">one is the interfacing there&#39;s the outer</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">facing so</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">don&#39;t bullshit yourself and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">bullshit me</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">um and then and then the third has to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">with this the the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">and just be very careful to not um</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">hmm it&#39;s funny if there&#39;s a recursion</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">here and self-referentiality</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">be very careful to not equivocate</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">be very careful to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">clarity in the communications</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">methodology yes and be very aware</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">of when and where i have to speak a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">little faster unfortunately because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">coming too quickly</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">when a niche for bullshit has opened up</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">in the ambiguity of the communications</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">methodology</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">yes brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">and and why that&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">dangerous and requires us to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">and full of care let&#39;s use both senses</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">of that word</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">careful and full of care um is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.039" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">that what we&#39;re talking about here is</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">not as a static grasping of what is but</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">an aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">right to transformation and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">with transformation</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">is it moves you into non-logical</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">identity it takes you out of script</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">and i&#39;ve made this argument before you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">can&#39;t infer your way through</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">radical transformation it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">that&#39;s why we have narrative narrative</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">trains us in non-logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">right it takes it so you can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">picture of yourself as a four-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">and go there i am</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">which is like what right and you just do</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">it without thinking because narrative</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">has trained you</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">a non-logical idea of identity and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">symbol trains you in non-logic and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:54.399" style="s2">have to teach kids all of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">and we teach them in dialogue how to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.399" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">this we&#39;re training them in non-logical</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">identity because</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">that is what affords them it opens up</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">the counter factual space</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">and makes it transformatively available</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">to them they can</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">ident they can go through aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">but the problem is non-logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">superficially looks like contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">looks like ambiguity looks like</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s and so that is particularly right</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">for bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">yeah right there</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m engaging in for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">this whole project of the year logos and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">all of these wonderful conversations</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">because i think this is about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">simultaneously create the new cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">but also afford the transformations</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">a perspective and participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:49.760" style="s2">that hone my skills and virtues</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">so i can distinguish and discern between</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.760" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">the bullshit and the the non-logical</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:56.079" style="s2">identity of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">i think it&#39;s so good yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.079" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">remember we&#39;ve used that language i</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked about in terms of like does</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">it does the thing rotate this where does</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:03.359" style="s2">it rotate</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">that way and you talk about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.359" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">reciprocal closing and reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:07.599" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">exactly yeah like if you&#39;ve got your</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.599" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">stack upside down</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2">so that relevance realization is no</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">longer grounding you to the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.800" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">you&#39;re in deep trouble in exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">location</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">yeah and what i was just doing by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">way is i was just like as much</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">as possible like seating myself in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">stack being in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">and noticing like how the the felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">of of relevance realization was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">guiding my and orienting and making you</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">spectalization of what was happening so</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">i was able to orient on exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">right thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">and everything was saying yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">yes yes yes we&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">i didn&#39;t have to worry about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">propositional stuff hanging together</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">because i was</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">all right and then you sit on top of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">that your mind two experiential self</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">that then embeds itself in its mind one</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:27.599" style="s2">okay the mind one into mine too is you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">know i use the short end well i&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">stuff in relevance realization bring it</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">into perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">and you know and we&#39;ll be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">that then you have the narrator that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">that&#39;s then that narrator is going to</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">freudian filter</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">all right because that self needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">like hey i&#39;m a good person</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">you know and needs to believe that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">and we know cognitive dissonance is all</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">maintaining a justified state of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">and you can analyze this empirically</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s unbelievably robust</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the private to public</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">filter you know what i call the rogerian</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">filter because i&#39;m a clinician it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">line and bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">or what you&#39;re trying to do to just</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">maintain the public image and not</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">avoid the judgment of other okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:21.839" style="s2">you bullshit say oh yeah i love that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">sweater or oh god i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">influence</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">so it is learning that calibration at</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:31.920" style="s2">the social and personal level</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">how do you calibrate bullshit self</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.920" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">bullshit other and then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">whole analytic problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">and and we we&#39;ve inherited grammars that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">are not fucking up to the task and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:41.760" style="s2">now we get this whole issue of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">well good luck actually trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.760" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">sense when your forefathers fucking</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not handed the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">that&#39;s needed in the situation you find</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">yourself in or at least we have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">rediscover and re-put together uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">philosophically and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">we get that right we get the analytic we</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">get the social we get the personal</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">uh and we&#39;re at least aware of that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">we come into harmony with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">and the right deal logos fucking</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s really cool um i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">know if you if this is something you do</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">but if you if you run a simulation</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">um on every do you guys remove the term</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">with the ess right the evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">stable strategy</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">um that which is not an ess is uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">self-terminating i mean if you run it</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">out long enough it goes to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">evaporates so i just ran a little micro</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">simulation on that so</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">i would like to propose that every</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">single strategy that is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">on the line that you&#39;re describing which</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">is to say every single strategy</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">that is on the line of self-bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">every single strategy that&#39;s on the line</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">of other bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">uh is a is self-terminating</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">this is uh whitehead&#39;s claim our one</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">hope is that evil is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">yeah i i&#39;m going to propose that i can i</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:38:59.680" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">prove it although i don&#39;t know that i</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.680" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">can prove it in propositional language</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">just yet</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">right i i think wisely we know that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">that&#39;s true over time</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">i will say you know villains you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">you know in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">they get away with shit well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">problem right we have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">humans have a time horizon you know if</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">if your civilization</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">every single civilization collapses but</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">they all collapse in a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">15 generations that are like yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">cool what are you talking about and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">those those last few generations are</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">like confused</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">what&#39;s going on why is why is everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">getting worse i don&#39;t get it right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">then and then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">horrible crisis and everybody just sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">of loses their minds right</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">history becomes utterly lost grammar</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">you know put into a into a blender and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">then you kind of reboot on this new</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">basis and you start again like oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">okay we&#39;re cool so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">it has to do i think a little bit with</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">time horizons that are right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">it dumps entropic externalities</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:57.520" style="s2">into the shit of the system and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">going to back it up eventually</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.520" end="00:40:00.560" style="s2">right exactly and that&#39;s going to back</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">it up eventually and so you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.560" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">there will be a reckoning</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">um but there are ways to sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">might die in advance of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly it&#39;s like the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">of the guy who plants the tree he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">i was participating big history</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.880" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">conference and it was be a good ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.520" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what it that&#39;s what it that was</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">yeah so when kant kant talks about</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">well-being essentially he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">wonderful summary of it is happiness</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">with the worthiness to be happy okay so</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">so when you&#39;re bullshitting you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">cutting away at that worthiness</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">right so it&#39;s that dialect it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">yes we want happiness</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">there it&#39;s worthiness to be and it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">that diet that&#39;s a dialectic of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">it&#39;s in an integrated piece and holding</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">i think that&#39;s bringing up haunt and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">happiness is a great</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">segue then for me because</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">i think this is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">bullshitty words we have in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">right now which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">oh god i know that&#39;s i usually hate it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">but when i stumble across the kantian</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">edition i was like all right i can now</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">bring this term back</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">and the greeks have multiple terms for</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">it uh as they always do where we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">i often feel like we&#39;re four year olds</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:25.839" style="s2">with our clunky terms and the greeks</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">have these</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.839" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">same thing with love i mean holy shit</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">love and wisdom we have one word they</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">have sophia they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">right so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">so sort of the modern stuff on or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.760" style="s2">the recent</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">stuff on this seems to be going this way</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.760" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">like i said there&#39;s a lot of conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">but there&#39;s a parsing that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">emerging</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">and to take happiness and to pull it</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">from three things that we put together</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">subjective well-being and meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">life and they can all and they are not</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">identical because they can vary</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">independently from each other</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">you do need a certain amount of success</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">in order to have subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">subjective well-being is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">the autonomy and competence and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">connectedness of the self it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">solidifies the self</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">right that that that that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">subjective well-being is</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:20.319" style="s2">and and if you don&#39;t if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">poverty or if you&#39;re oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.319" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">right if you don&#39;t have enough success</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">in your life then</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.359" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">you don&#39;t have good subjective</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">well-being the thing is though and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">is what the research shows</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">once you get out of poverty right then</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">huge changes in wealth and power only</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">bring small changes in subjective</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:38.960" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">so after a certain stage success and</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">peel apart from each other well he said</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">oh then what</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">is it what ultimately matters is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">subjective well-being no</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">because subjective well-being is not the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">same thing as meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">meaning in life is about ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">mattering to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">an intelligible order that is greater</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">than yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why you can right and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:04.640" style="s2">what goes down when you have a kid</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">why do people do it because meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.480" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">life goes up right</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">and so what we have to understand is</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">when we&#39;re proposing what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">proposing well i&#39;m proposing to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">jordan that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">when we say to people look you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">commit well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">mattering to an intelligible order then</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">greater than you that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">and and and joy is not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">subjective well-being is is the positive</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">sense that yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">has been solidified and strengthened joy</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">the sense of losing yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">something beyond yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">like in awe and wonder and what we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:47.119" style="s2">to unders what we have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.319" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">get people to see is but you should and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:49.839" style="s2">this is what you know the stuff i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">doing with the epicureans in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.839" end="00:44:53.119" style="s2">in that in the morning sanger classes</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">you have to prioritize these in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.119" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">right way</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t identify them and you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">to prioritize them in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like maslow&#39;s hierarchy in some</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">ways you got to get enough success</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">so that you&#39;ve got enough subjective</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">well-being but you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:08.720" style="s2">ultimately really want</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">you ultimately want meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.720" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">because those other all those first two</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">reliably go down with old age and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">many people</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">think that&#39;s why they&#39;re terrified of</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">old age because they can reliably and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">accurately predict</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">success and subjective well-being are</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">going to go down but you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">measure</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">old people older people they actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:30.640" style="s2">much happier than us how can that be</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">because their meaning in life is going</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.640" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">up tremendously because they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">in general we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">probabilistically not individually</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">they have more wisdom and they have more</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">sense of mattering to things beyond</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">and so we have to pull up happy this</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">this notion we have of happiness</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">have right now and we have to pull them</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">right we the babble around that the</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">and what john&#39;s talking about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">how do we non-equivocate on what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">fuck do we mean by well-being</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">and a lot of what john said is it would</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">be embedded in that uh analysis but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">yeah and make sure that what we seek is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.480" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">well-being is the argument and then a</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">rich analysis of what the components of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">well-being</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">but i think it might be useful um</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">so i was thinking about the fact of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">good news and then as we were talking i</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">was then thinking oh</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s also bad news so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">good news is that like wow we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually got some pretty seriously</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">high quality stuff like there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">um a lot of hard questions</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:43.280" style="s2">if you&#39;re able to not bullshit yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">not bullshit others and then move</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.280" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">skillfully</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">through clarity um we can we can make</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">some good ground</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">the bad news is it&#39;s really really</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.760" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve wept a couple of times at night</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">with that basic realization so i agree</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.599" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">yeah yeah and this is where i</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">often part company from my religious</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">okay and and certain of my ideological</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">friends because i do not believe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">a t</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">have that kind of faith</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:28.800" style="s2">and and um and that&#39;s why i&#39;m also very</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">suspicious of utopian visions etc</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.800" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">so that&#39;s where i would say to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">jordan</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">that yeah doing it while you&#39;re having</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">uh when when when like like myself i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">just speaking for myself but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:43.280" style="s2">also for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">but when you don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.280" end="00:47:48.559" style="s2">any inevitable t</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">loss um then it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s why discussion we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">having about a reinvention of faith</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">and reason and continuity of contact and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">wisdom is so important because</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">i i guess for me what else is there</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">what else is there that we can do um i i</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">agree with you jordan it&#39;s a race</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">and there&#39;s i i i i actually think the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:15.839" style="s2">probabilities</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">are against us but i think the moral</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.839" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">is we&#39;ve got to try our best and even if</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">we fail maybe we can light enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">candles</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">so that there&#39;ll be enough light for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">next group of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.359" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">that&#39;s now that&#39;s what i i i like teru</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">and uh albert kim was the play i want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">know how to be a saint without god</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">uh at least the everyday the common</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.640" end="00:48:38.000" style="s2">conception of god</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">and so for me that&#39;s that&#39;s how i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.000" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">of it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">yes it&#39;s the probabilities are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">gonna lose</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">but the moral argument is well</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">there&#39;s we have to try our best with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">best people that we can and with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">skills we have and even if we fail if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:55.920" style="s2">do a good enough job</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">that maybe we have sufficed enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.920" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">satisfies enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:49:00.839" style="s2">that we&#39;ve lit enough candles so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.359" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">enough light for the next group of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.839" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">well and i would say i would say the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">same thing but from the interior of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:10.960" style="s2">which is um if you&#39;re operating in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:14.559" style="s2">what you discover is that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">other way to operate</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.559" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">so i don&#39;t have to imagine a t-list i</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have to imagine a better future</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">all i have to do is act in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">i know is the right way to act</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">and i will in fact do there&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">isometry i mean perfect</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">they are identical they are the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">thing they&#39;re just looking at them from</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">two different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">i agree with that i think that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.800" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">said that and that to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">i mean mclennan in his book on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">wisdom of a patient talks about</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:41.760" style="s2">you know the three degrees you start</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">with the epicureans that&#39;s like primary</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.760" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">school then you move into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">uh high school that&#39;s the stoics and</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:48.319" style="s2">then you move into university that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">new playlist but what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.319" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a very stoic thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">that uh right um and um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.640" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">so i agree with that we&#39;re fucked guys</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">let&#39;s just go get drunk</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">i mean you know there it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">what you were in this trajectory and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m scared of shit you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">um but what you said jordan and what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">both said i mean what</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">you&#39;re now all of a sudden when you wake</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">up in a particular way and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">aligned in a particular way and it just</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">unfolds in some ways i mean just because</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">like the virtue like aristotle talked</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:24.000" style="s2">about in terms of you cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">particular kind of line of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">and the structure essentially starts to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">unfold itself</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:31.040" style="s2">this is sarcasm this is the verb this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">the virtue that we do not have a word</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.040" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">because of sun is to have this</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">this you know this training of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">stalin&#39;s landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">so that you are you are tempted to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">attempt it to the good</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2">what is it i actually yeah i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:49.280" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s what&#39;s it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">cardinal virtues</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">i should probably know it then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">usually translated as moderation</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t affect it or temperance</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.839" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t capture it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">in fact many people have tried to argue</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">that maybe the closest thing we now have</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">for soccer isn&#39;t it something closer</p>

<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">he&#39;s worried about whether his system of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:25.839" style="s2">justification is being taken right</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">how well am i doing he&#39;s worried about</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.839" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">what&#39;s happening of course he&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">his own way</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">and you can feel it right it feels</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">crunchy it feels like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">there it&#39;s not loose it&#39;s not cool and</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:38.559" style="s2">guy is</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">cool which is critical right he&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">one hand he is not attached right so we</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">can bring in a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">of the of the eastern flair right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">good with what he&#39;s doing that he is no</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">longer trying</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:52.960" style="s2">at all and the effortlessness is part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">the flood right but it&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.960" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not some random jackass who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">know how to play the trumpet</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">right right that&#39;s also not attached</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">right that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about somebody for whom</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">the skillfulness of flowing allows him</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">to actually get out of his own way</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">and let the thing do the thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">supposed to do without the least bit of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:11.839" style="s2">concern for his interior or the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">folks which is way of producing</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.839" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">beautiful music</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">and then of course at every once in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">while he&#39;ll stop he&#39;ll kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">around and he&#39;s like everybody&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">whoa dude that was awesome it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">all right i don&#39;t know what just</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">happened but i&#39;m going to keep working</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">on that vibe because that&#39;s where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.680" end="00:57:26.480" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">exactly so and and essentially then the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.480" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">mind three</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">that self-conscious mind three is sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">of checking out and you&#39;re just in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:34.799" style="s2">perspectival participatory groove</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">at an inner subjective inter usually an</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.799" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">impulsive intersubjective way</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">but i think something else just came out</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">of that right</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">it sounded to me jordan i think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about now that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:47.839" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s two existential modes</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2">within the justification framework</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.839" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">there&#39;s an encratia mode which is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">one that we have taken as being</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">but there&#39;s also socratic yep mode of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">justification yeah yeah no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">not we&#39;re trying to seek that right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">if we open up and we find that and y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">light and the shine light</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">through and there&#39;s a pathway</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.680" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">yeah and the cool thing is you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:09.280" style="s2">actually you know when they&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">you&#39;re there like there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.280" end="00:58:12.000" style="s2">actually being there and feeling there</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">like you know some basketball players</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.000" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">will talk about notion of like when</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">they&#39;re in the zone</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">yeah they can be aware of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">zone they</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:21.280" style="s2">yeah you gotta be real careful yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">gotta be</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.280" end="00:58:24.640" style="s2">too real careful that energy and all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">a sudden you&#39;re jacking stuff out right</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.640" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">you just basically want that observer</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">function that narrative all right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">just well this guy&#39;s fucking on fire</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:33.040" style="s2">yeah exactly you&#39;re just like checking</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">out going wow i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.040" end="00:58:37.680" style="s2">watching this thing but that imagine</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">that now being truly in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.680" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:42.319" style="s2">oh my god distributed right and can you</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">imagine the transformation between the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.319" end="00:58:46.319" style="s2">chaos the epileptic chaos and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">collective insanity of psychosis that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">were seeing versus the</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">yeah yeah i can i can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">well fingers crossed right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">interesting how it circles back in a way</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:58:59.920" style="s2">because i mean in one sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:01.440" style="s2">talking upwards about sort of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.920" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">and distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">but when we get when you get that when</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">you get collective flow</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">right you also get an altered state of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">right and so it also that&#39;s what i meant</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:14.799" style="s2">about it reverberates back</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">into right and many people go i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.799" end="00:59:17.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:18.799" style="s2">and they have this weird anamnesis</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.799" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">this you know i&#39;ve never been here they</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">say this paradoxical thing i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">been here before</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">but this is truly who i am which is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:28.319" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">right but that to me that&#39;s the hallmark</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.319" end="00:59:31.520" style="s2">of somebody trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:33.200" style="s2">articulate that they&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.520" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">aspirational burst</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">right in some huge way right they felt</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:39.599" style="s2">the alignment</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:41.280" style="s2">and then of course the crucial thing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.599" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">to say yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.280" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">don&#39;t throw words at it man right but</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s just going to make a mess</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:52.559" style="s2">of things like let&#39;s just let it be</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:52.559" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">well gentlemen i think this is where we</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="01:00:01.280" style="s2">should let it be this is a perfect let</p>
