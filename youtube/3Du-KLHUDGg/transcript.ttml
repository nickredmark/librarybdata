<p begin="00:00:12.200" end="00:00:19.230" style="s2">Benjamin you&#39;re the author of war for</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.870" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">eternity inside bannon&#39;s far-right</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:26.250" style="s2">the title of your book and it&#39;s about</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">it should sort of adventures and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.890" end="00:00:37.940" style="s2">speaking with Bannen and various other</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">people like Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.940" end="00:00:45.059" style="s2">sugan and Dugan and various people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">have been inspired by something called</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.059" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">traditionalism which probably know most</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:50.550" style="s2">people don&#39;t know anything about and yet</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">it seems to be having this huge</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">influence in the geopolitical world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">that seems to be the thesis of your book</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">and also you&#39;re a music teacher and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:05.270" style="s2">your book you said that that you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">you&#39;ve been accused of being a spy so so</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.270" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">so I so I&#39;m just wondering like I must</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:13.409" style="s2">take a lot of courage to talk to these</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">guys and you must deal with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.409" end="00:01:20.729" style="s2">blowback yeah what what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">driving you to what is driving you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.729" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">towards you know you wanting to know</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">about you know what&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">Benin and all of these of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">characters well I mean it it&#39;s the sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">of thing that you know the more it</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">starts you know years years in the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:41.780" style="s2">I mean it was 2010 when I started doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">this type of work really in Sweden and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.780" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">when you gain insight and when you gain</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">special insight to a topic you know or a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:53.369" style="s2">group of people it does kind of fuel</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">itself you want to learn more you become</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.369" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">you become expert in some something and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">you want to you know deepen that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">expertise so it it was it was really</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:05.479" style="s2">quite random there wasn&#39;t a big agenda</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:08.520" style="s2">behind my wanting to do this early on</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.479" end="00:02:11.569" style="s2">but but certainly as time went on I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.520" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">the nationalism right-wing populism</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.569" end="00:02:16.740" style="s2">whatever you want to call it under you</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">there&#39;s so many bad names for for these</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.740" end="00:02:22.890" style="s2">causes but they&#39;ve become one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">most transformative political wings in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.890" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">in the early 21st century so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">certainly it&#39;s exciting also to feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">like you&#39;re you&#39;re witnessing history or</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.630" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">that you have a front-row seat to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">some of the major changes in politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:40.350" style="s2">today so that that keeps me interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">but but I also like you know someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.350" end="00:02:46.320" style="s2">more intangibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">and drew I also like the micro view of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.320" end="00:02:50.070" style="s2">things I think a lot of scholars</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">especially political scientists if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.070" end="00:02:54.920" style="s2">to throw some punches in the university</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">world but a lot of people like to go big</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.920" end="00:03:00.240" style="s2">and and generalize and I&#39;m my instincts</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">are slightly different like</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.240" end="00:03:05.190" style="s2">personalities I like the chaos that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:08.190" style="s2">see when you really zoom in on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.190" end="00:03:09.990" style="s2">painting and the way that that can also</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.190" end="00:03:12.600" style="s2">take place when you zoom in on an</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.990" end="00:03:14.820" style="s2">individual so the the type of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.600" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">methodology that I used ethnography</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.820" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">which is really about getting to know</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.920" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">somebody as best as best you can and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">colloquial sense of that of that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">getting to know someone I&#39;m I&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">by that it&#39;s almost like anthropology in</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:32.700" style="s2">a way uh yeah much as positive you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">what&#39;s so surprising about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:36.270" style="s2">I I would have I would have made the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">opposite comment about Ben&#39;s quirk</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.270" end="00:03:40.110" style="s2">mm-hmm compare the other guys south to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:42.030" style="s2">doing political anthropology because</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.110" end="00:03:43.770" style="s2">what I love about Ben&#39;s work is abstract</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.030" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s the fact for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.770" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2">warfare turned into the brilliant book</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:50.670" style="s2">because there was global scope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.850" end="00:03:52.260" style="s2">big right that&#39;s big but that could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.670" end="00:03:54.209" style="s2">possibly causes a reader</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.260" end="00:03:57.209" style="s2">I&#39;m obviously philosophers I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.209" end="00:03:59.160" style="s2">interested in the ideology and in less</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.209" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">in the journalism or already individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.160" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">behind it because I&#39;m interested in why</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">dog and and Bano think a lot but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">think that has anything to do with their</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:08.580" style="s2">personality types I think it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">with there&#39;s a certain collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.580" end="00:04:13.110" style="s2">unconscious thing going on at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:16.019" style="s2">and and this is what&#39;s coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.110" end="00:04:18.570" style="s2">forefront and by reading Ben I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.019" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">think anybody better catches why these</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.570" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">guys arrive at the conclusions they do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">and the contradictions of course they</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">arrive it there&#39;s a lot of romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:27.750" style="s2">and contradiction involved they all</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.430" style="s2">drive which it actually thrives on</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.750" end="00:04:31.290" style="s2">so that&#39;s why I read been talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.430" end="00:04:34.530" style="s2">so yeah maybe I could say something too</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.290" end="00:04:36.540" style="s2">about why I I was compelled by your book</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.530" end="00:04:40.290" style="s2">and I I thought it was beautiful as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.540" end="00:04:42.510" style="s2">it was that I met a guy in 2015 right</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.290" end="00:04:44.910" style="s2">before a trunk was elected who was on</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.510" end="00:04:49.620" style="s2">the extreme far left and he was a you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.910" end="00:04:52.470" style="s2">know apologist of Lenin and Stalin and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.620" end="00:04:54.180" style="s2">he loved authoritarianism on some level</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.470" end="00:04:56.100" style="s2">but I thought he was just you know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.180" end="00:04:57.540" style="s2">could understand he was a leftist you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.100" end="00:04:59.940" style="s2">know he was you know I could understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.540" end="00:05:01.800" style="s2">it was a sort of ideology that I could</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.940" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">understand then when Trump was elected</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.800" end="00:05:05.550" style="s2">suddenly he became he moved to the far</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:07.830" style="s2">right and he became a Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.550" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">traditionalist and he followed Bannen he</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.830" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">loves Benin he loves he loves Marco so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:14.490" style="s2">was I was just and I knew this guy in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:16.520" style="s2">very intimate level like I worked with</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.490" end="00:05:19.169" style="s2">him and I talked to him every day and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.520" end="00:05:22.200" style="s2">you know as he discussed his his</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.169" end="00:05:24.840" style="s2">theories he wasn&#39;t stupid by any means</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.200" end="00:05:28.919" style="s2">even though I found his views you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.840" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">on gay people and somewhat repulsive and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.919" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">and I I could tell that he had some</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:35.940" style="s2">daddy issues and all this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">at the same time psycho phallus to me he</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.940" end="00:05:40.950" style="s2">was not he was not stupid and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:43.979" style="s2">obsession with phallus as Julia Kristeva</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.950" end="00:05:47.040" style="s2">would say so this guy was kind of known</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.979" end="00:05:49.530" style="s2">in some small circles as a quasi</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.040" end="00:05:52.530" style="s2">journalist who who you know he went and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.530" end="00:05:54.510" style="s2">visited Dugan and Iran and various</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.530" end="00:05:56.250" style="s2">places he was in he went to all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.510" end="00:06:00.450" style="s2">places like you know that nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.250" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">would go to Syria and and and he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.450" end="00:06:07.380" style="s2">beloved of this small community and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">so it reminded me a bit about you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.380" end="00:06:11.220" style="s2">was very fascinated by this character</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.450" style="s2">for it for a long time and remind me a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.220" end="00:06:15.390" style="s2">little bit about your relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.450" end="00:06:17.760" style="s2">with Ben and Dugan and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.390" end="00:06:21.479" style="s2">thing so that&#39;s the personal aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.760" end="00:06:22.890" style="s2">it yeah oh yeah a lot of guys like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.479" end="00:06:25.050" style="s2">so there you go there&#39;s a lot of guys</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.890" end="00:06:28.710" style="s2">like that but but but they come as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.050" end="00:06:30.380" style="s2">kind of a sneaky it came as a man did</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.710" end="00:06:32.729" style="s2">you find guys like this in your work</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:08.860" style="s2">that has wider application that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:10.839" style="s2">really excites me I think there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.610" end="00:08:29.589" style="s2">speak to more generalizable concepts but</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.860" end="00:08:31.810" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s great to I think also to to</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.590" end="00:10:10.890" style="s2">is it is the task of those who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.330" end="00:10:13.710" style="s2">enlightened to this to try and discover</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.890" end="00:10:16.500" style="s2">what that eternal truth was and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.710" end="00:10:18.570" style="s2">outlines a number of ways to do it his</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.500" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">his prevailing approach was to commit</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.570" end="00:10:25.020" style="s2">yourself to one of these imperfect past</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:26.370" style="s2">that exists today vote yourself to it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.020" end="00:10:28.530" style="s2">work as hard as you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.370" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">and maybe you&#39;ll catch a glimpse of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.530" end="00:10:32.610" style="s2">was if you stay in that and stay in your</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.380" style="s2">lane essentially and so he became</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.610" end="00:10:38.070" style="s2">eventually he wanted to become a Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.380" end="00:10:40.620" style="s2">but he becomes a Sufi moves to Egypt and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.070" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">and dies answering not to renege and on</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.620" end="00:10:45.570" style="s2">but to the name of Shaykh Abdallah Wahid</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">Yahia you know changes his life commits</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.570" end="00:10:49.500" style="s2">himself to Sufism he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:56.310" style="s2">converted to Sufism by Swedish painter</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.500" end="00:10:58.440" style="s2">so this is like one of my idols so yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.310" end="00:11:00.210" style="s2">and as a story that I think it&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.400" end="00:11:15.779" style="s2">would you say is that his name is even I</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.710" end="00:11:18.779" style="s2">greatly so we don&#39;t miss the name yes so</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.520" end="00:11:47.520" style="s2">out of politics in part because he sees</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">actually the Dark Age it&#39;s what Hindus</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.920" end="00:12:02.060" style="s2">would call the Kali Yuga and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:12:05.100" style="s2">age of decay of fatalistic decline where</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.060" end="00:12:08.670" style="s2">differentiation is lost whether it&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.880" end="00:12:39.390" style="s2">19th century which is still this</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.390" end="00:12:44.339" style="s2">kind of a goal so it obviously sounds</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.209" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">like pagan or even Hindu in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.339" end="00:12:48.540" style="s2">that was being brought back is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.550" style="s2">that the circularity of time is dominant</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.540" end="00:12:53.730" style="s2">and in the idea that time is linear and</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.730" end="00:12:57.209" style="s2">an illusion right so this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.529" end="00:13:00.540" style="s2">really strong traditionalist we do agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.209" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">and absolutely in a certain sense this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.540" end="00:13:04.980" style="s2">is I think this is the linchpin to the</p>

<p begin="00:20:42.050" end="00:20:46.430" style="s2">evolution but the problem with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.940" end="00:20:50.590" style="s2">evolution is you can&#39;t discuss it until</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.430" end="00:20:53.240" style="s2">you first discuss is it humans there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.590" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">progressing or is it our environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.240" end="00:20:56.750" style="s2">that is progressing this is like</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.150" end="00:21:03.020" style="s2">have all that&#39;s of course what Plato&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.020" end="00:21:06.440" style="s2">traditions are that we should have all</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.310" end="00:21:21.890" style="s2">time not you and this is where this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.270" end="00:21:24.050" style="s2">where it gets interesting because in a</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.980" end="00:21:29.960" style="s2">makes perfect sense we have undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:31.400" style="s2">technologically evolved with last 8,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.960" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">years and we would probably need</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.400" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">technology to solve the current problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:37.310" style="s2">where it&#39;s like i can go for technical</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:39.790" style="s2">and intolerant easily but i have to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.310" end="00:21:42.740" style="s2">it in my work by attacking Plato</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.790" end="00:21:44.150" style="s2">fiercely attacking this idea that human</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.740" end="00:21:45.380" style="s2">beings evolved at all because I just I</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.150" end="00:21:47.210" style="s2">just think human bees are getting more</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.380" end="00:21:48.770" style="s2">and more stupid I think our brains have</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.210" end="00:21:50.210" style="s2">shrunk over the last eight thousand</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.770" end="00:21:52.250" style="s2">years we&#39;re just getting more muscular</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.210" end="00:21:53.780" style="s2">more dependent on the machine so while</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.250" end="00:21:55.370" style="s2">the machine is growing we human beings</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.780" end="00:21:56.930" style="s2">are becoming more and more deteriorated</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.370" end="00:21:58.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s where I think I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.930" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">the old right guys they&#39;re onto</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.490" end="00:22:01.730" style="s2">something that there is still</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:04.250" style="s2">development to the human mind to speak</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.730" end="00:22:06.920" style="s2">of but I would argue with them that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.250" end="00:22:08.540" style="s2">their obsession with the circular time a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.920" end="00:22:11.030" style="s2">certain mother worship but God is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.540" end="00:22:12.190" style="s2">worship I contrast with the god worship</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.030" end="00:22:14.830" style="s2">all the gods</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:17.740" style="s2">it and then you arrived in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.830" end="00:22:20.110" style="s2">different place much more Hegelian hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.740" end="00:22:23.320" style="s2">but that&#39;s why I love Ben&#39;s work and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.110" end="00:22:25.809" style="s2">think the book is profound with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.320" end="00:22:28.419" style="s2">dialogue with all try right hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.809" end="00:22:31.480" style="s2">where but what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.419" end="00:22:34.059" style="s2">those is the God worship of Technology</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.480" end="00:22:37.720" style="s2">there there we see a teleology and there</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.059" end="00:22:38.740" style="s2">we see progress yes okay for the simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.720" end="00:22:41.409" style="s2">reason that it&#39;s information</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.740" end="00:22:43.570" style="s2">accumulation so once I&#39;ve invented a</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.409" end="00:22:47.289" style="s2">certain machine and the recipe for that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.570" end="00:22:49.269" style="s2">machine exists I don&#39;t have to invent</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.289" end="00:22:50.919" style="s2">the recipe again I just make a copy of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.269" end="00:22:55.539" style="s2">that machine so the cost of a new</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.919" end="00:22:58.269" style="s2">machine follow flow in a the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.539" end="00:23:00.129" style="s2">each machine is cheaper and cheaper so</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.269" end="00:23:01.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s why we can develop normal</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.129" end="00:23:03.659" style="s2">technology so that&#39;s what you say for</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.720" end="00:23:05.860" style="s2">example in my work that would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.659" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">handwriting changed the world forever</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.860" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">biggest revolution ever what 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:11.649" style="s2">years ago the printing press was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:13.899" style="s2">similar revolution almost on the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.649" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">scale six others ago the internet</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.899" end="00:23:19.000" style="s2">certain revolution the same scale now so</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:20.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve increased communication increased</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.000" end="00:23:22.509" style="s2">capacities for information storage and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.740" end="00:23:24.850" style="s2">of course even more complexity with each</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.509" end="00:23:28.539" style="s2">level a more and more complex which</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.850" end="00:23:31.299" style="s2">again today with enormous complexity the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.539" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">Internet&#39;s forcing onto us means these</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.299" end="00:23:36.399" style="s2">alt-right guys are very attractive in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">romantic way because they say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.399" end="00:23:42.250" style="s2">worry because it&#39;s all just a repetition</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:45.070" style="s2">of the same yes yeah they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.250" end="00:23:46.750" style="s2">they&#39;re heading backwards I mean on some</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.070" end="00:23:50.590" style="s2">level it&#39;s just some golden age in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.750" end="00:23:53.830" style="s2">past which which and I think your vision</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.590" end="00:23:55.690" style="s2">of Cynthia ism is is is is more of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.830" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">constructive utopian version for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.690" end="00:24:00.669" style="s2">future so so let&#39;s do it no no no no no</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:04.269" style="s2">the only difference here is that I agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.669" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">I agree is a niche and Alesi and thinker</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.269" end="00:24:07.570" style="s2">today and all the delusions are involved</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:08.980" style="s2">in this discussion I mean Nick lond for</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.570" end="00:24:11.110" style="s2">example no the friend of mine he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:12.759" style="s2">fantastic thinker the author of dark</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.110" end="00:24:14.200" style="s2">enlightenment any sort of acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.759" end="00:24:15.850" style="s2">is just awful connected oh I&#39;ll try I</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.200" end="00:24:17.289" style="s2">don&#39;t think I am and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.850" end="00:24:19.419" style="s2">either but we&#39;re in dialogue whether we</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.289" end="00:24:21.250" style="s2">find incredibly fascinating because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.419" end="00:24:23.320" style="s2">are doing them and say that to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.250" end="00:24:25.460" style="s2">not so much that the Nomad ology the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.320" end="00:24:27.370" style="s2">sort of Western Hinduism that these guys</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.460" end="00:24:29.870" style="s2">percent it&#39;s all so much that it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.370" end="00:24:31.539" style="s2">just like Christianity isn&#39;t wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.870" end="00:24:33.980" style="s2">it&#39;s just half the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.539" end="00:24:35.000" style="s2">because you have to supplement the norm</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.980" end="00:24:36.679" style="s2">at all and you with it of ontology</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.000" end="00:24:38.330" style="s2">because otherwise it wouldn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.679" end="00:24:39.830" style="s2">sense would we just be back in the Stone</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.330" end="00:24:41.630" style="s2">Age back in the Stone Age back in stone</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.950" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">event but like Aristotle said the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.140" end="00:24:51.679" style="s2">evidence of the event is in the context</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:53.330" style="s2">in our milieu which has developed for</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.679" end="00:24:54.830" style="s2">good or bad and changed radically</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.330" end="00:24:56.600" style="s2">whereas we as human beings are born</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.830" end="00:24:58.669" style="s2">exactly the same as ten thousand years</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:10.190" style="s2">it would be fascinating to hear hear you</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.580" end="00:25:11.779" style="s2">talk about aunt Jungian of course who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.210" end="00:35:09.319" style="s2">get agreement of course we saw Rastro</p>

<p begin="00:36:03.650" end="00:36:08.180" style="s2">stands for but we agree on here is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.170" end="00:36:10.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a spiritual crisis in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.180" end="00:36:11.840" style="s2">society and the only way out of that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.220" end="00:36:14.420" style="s2">basically to tear down the entire</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.840" end="00:36:16.040" style="s2">political system assist today make all</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.420" end="00:36:17.780" style="s2">the previous political ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.040" end="00:36:19.420" style="s2">redundant and look back at how human</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.420" end="00:36:23.120" style="s2">anthropologically and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.470" end="00:36:25.820" style="s2">discover we only have tribe nation</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.120" end="00:36:28.130" style="s2">Empire to work with on which the third</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.820" end="00:36:29.990" style="s2">Empire is the best model today for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.130" end="00:36:34.340" style="s2">world as all but the most difficult one</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.990" end="00:36:36.470" style="s2">to achieve it&#39;s also I mean not to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.340" end="00:36:38.600" style="s2">engage with that that last point but</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.470" end="00:36:41.390" style="s2">when I mean when you think about Israel</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.600" end="00:36:42.980" style="s2">as a nation or Jews as a nation the sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.390" end="00:36:47.240" style="s2">of nation that would supersede or not</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.980" end="00:36:49.430" style="s2">rely upon the state yeah per se you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.240" end="00:36:50.840" style="s2">that that adds that adds certainly a bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.430" end="00:36:53.690" style="s2">of force to this this particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.840" end="00:36:55.130" style="s2">nationalism so oh yeah absolutely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.690" end="00:36:57.320" style="s2">the point it&#39;s stronger than the state</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.130" end="00:36:59.120" style="s2">and I mean Hegel wrote this I mean we</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.740" end="00:44:08.540" style="s2">really terrified of there not being any</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.810" end="00:44:10.250" style="s2">conspiracy at all you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.540" end="00:44:12.440" style="s2">like you know if God does not exist I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.250" end="00:44:14.930" style="s2">be the ultimate terror so if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.440" end="00:44:17.270" style="s2">order anywhere in the scales then he</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.930" end="00:44:19.220" style="s2">really is cares right so the guys take</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.270" end="00:44:20.870" style="s2">to this idea and then you got the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.220" end="00:44:23.150" style="s2">internet and you get alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.870" end="00:44:25.250" style="s2">and you get a very simple story like</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.150" end="00:44:26.220" style="s2">this you never heard this before because</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.250" end="00:44:28.710" style="s2">commanders</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.220" end="00:44:31.320" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t hear it and basically after</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.710" end="00:44:32.940" style="s2">1945 you get this idea that all of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.320" end="00:44:34.830" style="s2">has been banned and censored and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.940" end="00:44:37.080" style="s2">could read it and it&#39;s only being a cult</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.830" end="00:44:39.540" style="s2">or or you know chaos magic or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.080" end="00:44:40.980" style="s2">and suddenly pops up and these guys like</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.540" end="00:44:43.590" style="s2">Steve banning in America you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.980" end="00:44:45.270" style="s2">working-class guy very clear sharp and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.590" end="00:44:47.970" style="s2">all that in Dogon in Russia these guys</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.270" end="00:44:50.849" style="s2">pop up and with the internet they are</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.970" end="00:44:53.400" style="s2">obviously the first guys that aboard</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.849" end="00:44:55.380" style="s2">computer game guy young guy would look</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.400" end="00:44:57.390" style="s2">at and finally come in live and say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.380" end="00:44:58.920" style="s2">I want to do shit because these guys are</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.390" end="00:45:00.330" style="s2">basically presenting the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.920" end="00:45:01.650" style="s2">conspiracy theory where I think is</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.330" end="00:45:03.930" style="s2">traditionalism is really strong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.650" end="00:45:05.490" style="s2">just like conspiracy theories if there</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.930" end="00:45:07.050" style="s2">are conspiracies out there you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.490" end="00:45:08.580" style="s2">probably be like Ben Teitelbaum if</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.590" end="00:45:18.540" style="s2">part of them by engaging with a guy like</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.750" end="00:45:20.430" style="s2">Baron or Dover there&#39;s some excess you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.540" end="00:45:23.670" style="s2">guys etcetera like so many young men</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.670" end="00:45:29.099" style="s2">has exploded so quickly and why even</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.190" end="00:45:31.170" style="s2">cause brexit you drove brexit to be</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:41.400" style="s2">longer and it&#39;s precisely powerful among</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.910" end="00:45:44.040" style="s2">young men which is always a radical</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.400" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">change it&#39;s also because the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.040" end="00:45:52.740" style="s2">that are being presented to us are such</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:55.800" style="s2">weak figures that that when you hear a</p>

<p begin="00:46:29.310" end="00:46:33.960" style="s2">though there&#39;s a way in which Bannon is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.290" end="00:46:35.580" style="s2">sort of a he&#39;s sort of a moral ISA he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.960" end="00:46:37.910" style="s2">sort of there&#39;s something about him that</p>

<p begin="00:46:42.140" end="00:46:45.080" style="s2">talking about the separation of children</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.820" end="00:46:46.580" style="s2">at the border and all that and he was</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.080" end="00:46:48.950" style="s2">like sort of almost cheering it on or</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.580" end="00:46:51.710" style="s2">something like that you know now this it</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.950" end="00:46:55.460" style="s2">seems like he&#39;s ready for anything to</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.710" end="00:46:57.530" style="s2">happen to get us into this Dark Age of</p>

<p begin="00:47:03.770" end="00:47:09.800" style="s2">very common misconception that this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.530" end="00:47:12.680" style="s2">over typically American overemphasis on</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.700" end="00:47:23.000" style="s2">all the time and I think Bannon is one</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.500" end="00:47:25.100" style="s2">of these guys who goes for the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.000" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">thing he&#39;s definitely goes for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.100" end="00:47:29.510" style="s2">working class he&#39;s you know it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:31.250" style="s2">passionate about it he&#39;s passionate</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.250" end="00:47:35.480" style="s2">that&#39;s real but he puts it like fatherly</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.860" end="00:47:37.910" style="s2">it&#39;s just like yeah I&#39;m passionate about</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.370" end="00:49:23.450" style="s2">wrote about him and my take on him is</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.810" end="00:49:26.390" style="s2">not free of criticism right or a</p>

<p begin="00:59:04.900" end="00:59:08.980" style="s2">what is the constant struggle between</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.520" end="00:59:11.560" style="s2">Islam and Sufism and why Sufism has</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.980" end="00:59:13.900" style="s2">obviously pre-islamic origins its surest</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.560" end="00:59:16.270" style="s2">on ISM Buddhism originally and it has</p>

<p begin="00:59:18.339" end="00:59:22.780" style="s2">eventually became is surmised formally</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.589" end="00:59:25.510" style="s2">but of course the Sufis are populist</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.780" end="00:59:27.400" style="s2">that with the people I would say today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.510" end="00:59:27.910" style="s2">Sufis are more people like Camille</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.339" end="00:59:55.790" style="s2">problem which is fun to do which is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.079" end="00:59:57.320" style="s2">middle class sort of media elite</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.700" end="01:00:05.780" style="s2">going so in that sense sufi yes I love</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.770" end="01:00:07.550" style="s2">Sufism for the simple reason when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.780" end="01:00:09.170" style="s2">work in Kurdistan or some like that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.550" end="01:00:12.290" style="s2">Sufis are the ones you trust was there</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.170" end="01:00:13.640" style="s2">with the people huh very popular yeah is</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.290" end="01:00:14.810" style="s2">that the point you were trying to make I</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.640" end="01:00:16.190" style="s2">thought there&#39;s a bit there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.810" end="01:00:18.200" style="s2">else to your point is there is there</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.190" end="01:00:19.790" style="s2">well it&#39;s because you can look at it</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.200" end="01:00:23.330" style="s2">both ways actually that could be a point</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.790" end="01:00:26.300" style="s2">Andrew is that you know I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.330" end="01:00:28.340" style="s2">also in kind of the obscures Western</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.300" end="01:00:31.600" style="s2">sophist which is which it just which to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.340" end="01:00:34.010" style="s2">say like you know a westerner who is</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.600" end="01:00:35.450" style="s2">committed to alternative spiritualities</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.010" end="01:00:38.810" style="s2">which Sufism is going to be an off the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.450" end="01:00:40.820" style="s2">beaten path sort of thing to do in in</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.810" end="01:00:41.750" style="s2">the West especially let&#39;s say at CPAC</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.820" end="01:00:44.420" style="s2">and they&#39;re you know Republican</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.750" end="01:00:47.660" style="s2">Republican Party to have some affinities</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.420" end="01:00:49.460" style="s2">for Sufism is a very strange thing and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.660" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">you could look at the content of Sufism</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.460" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">which was what Alex was just doing I</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a point to be</p>

<p begin="01:10:37.530" end="01:10:42.960" style="s2">and the religion there was certainly</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.170" end="01:10:44.520" style="s2">because during a period of 60 to 70</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.960" end="01:10:46.230" style="s2">thousand years essentially we were all</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.520" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">the same around the planet wandered</p>

<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:08.330" style="s2">massive scale so we can prove that</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.380" end="01:11:10.340" style="s2">there&#39;s was a sociology in the original</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.330" end="01:11:12.650" style="s2">tried and out of that we&#39;re not trying</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.340" end="01:11:14.599" style="s2">to deduce the narrative this tribe would</p>

<p begin="01:11:14.599" end="01:11:18.530" style="s2">turns out to be nominal adji and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.730" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">exact of a traditionalist and fits in so</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.530" end="01:11:23.150" style="s2">well because that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:25.010" style="s2">traditionalism is except technology</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.150" end="01:11:26.750" style="s2">arrived five thousand years ago and my</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.010" end="01:11:29.119" style="s2">argument is you can&#39;t stop there because</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.750" end="01:11:31.190" style="s2">you only get half the story and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.119" end="01:11:32.690" style="s2">why I think Dugan of these guys maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.190" end="01:11:34.280" style="s2">not better but Dugan these guys are</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.690" end="01:11:37.250" style="s2">gonna fail and fold into some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.280" end="01:11:39.170" style="s2">romantic trap and that will lead to war</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.250" end="01:11:41.810" style="s2">and then chaos because actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.170" end="01:11:44.840" style="s2">a storm do gonna be so I mean doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.810" end="01:11:46.670" style="s2">tie into the global Empire that a talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.840" end="01:11:48.530" style="s2">about what the machine is all over the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.670" end="01:11:50.480" style="s2">place and we have Asus or Chris you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.530" end="01:11:52.130" style="s2">that he doesn&#39;t really discuss that he</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.480" end="01:11:54.260" style="s2">just went to voice out of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.130" end="01:11:57.500" style="s2">completely seems to want to go to war</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.260" end="01:11:59.840" style="s2">with modernity yeah but without weapons</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.500" end="01:12:02.389" style="s2">they&#39;re much more explicit way than</p>

<p begin="01:12:02.389" end="01:12:06.590" style="s2">gonna build the bombs because that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.679" end="01:12:09.290" style="s2">requires high in technology again again</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.590" end="01:12:10.699" style="s2">because Russia&#39;s failed a technology</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.290" end="01:12:12.290" style="s2">because they&#39;re still organized did you</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.699" end="01:12:14.210" style="s2">know with NASA Putin money from the top</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.290" end="01:12:15.830" style="s2">and they did terrible and of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.210" end="01:12:17.330" style="s2">what&#39;s up and telegram were invented in</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.830" end="01:12:19.159" style="s2">Eastern Europe but they both went to</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.330" end="01:12:20.510" style="s2">America right away so Russia&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.159" end="01:12:22.250" style="s2">completely completely failed in</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.510" end="01:12:23.719" style="s2">technology its culture and of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.250" end="01:12:25.639" style="s2">then it&#39;s only natural after 30 years of</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.719" end="01:12:27.860" style="s2">failure there the Russian now turns</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.639" end="01:12:30.650" style="s2">inwards and goes more romantic goes more</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.860" end="01:12:32.810" style="s2">Russian Orthodox and there I think Dugan</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.650" end="01:12:33.860" style="s2">has to come rather the philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.810" end="01:12:35.929" style="s2">something that points forward he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:16:05.710" end="01:16:09.520" style="s2">comparisons and can ask you a question</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.200" end="01:16:12.760" style="s2">about you living in America can a</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.520" end="01:16:16.630" style="s2">sequester vary favor okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.760" end="01:16:18.490" style="s2">even my favorite Americans lie in order</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.630" end="01:16:20.740" style="s2">on purpose right</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.490" end="01:16:23.050" style="s2">Peter Thiel for example I love Peter</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.740" end="01:16:24.760" style="s2">Thiel he you know share a lot of come</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.050" end="01:16:26.440" style="s2">you know personality traits and probably</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.760" end="01:16:27.970" style="s2">collaborators in the future but in Peter</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.440" end="01:16:29.770" style="s2">Thiel says that he believes the cries</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.970" end="01:16:31.510" style="s2">died it was resurrected on the third day</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.770" end="01:16:34.840" style="s2">and he looks like Bill Clinton talked</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.510" end="01:16:36.070" style="s2">about Monica Lewinsky with assassin okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.840" end="01:16:37.900" style="s2">so that&#39;s do you need the whole</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.070" end="01:16:39.370" style="s2">restitution money so badly you have to</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.900" end="01:16:41.440" style="s2">lie in public like that Peter Thiel I</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.370" end="01:16:43.180" style="s2">mean during European person it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.440" end="01:16:46.090" style="s2">why can&#39;t you just tell the truth or</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.180" end="01:16:48.670" style="s2">shut the fuck up it&#39;s just like do you</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.090" end="01:16:50.650" style="s2">think bad on in this American mode</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.670" end="01:16:52.600" style="s2">without realizing it actually sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.650" end="01:16:55.690" style="s2">think that he could serve his overall</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.600" end="01:16:59.890" style="s2">interest to cynically lie to people well</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.690" end="01:17:02.110" style="s2">he&#39;s a Catholic isn&#39;t he tosses what are</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.890" end="01:17:05.590" style="s2">we talking about defenses of Trump no</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.110" end="01:17:08.980" style="s2">more like more like it could you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.590" end="01:17:12.940" style="s2">instead of telling the truth at all</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.980" end="01:17:15.730" style="s2">times I serve a higher purpose where</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.940" end="01:17:19.030" style="s2">people will get what&#39;s right if I</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.730" end="01:17:21.100" style="s2">actually lie yes okay so when you hype</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.030" end="01:17:24.100" style="s2">something for example I mean story time</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.100" end="01:17:25.510" style="s2">you do mythos you have to hike you have</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.100" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">to make it a little bit more grandiose</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.510" end="01:17:28.480" style="s2">than it actually so you leave go go some</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:31.420" style="s2">over to missus and that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.480" end="01:17:33.640" style="s2">lying right you spice it up right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.420" end="01:17:35.050" style="s2">otherwise you you won&#39;t get your Netflix</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.640" end="01:17:37.060" style="s2">script published unless you&#39;re spice it</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.050" end="01:17:38.890" style="s2">up a bit so you can&#39;t tell the real</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.060" end="01:17:41.950" style="s2">story because it&#39;s do boring now that</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.890" end="01:17:42.270" style="s2">that to me motivates the kid they could</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.950" end="01:17:44.010" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.270" end="01:17:45.810" style="s2">perfect ethical motivation while you</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.010" end="01:17:47.460" style="s2">would lie in that sense but to me the</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.810" end="01:17:49.230" style="s2">striking thing with Americans even the</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.460" end="01:17:51.060" style="s2">more low-key people who don&#39;t go to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.230" end="01:17:53.580" style="s2">hype don&#39;t do the sentiment tell any</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.060" end="01:17:55.260" style="s2">game you know a Peter Thiel he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.580" end="01:18:01.680" style="s2">genuine probably because the German as</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.260" end="01:18:03.210" style="s2">well but you know we&#39;d ban on I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.680" end="01:18:06.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a sense that what he did what</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.210" end="01:18:08.760" style="s2">is he&#39;s decided to do is that things are</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.030" end="01:18:10.080" style="s2">moving so fast but he trust that some of</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.760" end="01:18:12.510" style="s2">these clever working-class guys will</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.080" end="01:18:13.770" style="s2">figure out what he actually means so</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.510" end="01:18:16.080" style="s2">he&#39;s actually heading because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.770" end="01:18:18.060" style="s2">pathos he has a certain passion where</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.080" end="01:18:20.580" style="s2">he&#39;s going and that&#39;s his determination</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.060" end="01:18:22.410" style="s2">rather than the logical or explanation</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.580" end="01:18:25.380" style="s2">of what is the right thing to do and he</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.410" end="01:18:27.600" style="s2">definitely intuitive like mad genial</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.380" end="01:18:30.330" style="s2">intuitive that that to me proceeds a</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.600" end="01:18:33.930" style="s2">plastic character and and that&#39;s a zero</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.330" end="01:18:37.160" style="s2">and in this sense it&#39;s just like you</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.930" end="01:18:39.870" style="s2">just making it up as he goes along no no</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.160" end="01:18:41.910" style="s2">no no no no rendered my conscious is</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.870" end="01:18:44.010" style="s2">rather what you just said it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.910" end="01:18:46.140" style="s2">the crazy wisdom in him is something</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.010" end="01:18:48.270" style="s2">that the glitters what is does with in</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.140" end="01:18:49.710" style="s2">that he will not do anything in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.270" end="01:18:51.360" style="s2">predictable straightforward manner</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.710" end="01:18:53.310" style="s2">because that will make you lace in</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.360" end="01:18:54.810" style="s2">interpreting what he does blog that</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.310" end="01:18:56.160" style="s2">he&#39;ll move around very quickly here and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.810" end="01:18:57.690" style="s2">there but he will actually know what</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.160" end="01:19:00.150" style="s2">he&#39;s doing and he wouldn&#39;t mind a little</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.690" end="01:19:02.580" style="s2">white lie now and then for you to figure</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.150" end="01:19:04.290" style="s2">out the password maybe is more of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.580" end="01:19:06.750" style="s2">trickster character than yeah this&#39;n</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.290" end="01:19:10.980" style="s2">element to that yes in this sense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.750" end="01:19:12.750" style="s2">absolutely absolutely under I you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.980" end="01:19:15.420" style="s2">gonna hate me for for kind of retreating</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.750" end="01:19:21.120" style="s2">to a sort of answer of scientific remove</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.420" end="01:19:23.520" style="s2">here but I will say this to tell example</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.120" end="01:19:25.260" style="s2">that especially coming from his</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.520" end="01:19:27.810" style="s2">traditionalism there is a tension of</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.260" end="01:19:30.750" style="s2">whether or not anything anybody does</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.810" end="01:19:34.140" style="s2">means anything because because he does</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.750" end="01:19:35.700" style="s2">whole illusion right so Maya yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.140" end="01:19:40.710" style="s2">there&#39;s also there&#39;s also a schedule</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.700" end="01:19:43.200" style="s2">there&#39;s where fate is carrying us in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.710" end="01:19:46.050" style="s2">particular direction regardless of what</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.200" end="01:19:48.240" style="s2">we do you know Bannon moves in and out</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.050" end="01:19:49.830" style="s2">of that of that narrative in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.240" end="01:19:53.370" style="s2">can be confusing but when he isn&#39;t when</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.830" end="01:19:55.080" style="s2">he is part of it it&#39;s not a stretch for</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.370" end="01:19:55.740" style="s2">us trying to understand what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.080" end="01:19:59.250" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.740" end="01:20:01.950" style="s2">that that would lead to some weakening</p>

<p begin="01:21:52.140" end="01:21:58.860" style="s2">he has looked at this you know what he</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.130" end="01:22:00.660" style="s2">sees as a breakdown and also sort of</p>

<p begin="01:22:07.200" end="01:22:11.790" style="s2">of thing that he doesn&#39;t even need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.050" end="01:22:14.850" style="s2">you know I had a big long interview with</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.790" end="01:22:17.340" style="s2">him ahead of an article I wrote where</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.850" end="01:22:18.750" style="s2">where he&#39;s you know he was giving me all</p>

<p begin="01:22:18.750" end="01:22:21.900" style="s2">virus they&#39;re they&#39;re very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.280" end="01:22:24.180" style="s2">of course a lot was focusing on China</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.900" end="01:22:27.270" style="s2">that&#39;s his that&#39;s his main focus these</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.180" end="01:22:29.190" style="s2">days you know but as for global as</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.270" end="01:22:30.720" style="s2">globalization globalism I said well</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.190" end="01:22:32.700" style="s2">isn&#39;t this punishing global and he was</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.720" end="01:22:34.200" style="s2">like oh yeah of course you know he</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.700" end="01:22:37.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t even really want it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.200" end="01:22:39.090" style="s2">it was given for him that globalism is</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.050" end="01:22:40.560" style="s2">being picked apart right now and this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.090" end="01:22:41.910" style="s2">a tool of it but he didn&#39;t need to you</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.560" end="01:22:46.860" style="s2">need to say anything about it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.910" end="01:22:49.380" style="s2">gonna happen and I I think that you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.860" end="01:22:52.050" style="s2">where&#39;s a lot of commentators will see</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.380" end="01:22:53.820" style="s2">you know transparent dishonesty</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.050" end="01:22:55.260" style="s2">sometimes playing with the facts when</p>

<p begin="01:22:59.100" end="01:23:02.550" style="s2">here that&#39;s a lot of what this study a</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.720" end="01:23:04.530" style="s2">lot of what my book is about is really</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.550" end="01:23:07.110" style="s2">about motivations it&#39;s not so much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.530" end="01:23:09.900" style="s2">it&#39;s really a book of ideas masquerading</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.110" end="01:23:11.550" style="s2">as one about actions yeah but there can</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.900" end="01:23:14.010" style="s2">be a deeper motivation here and that yes</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.550" end="01:23:16.530" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t actually care that</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.010" end="01:23:18.300" style="s2">much about the detail you know the</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.530" end="01:23:23.100" style="s2">surface level of what he&#39;s saying it is</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.300" end="01:23:25.230" style="s2">a bigger picture narrative so one you</p>

<p begin="01:23:44.430" end="01:23:50.460" style="s2">outmaneuvered by the the kind of free</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.610" end="01:23:53.040" style="s2">market forces and the socialist forces</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.460" end="01:23:54.000" style="s2">coming together to unite and keep them</p>

<p begin="01:23:54.000" end="01:23:58.590" style="s2">the you know the far right and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.480" end="01:24:00.150" style="s2">person that I was speaking to in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.590" end="01:24:03.890" style="s2">Sweden Democrats thought that this was a</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.150" end="01:24:06.630" style="s2">great thing actually yes they lost power</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.890" end="01:24:08.220" style="s2">they didn&#39;t get they don&#39;t have they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:24:16.230" end="01:24:22.170" style="s2">materialism he saw economics socialism</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.650" end="01:24:24.440" style="s2">versus capitalism he saw that</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.170" end="01:24:27.330" style="s2">primary what had been the definitive</p>

<p begin="01:24:44.510" end="01:24:49.710" style="s2">transition politics you know to him</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.699" end="01:24:51.179" style="s2">meant not necessarily the political</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.710" end="01:24:52.770" style="s2">spectrum was moving to the left or to</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.179" end="01:24:56.190" style="s2">the right but that it essentially moved</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.770" end="01:24:58.890" style="s2">up right materialism up in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.190" end="01:25:00.300" style="s2">towards he&#39;s got to be exciting here</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.890" end="01:25:02.010" style="s2">miss Condon had to fall at the next ten</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.300" end="01:25:03.570" style="s2">years I&#39;m a member of the citizens</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.010" end="01:25:04.560" style="s2">gathering which is the next new party</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.570" end="01:25:06.750" style="s2">and they we&#39;ve got they&#39;ll turn it to</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.560" end="01:25:09.090" style="s2">Sweden and the citizens gathering it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.750" end="01:25:10.440" style="s2">like we take on a cosmopolitan liberal</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.090" end="01:25:13.260" style="s2">approach but with the integration</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.440" end="01:25:14.969" style="s2">policies have to work very fragmented</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.260" end="01:25:17.040" style="s2">approach and we hate political</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.969" end="01:25:18.660" style="s2">correctness which is very refreshing so</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.040" end="01:25:21.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like if your political correct</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.660" end="01:25:22.890" style="s2">don&#39;t even bother to join us totally</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.480" end="01:25:25.650" style="s2">opposed to de stablishment parts and</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.890" end="01:25:28.020" style="s2">again it&#39;s the is a population against</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.650" end="01:25:29.850" style="s2">establishment so basically the citizens</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.020" end="01:25:31.560" style="s2">gatherings got gonna go for the educated</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.850" end="01:25:33.690" style="s2">middle classes who are bored with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.560" end="01:25:35.130" style="s2">system and then Sweden Democrats are</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.690" end="01:25:37.440" style="s2">picked up the working class and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.130" end="01:25:38.820" style="s2">basically sweeping away the Social</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.440" end="01:25:40.620" style="s2">Democrats and they probably will in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.820" end="01:25:42.449" style="s2">next election and then the third force</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.620" end="01:25:44.610" style="s2">is the one this little the ultimate old</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.449" end="01:25:47.400" style="s2">right alternative Sweden but we can be</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.610" end="01:25:49.560" style="s2">in conversation so it&#39;s just like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.400" end="01:25:50.850" style="s2">you know you have to eventually have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.560" end="01:25:54.540" style="s2">run politics to some kind of compromise</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.850" end="01:25:56.640" style="s2">but this is like a spiritual awakening</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.540" end="01:25:59.100" style="s2">that it&#39;s not afraid to speak about</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.640" end="01:26:00.960" style="s2">spirituality tied to politics yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.100" end="01:26:04.440" style="s2">happening in Scandinavia the most</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.960" end="01:26:06.179" style="s2">nihilistic supposedly secular part of</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.440" end="01:26:08.190" style="s2">the world well you know feminism has</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.179" end="01:26:10.469" style="s2">become a religion and in I&#39;d you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.190" end="01:26:11.820" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentalist religion too because</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.469" end="01:26:14.160" style="s2">people think they&#39;re not religious and</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.820" end="01:26:16.770" style="s2">you know in an intersectional ISM I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.160" end="01:26:18.480" style="s2">nobody&#39;s just forget about California</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.770" end="01:26:21.570" style="s2">you come to eat it&#39;s just like it is a</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.480" end="01:26:23.100" style="s2">state religion you must obey and so the</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.570" end="01:26:25.739" style="s2">reaction against this will of course be</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.100" end="01:26:27.150" style="s2">incredibly forceful and those are the</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.739" end="01:26:29.250" style="s2">Sweden Democrats are there already</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.150" end="01:26:30.929" style="s2">because they&#39;ve got my 25% of the</p>

<p begin="01:28:49.969" end="01:28:54.409" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly we sear in Scandinavia</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.610" end="01:28:55.789" style="s2">all these Kirby&#39;s you&#39;re wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.409" end="01:28:56.989" style="s2">immigrant kids come here they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.789" end="01:28:59.059" style="s2">watch Swedish television they do their</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.989" end="01:29:00.889" style="s2">own talk shows and YouTube and they just</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.059" end="01:29:02.630" style="s2">invite guys from the opposite side and</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.889" end="01:29:05.780" style="s2">these shows are pulling the entire</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.630" end="01:29:07.610" style="s2">audience now you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a no I</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.780" end="01:29:10.070" style="s2">think that&#39;s refreshing I think Bannen</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.610" end="01:29:14.030" style="s2">will be looked at in inside he looked as</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.070" end="01:29:17.179" style="s2">prophetic and I think ultimately he he</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.030" end="01:29:18.800" style="s2">was to want to point it out that seeing</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.179" end="01:29:20.750" style="s2">things decision six years ago to become</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.800" end="01:29:22.639" style="s2">the dictator of China for life was</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.750" end="01:29:23.809" style="s2">probably the most profound decision made</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.639" end="01:29:26.480" style="s2">the last fifty years in the most tragic</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.809" end="01:29:28.670" style="s2">one even for the Chinese and I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.480" end="01:29:30.500" style="s2">we&#39;re heading towards with invasion of</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.670" end="01:29:32.000" style="s2">Hong Kong as I call it this summer I</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.500" end="01:29:33.320" style="s2">think we&#39;re heading towards a real</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.000" end="01:29:35.420" style="s2">battle here between not China in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.320" end="01:29:37.940" style="s2">United States but clearly India Japan</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.420" end="01:29:39.020" style="s2">Korea Taiwan are all uniting and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.940" end="01:29:41.869" style="s2">where I want to work the next few years</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.020" end="01:29:44.420" style="s2">as well to figure out how they relate to</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.869" end="01:29:47.210" style="s2">these Chinese monolith which is nothing</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.420" end="01:29:50.300" style="s2">but a massive or rebellion horror State</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.210" end="01:29:52.699" style="s2">yeah that the Chinese are creating and</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.300" end="01:29:54.230" style="s2">and they the swept away the Taoism of</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.699" end="01:29:56.449" style="s2">the Buddhism and just complete this day</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.230" end="01:29:58.639" style="s2">with some kind of vulgar Confucian as&#39;</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.449" end="01:30:00.380" style="s2">and the most vulgar version of it just</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.639" end="01:30:02.480" style="s2">basically tea and ping looking himself</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.380" end="01:30:04.670" style="s2">of the new Mao but even Mao was smarter</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.480" end="01:30:06.349" style="s2">this is really dangerous right so I</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.670" end="01:30:08.030" style="s2">think banner will be remembered as the</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.349" end="01:30:09.679" style="s2">guy who came from the West United the</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.030" end="01:30:11.480" style="s2">working-class guys and made them figure</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.679" end="01:30:15.320" style="s2">out that China was the enemy not the</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.480" end="01:30:17.239" style="s2">Chinese but the China so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.320" end="01:30:20.929" style="s2">that&#39;s the next 20-30 years it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.239" end="01:30:25.159" style="s2">be his biggest contribution did you</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.929" end="01:30:29.929" style="s2">agree with that and you it could be yes</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.159" end="01:30:32.630" style="s2">I mean he as if we focus on that point I</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.929" end="01:30:34.369" style="s2">you know I did want to kind of put a bow</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.630" end="01:30:35.900" style="s2">on what we were speaking out before just</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.369" end="01:30:40.309" style="s2">just to underline the fact that there</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.900" end="01:30:42.440" style="s2">there can be a lot of deceptive strategy</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.309" end="01:30:48.409" style="s2">in the moves that Bannon is making that</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.440" end="01:30:50.539" style="s2">are lost to commentators but when it</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.409" end="01:30:52.940" style="s2">comes to his opposition to China I mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.539" end="01:30:56.659" style="s2">I would note that he has been identified</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.940" end="01:30:58.730" style="s2">as a threat to them if this received</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.659" end="01:31:00.230" style="s2">very little coverage I tried to get</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.730" end="01:31:01.480" style="s2">covered for it it really upset me that</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.230" end="01:31:04.510" style="s2">no one seemed to care but</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.480" end="01:31:08.219" style="s2">you know the CCP devoted a full two</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.510" end="01:31:10.480" style="s2">minutes on their main primetime</p>

<p begin="01:40:03.900" end="01:40:08.730" style="s2">think Biden was jumping look too quickly</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.170" end="01:40:11.100" style="s2">on to the black lives matter bandwagon</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.730" end="01:40:14.100" style="s2">full-scale by distancing himself from</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.100" end="01:40:16.710" style="s2">the u.s. police force I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.100" end="01:40:18.630" style="s2">anybody ever win a u.s. election being</p>

<p begin="01:40:18.630" end="01:40:22.020" style="s2">the u.s. police force especially not</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.550" end="01:40:24.120" style="s2">when America&#39;s got a more chaotic and</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.020" end="01:40:26.040" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna burn all summer I think that</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.120" end="01:40:29.280" style="s2">was a terrible mistake on Biden&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.040" end="01:40:30.600" style="s2">and Biden has only gone up when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.280" end="01:40:33.180" style="s2">kept his mouth shut</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.600" end="01:40:35.040" style="s2">and he goes down every time he opens his</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.180" end="01:40:36.960" style="s2">mouth now I don&#39;t think you can win a</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.040" end="01:40:39.060" style="s2">use election or when the debates that</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.960" end="01:40:40.680" style="s2">actually are there before because Trump</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.060" end="01:40:42.210" style="s2">will just go in the repeat his mantra</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.680" end="01:40:43.980" style="s2">that&#39;s what he always does and I think</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.210" end="01:40:45.600" style="s2">you can beat Biden quite easily by doing</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.980" end="01:40:47.940" style="s2">that because Biden doesn&#39;t have a spine</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.600" end="01:40:50.550" style="s2">at all it&#39;s nothing but a power play</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.940" end="01:40:52.350" style="s2">I thought Amy Klobuchar was fantastic we</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.550" end="01:40:55.500" style="s2">both met her in Colorado last year and</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.350" end="01:40:57.210" style="s2">and and yeah why not pick the gay guy</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.500" end="01:40:59.190" style="s2">who run Indiana successfully whatever</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.210" end="01:41:01.350" style="s2">Pete buddy but the Democrats lost and</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.190" end="01:41:04.680" style="s2">completely you know he just got back to</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.350" end="01:41:06.690" style="s2">the old establishment horrible feuds and</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.680" end="01:41:09.810" style="s2">things so finally they pick what Biden</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.690" end="01:41:12.150" style="s2">god it&#39;s just like up against Trump is</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.810" end="01:41:14.700" style="s2">like it&#39;s Trump&#39;s election to lose let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.150" end="01:41:18.060" style="s2">put it that way okay part of what it</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.700" end="01:41:19.920" style="s2">what did Ben and how did Ben and</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.060" end="01:41:22.590" style="s2">describe Trump in the book I remember he</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.920" end="01:41:27.180" style="s2">described Trump in this very what does</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.590" end="01:41:29.130" style="s2">he think of Trump well it&#39;s I I get a</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.180" end="01:41:31.800" style="s2">different command of action was that the</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.130" end="01:41:33.990" style="s2">the phrase I&#39;m looking for a man in time</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.800" end="01:41:36.210" style="s2">man in time that&#39;s it yeah do the second</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.990" end="01:41:39.540" style="s2">phrase I mean a tiptoe the way that I</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.210" end="01:41:41.190" style="s2">wrote this the the phrase itself in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.540" end="01:41:44.160" style="s2">way that he was speaking about Trump</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.190" end="01:41:47.730" style="s2">pointed me to a very very dark</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.160" end="01:41:50.730" style="s2">traditionalist named Sumitra Devi who</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.730" end="01:41:52.590" style="s2">was this this also is not a common</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.730" end="01:41:54.780" style="s2">phrase that you hear in political</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.590" end="01:41:57.500" style="s2">science classes she was a an esoteric</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.780" end="01:41:57.500" style="s2">Hitler wrist</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.300" end="01:42:05.600" style="s2">look that up she and he just threw that</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.120" end="01:42:08.150" style="s2">in there and in a casual conversation or</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.600" end="01:42:12.620" style="s2">something that&#39;s yes you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.150" end="01:42:14.660" style="s2">phase that we all move through but I</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.620" end="01:42:15.680" style="s2">guess I did that to have a few months to</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.660" end="01:42:18.500" style="s2">be honest about it but I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.680" end="01:42:22.700" style="s2">everything everyone did you gotta try</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.500" end="01:42:24.380" style="s2">everything yeah you know she she looked</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.700" end="01:42:25.730" style="s2">at that time cycle and thought okay the</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.380" end="01:42:28.850" style="s2">way that you actually advanced through</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.730" end="01:42:30.920" style="s2">it human beings can be actors in this in</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.850" end="01:42:33.590" style="s2">this otherwise fatalistic time cycle the</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.920" end="01:42:36.470" style="s2">way you do it is you propel it forward</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.590" end="01:42:38.840" style="s2">through destruction and if you were a</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.470" end="01:42:40.670" style="s2">force who destroys and has more violent</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.840" end="01:42:42.740" style="s2">than the average person then you are</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.670" end="01:42:45.080" style="s2">actually participating in time more than</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.740" end="01:42:46.910" style="s2">others you were distinguished and you</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.080" end="01:42:49.550" style="s2">are a man in time all these figures were</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.910" end="01:42:50.960" style="s2">men she thought and so she thought</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.550" end="01:42:54.800" style="s2">Hitler was a man in time because he was</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.960" end="01:42:57.140" style="s2">able to use use use violence to push</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.800" end="01:43:00.920" style="s2">things forward if you are not only</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.140" end="01:43:02.330" style="s2">someone who understands the truth of</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.920" end="01:43:03.620" style="s2">time but also participates in</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.330" end="01:43:05.420" style="s2">destruction then you can be a man</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.620" end="01:43:07.490" style="s2">against time that was part of her</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.420" end="01:43:09.710" style="s2">typology a man above time as someone who</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.490" end="01:43:11.660" style="s2">simply simply knows what&#39;s going on but</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.710" end="01:43:13.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t participate a man in time as</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.660" end="01:43:17.360" style="s2">someone who doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.190" end="01:43:19.370" style="s2">but participates bannin he not only</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.360" end="01:43:21.200" style="s2">dropped the phrase to me describing</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.370" end="01:43:23.510" style="s2">Trump as the man in time but then went</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.200" end="01:43:25.190" style="s2">on to say you know Trump&#39;s function and</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.510" end="01:43:28.490" style="s2">this is his ability to break down</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.190" end="01:43:30.770" style="s2">disrupt and destroy he doesn&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.490" end="01:43:32.780" style="s2">and this was the key is that you know he</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.770" end="01:43:34.010" style="s2">destroys he is this incredible force for</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.780" end="01:43:36.710" style="s2">destruction but he doesn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.010" end="01:43:39.110" style="s2">understand his role in history that is a</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.710" end="01:43:43.730" style="s2">man in time that&#39;s how Savitri Devi</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.110" end="01:43:45.770" style="s2">describes it Wow so and implicitly in</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.730" end="01:43:47.450" style="s2">all this someone who is participating in</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.770" end="01:43:49.730" style="s2">the disruption a destruction but knows</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.450" end="01:43:53.060" style="s2">what it is that&#39;s a man against time</p>
