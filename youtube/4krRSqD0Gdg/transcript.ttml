<p begin="00:02:49.060" end="00:02:54.040" style="s2">and what I think is a really important</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.150" end="00:02:56.230" style="s2">piece like I&#39;ve been certainly very</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.040" end="00:02:57.970" style="s2">influenced by integral and think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.230" end="00:03:01.329" style="s2">the developmental framework has a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.970" end="00:03:02.859" style="s2">add to this emergent conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.329" end="00:03:04.510" style="s2">Jordan Pederson has helped to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.859" end="00:03:09.310" style="s2">spark the intellectual dark where as</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.510" end="00:03:10.930" style="s2">part of it and I&#39;m I know that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.310" end="00:03:13.299" style="s2">got a background with the integral</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.930" end="00:03:16.780" style="s2">community and you&#39;re also one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.299" end="00:03:18.639" style="s2">most inspiring thinkers that we&#39;ve met</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.780" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2">in the time that we&#39;ve been doing this I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.639" end="00:03:22.090" style="s2">was really impressed with the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.750" end="00:03:24.459" style="s2">that we put out with you I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.090" end="00:03:26.859" style="s2">holding a really key piece so I want and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.459" end="00:03:28.900" style="s2">I I&#39;m fascinated you have a history with</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.859" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">integral as well I wonder if you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.900" end="00:03:33.189" style="s2">want to sort of go through that for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:35.260" style="s2">sure I mean I think I was I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.189" end="00:03:37.269" style="s2">teaching at a boarding school in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.260" end="00:03:39.579" style="s2">California right after grad school so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.269" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">was in my early 20s and the headmaster</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.579" end="00:03:44.349" style="s2">gave me Ken&#39;s brief history of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:46.930" style="s2">everything and said you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.349" end="00:03:50.470" style="s2">read this and I and I jumped into it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.930" end="00:03:52.030" style="s2">found that his descriptions of upper</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.470" end="00:03:53.889" style="s2">stages of development and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.030" end="00:03:56.620" style="s2">particularly I think he talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.889" end="00:03:57.940" style="s2">aftershocks of ego death experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.620" end="00:04:00.280" style="s2">the little ghosts that come back</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.940" end="00:04:03.310" style="s2">afterwards and I remember it was such a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.280" end="00:04:04.750" style="s2">lifesaver for me at the time and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.310" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">dived in that book and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.750" end="00:04:08.169" style="s2">probably the densest thing I&#39;d ever read</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:12.220" style="s2">for fun you know not actually assigned</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.169" end="00:04:15.630" style="s2">and that really opened my open my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.220" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">and open my world to everything from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.630" end="00:04:22.330" style="s2">validation of interior experiences to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">the notion of adult development and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.330" end="00:04:25.690" style="s2">vertical development and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:28.599" style="s2">sense that we don&#39;t just stop at puberty</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.690" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">or stop you know in our 20s and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.599" end="00:04:33.370" style="s2">found it immensely valuable as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:35.949" style="s2">initial kind of orienting framework and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.370" end="00:04:39.250" style="s2">then even sort of virusscan on thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.949" end="00:04:40.690" style="s2">and making sense of things and then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.250" end="00:04:44.050" style="s2">went a bit more deeply into it as well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.690" end="00:04:46.090" style="s2">think we did we were you know educators</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.050" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">by you know I was sort of historian</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.090" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">anthropologist by academic training and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:53.260" style="s2">then was working deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:55.810" style="s2">in basically developmentally informed</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.260" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">education ranging from Montessori to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.810" end="00:04:58.150" style="s2">Knowles which is sort of like an</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:04:59.770" style="s2">outward-bound</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.150" end="00:05:01.150" style="s2">kind of version of you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.770" end="00:05:03.040" style="s2">take people into expeditionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.150" end="00:05:05.860" style="s2">environments and and learn and train and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.040" end="00:05:07.900" style="s2">then play a role with the integral</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.860" end="00:05:09.700" style="s2">education community standing that up</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.900" end="00:05:12.280" style="s2">which was a kind of a subset or branch</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.700" end="00:05:14.920" style="s2">of Ken&#39;s integral Institute in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.280" end="00:05:17.350" style="s2">of early 2000s and then as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.920" end="00:05:19.870" style="s2">that work was actually recruited by one</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.350" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">of only two sort of truly integral</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.870" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">management consulting firms and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">went into the corporate space along with</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:29.140" style="s2">John Mackey who was the founder of Whole</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.190" end="00:05:36.610" style="s2">is a global organization of business</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:38.260" style="s2">leaders that&#39;s very it&#39;s quite powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.610" end="00:05:41.500" style="s2">they control about nine trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.260" end="00:05:43.480" style="s2">in global market cap and we conducted a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.500" end="00:05:45.670" style="s2">series of experiments over the better</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.480" end="00:05:48.490" style="s2">part of a decade on how do you bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.670" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">integrally informed development</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.810" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">been a wild ride and a fun experiment</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:05.290" style="s2">yeah because I I guess the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:06.820" style="s2">interesting thing about both Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.290" end="00:06:08.710" style="s2">Peterson and the intellectual diet over</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.820" end="00:06:12.940" style="s2">in this kind of networked conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.710" end="00:06:14.920" style="s2">is that it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of open to fit</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.940" end="00:06:16.510" style="s2">it&#39;s in the new digital age so it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.920" end="00:06:20.350" style="s2">to be open to feedback it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.510" end="00:06:23.590" style="s2">open to evolution and that&#39;s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.350" end="00:06:25.270" style="s2">what I&#39;m really interested in in being</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.590" end="00:06:27.910" style="s2">part of that cuz I think integral has a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.270" end="00:06:29.650" style="s2">really interesting and valuable point to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.910" end="00:06:32.830" style="s2">bring but there are also I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.650" end="00:06:35.320" style="s2">lessons that can be learned of integral</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.830" end="00:06:37.240" style="s2">successes and integrals failures because</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.320" end="00:06:41.350" style="s2">there was a huge high point of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.240" end="00:06:44.200" style="s2">probably in the 90s and 2000&#39;s and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.350" end="00:06:45.790" style="s2">question is whether it had the impact</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.200" end="00:06:49.630" style="s2">that it that it should have had all</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.790" end="00:06:52.180" style="s2">could have had and also what we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.630" end="00:06:54.580" style="s2">learn from it if we&#39;re involved in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.180" end="00:06:56.320" style="s2">of the same questions now and I I guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.580" end="00:06:57.670" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve had a lot of experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.320" end="00:07:00.700" style="s2">right at the sharp end of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.670" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">conversation yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.700" end="00:07:04.310" style="s2">and and it does feel there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:06.950" style="s2">things it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.310" end="00:07:10.010" style="s2">the thought leaders today and whether</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.950" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s in the crypto space and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.010" end="00:07:13.070" style="s2">about kind of decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:16.100" style="s2">organizations or whether it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.070" end="00:07:17.960" style="s2">existential risk or even kind of in more</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.100" end="00:07:19.940" style="s2">sophisticated versions of personal</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.960" end="00:07:23.030" style="s2">development and leadership development I</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.940" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">have noticed that even without teasing</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.030" end="00:07:26.890" style="s2">it out or calling it out it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:30.260" style="s2">bubbles up in conversations that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.890" end="00:07:32.360" style="s2">significant number of those folks took</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.260" end="00:07:33.980" style="s2">on and can seriously considered integral</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.360" end="00:07:35.240" style="s2">frameworks at some point earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.980" end="00:07:37.580" style="s2">their life so I think that&#39;s just kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.240" end="00:07:40.070" style="s2">of interesting to note equally</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.580" end="00:07:42.050" style="s2">interesting to note no one is branding</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.070" end="00:07:44.570" style="s2">their work their movement or ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.050" end="00:07:46.430" style="s2">that way these days and so that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.570" end="00:07:48.890" style="s2">kind of a you know a curiosity but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.430" end="00:07:50.870" style="s2">think also a four hat tip to the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.890" end="00:07:53.420" style="s2">ongoing significance of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.870" end="00:07:55.160" style="s2">integral Institute diaspora you know I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.420" end="00:07:57.950" style="s2">think it was sort of a Schumpeter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.160" end="00:07:59.960" style="s2">creative destruction writ large where an</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.950" end="00:08:02.210" style="s2">awful lot of fascinating people were</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.210" end="00:08:07.220" style="s2">it imploded exploded depending on your</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.760" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">point of view its scattered and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.220" end="00:08:11.510" style="s2">dispersed a lot of those people but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:15.170" style="s2">relationships and the shared ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.510" end="00:08:17.000" style="s2">persisted and borne a lot of fruit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.170" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">you said what I thought was a really</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.000" end="00:08:22.280" style="s2">beautiful metaphor that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:25.670" style="s2">breaking trail are running an integral</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.280" end="00:08:28.100" style="s2">OS yeah and I think some of the simplest</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.670" end="00:08:31.130" style="s2">thing is a the complexity of thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.100" end="00:08:33.800" style="s2">those ways the valuing that there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:36.230" style="s2">interior experiences that are as</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.800" end="00:08:39.110" style="s2">important and map and track as exterior</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.230" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">experiences and that things that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.110" end="00:08:44.900" style="s2">might talk about in the realms of policy</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:46.820" style="s2">government business you know aka sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.900" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">third-person structures are also</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.820" end="00:08:53.390" style="s2">informed by and connected to culture and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:54.980" style="s2">interior psychology and just that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.390" end="00:08:57.140" style="s2">ability I mean fundamentally the four</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.980" end="00:08:59.470" style="s2">quadrants of Ken&#39;s model there&#39;s insides</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.140" end="00:09:02.870" style="s2">and outsides of singulars and plurals</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.470" end="00:09:05.450" style="s2">that alone I think is game-changing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.870" end="00:09:07.550" style="s2">then a few others if you know what Ken</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.450" end="00:09:10.430" style="s2">calls the pre Tron&#39;s fallacy you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.550" end="00:09:12.290" style="s2">don&#39;t confuse irrational things with</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.430" end="00:09:14.060" style="s2">post rational things</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.290" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">and particularly you know the terrain</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.060" end="00:09:17.180" style="s2">that we read about in a stealing fire</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">talking about the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.180" end="00:09:21.139" style="s2">Renaissance the explosion and state</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.449" end="00:09:30.259" style="s2">this kind of immense hunger these days</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.089" end="00:09:32.089" style="s2">for all things non ordinary is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.259" end="00:09:34.579" style="s2">important to distinguish between what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.089" end="00:09:36.319" style="s2">regressive and just going back to kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.579" end="00:09:39.139" style="s2">of magical thinking and what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.319" end="00:09:41.899" style="s2">progressive we&#39;re truly stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.139" end="00:09:45.800" style="s2">some increasingly complex and helpful</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.899" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">new ways of looking at stuff and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.800" end="00:09:50.029" style="s2">mentioned a few there but what do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.420" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">think of a are the really crucial pieces</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.029" end="00:09:55.069" style="s2">that integral provides what are the what</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:58.040" style="s2">are the most important parts of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.069" end="00:09:59.630" style="s2">integral os I think I just named them</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.040" end="00:10:01.069" style="s2">really I mean I think it&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.630" end="00:10:02.449" style="s2">interiors and exteriors and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.069" end="00:10:05.509" style="s2">they&#39;re equally important to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.449" end="00:10:08.600" style="s2">considered that notion of the pre trans</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.509" end="00:10:10.430" style="s2">fallacy don&#39;t confuse less sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.600" end="00:10:12.139" style="s2">things for more sophisticated things</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:15.860" style="s2">simply because they&#39;re not standard</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.139" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">business as usual the notions of adult</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.860" end="00:10:20.110" style="s2">development or vertical development were</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:22.610" style="s2">both I think they were helpfully wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.110" end="00:10:23.930" style="s2">is the simplest way to say it and I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.610" end="00:10:26.810" style="s2">actually just having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.930" end="00:10:29.540" style="s2">Zack Stein who studied at Harvard did</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.810" end="00:10:31.149" style="s2">his doctorate under Bob Keegan and some</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.540" end="00:10:33.949" style="s2">of the other developmental theorists and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.149" end="00:10:36.529" style="s2">you know Ken&#39;s model which he then kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.949" end="00:10:38.240" style="s2">of piggy back to spiral dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.529" end="00:10:40.490" style="s2">those kinds of things the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.240" end="00:10:42.620" style="s2">there&#39;s such a thing as second-tier that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.490" end="00:10:44.630" style="s2">second tier is this momentous leap that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.620" end="00:10:46.730" style="s2">if you&#39;re even here this conference</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.630" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">we&#39;re reading this book aka one of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.730" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2">you are parentheses at least cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">at second tier I think that created far</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.100" end="00:10:56.329" style="s2">more problems than it&#39;s solved and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:58.430" style="s2">basically was like crack for Asperger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.329" end="00:11:01.370" style="s2">kids you know the idea of getting a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.430" end="00:11:03.980" style="s2">contact high from reading Ken&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.370" end="00:11:06.500" style="s2">and getting to see yourself on a map and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.980" end="00:11:08.060" style="s2">position yourself up and away from no</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.500" end="00:11:09.709" style="s2">matter what the disclaimers were and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.060" end="00:11:12.589" style="s2">there were plenty of disclaimers the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.709" end="00:11:15.310" style="s2">reality as that showed up in culture and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.589" end="00:11:19.579" style="s2">in practice resulted in a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.310" end="00:11:22.459" style="s2">dissociated eggheads masquerading as as</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.579" end="00:11:24.430" style="s2">Jedi and thinking that they could solve</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.459" end="00:11:26.890" style="s2">the world from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.430" end="00:11:28.029" style="s2">of a whiteboard and that I think was you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.890" end="00:11:31.240" style="s2">know part of the cracks in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.029" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">foundation I guess I was relatively late</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.240" end="00:11:37.390" style="s2">to to discovering Ken&#39;s work and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:40.899" style="s2">been very impressed with it but it but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.390" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">also get a sense like a lot of integral</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.899" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">forums or integral conversations just</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">tend to degenerate into I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:49.720" style="s2">integral than you this sort of integral</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.720" end="00:11:53.740" style="s2">yeah and that was what was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.490" end="00:11:56.380" style="s2">precious about it you know within the</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.390" end="00:15:42.010" style="s2">experience came from what I could tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.850" end="00:15:44.890" style="s2">from the Adi Dada lineage there was a</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.730" end="00:16:11.810" style="s2">people who were already awake got there</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.530" end="00:16:14.930" style="s2">some by other means and then were drawn</p>

<p begin="00:16:32.510" end="00:16:35.690" style="s2">said I thought you were holding a really</p>

<p begin="00:16:37.820" end="00:16:42.350" style="s2">of time with you I think is that</p>

<p begin="00:16:42.350" end="00:16:46.850" style="s2">minds get into the the liminal</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:52.550" style="s2">bringing and that&#39;s the piece you say</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:54.290" style="s2">that was not present with integral yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.550" end="00:16:55.820" style="s2">I mean you know we&#39;ve all got our biases</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.290" end="00:16:58.070" style="s2">so we for sure you know we can only</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.920" end="00:17:06.800" style="s2">traditions he wildly privileged those</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.910" end="00:17:10.870" style="s2">and he was a weightlifter body builder</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.800" end="00:17:14.150" style="s2">judo so so that became his triangle of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.870" end="00:17:16.100" style="s2">proving it to academia Eastern and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.150" end="00:17:18.230" style="s2">particularly you know some Shen and some</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.320" end="00:17:32.270" style="s2">this is this is embodiment and so those</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.810" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">notion of like crack fries burgers kids</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.700" end="00:26:32.870" style="s2">it&#39;s just too clever for its own fucking</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.550" style="s2">good and that&#39;s not to say that certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.870" end="00:26:36.010" style="s2">clever people want to think in that way</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.550" end="00:26:37.780" style="s2">or right in that way</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.500" end="00:26:51.400" style="s2">it was it was almost the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.870" end="00:26:52.930" style="s2">you know like in Raiders of the Lost Ark</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.400" end="00:26:54.370" style="s2">you know Indiana Jones goes out into</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.930" end="00:26:56.230" style="s2">that Moroccan square and there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.370" end="00:26:57.700" style="s2">black Saracen and he&#39;s whips out his</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.230" end="00:26:59.080" style="s2">scimitar and does all this fancy ass</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.700" end="00:27:01.300" style="s2">stuff and then that you know Indy just</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.080" end="00:27:04.090" style="s2">picks out his gun and shoots him right</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.300" end="00:27:05.890" style="s2">and and that&#39;s kind of life and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.090" end="00:27:08.470" style="s2">aqwal theory was a little bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.890" end="00:27:13.110" style="s2">dude with the scimitar which is an awful</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.470" end="00:27:15.820" style="s2">lot of arm waving without nearly enough</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.750" end="00:27:22.930" style="s2">and do you have any other criticisms or</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.440" end="00:27:24.190" style="s2">thoughts about it yeah I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.930" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">there&#39;s been lots of solid and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.190" end="00:27:28.090" style="s2">methodical breakdowns of you know where</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:29.590" style="s2">integral Theory got out over its key</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.090" end="00:27:31.480" style="s2">specifically its orienting</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.590" end="00:27:34.570" style="s2">generalizations and you know presuming</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.480" end="00:27:36.220" style="s2">to define entire academic disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.570" end="00:27:38.020" style="s2">with a certain straw man that then would</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.220" end="00:27:40.210" style="s2">get knocked down I think ken was clearly</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.020" end="00:27:42.130" style="s2">strongest in the realm of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.210" end="00:27:43.750" style="s2">psychology and Eastern Kentucky of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.130" end="00:27:45.280" style="s2">traditions and that and that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.750" end="00:27:46.600" style="s2">that&#39;s his earlier work for the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.280" end="00:27:48.280" style="s2">part and it&#39;s you know that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.600" end="00:27:51.040" style="s2">think he was really drawing from his</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.280" end="00:27:53.410" style="s2">wheelhouse the so there&#39;s critiques</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.040" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">there kind of within the ad within the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.410" end="00:27:58.180" style="s2">frameworks and that&#39;s been done but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:02.050" style="s2">biggest one the biggest - for me we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.180" end="00:28:04.950" style="s2">simply the notion of it didn&#39;t work as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.050" end="00:28:07.900" style="s2">business nor did any other businesses</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.950" end="00:28:11.290" style="s2">find ways to make it work so just pure</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.900" end="00:28:14.260" style="s2">proof of concept product market fit and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.290" end="00:28:16.510" style="s2">the other one which i think is as big is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.260" end="00:28:19.210" style="s2">one of integrals biggest you know true</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.510" end="00:28:20.740" style="s2">claims to fame was that Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.210" end="00:28:22.060" style="s2">contemplative traditions are partial</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.740" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">because they don&#39;t address psychological</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.060" end="00:28:26.230" style="s2">shadow Western psychological traditions</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.900" style="s2">don&#39;t address non-dual ness</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.230" end="00:28:31.090" style="s2">or or sort of attainment and integral is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.900" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">the best of both worlds because we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.090" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">non giannis with awareness of shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:40.270" style="s2">then ken promptly went on to endorse</p>

<p begin="00:29:07.830" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">because if the very thing we said we</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.050" end="00:29:16.740" style="s2">could do we consistently spectacularly</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.040" end="00:29:38.850" style="s2">that specifically I mean obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.270" end="00:29:40.350" style="s2">the humans involved and and on some</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.850" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">level is there some mutual back</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.350" end="00:29:45.900" style="s2">scratching as peers and colleagues agree</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.390" end="00:29:54.870" style="s2">happens even more these days with</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.870" end="00:29:58.410" style="s2">all that kind of stuff so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.070" end="00:30:01.110" style="s2">there&#39;s many times that people will look</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.410" end="00:30:03.890" style="s2">the other way over small things and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.110" end="00:30:07.140" style="s2">large because of reach and scope and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.890" end="00:30:09.900" style="s2">mutual benefit but I think fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:13.470" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it was hubris and and anybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.900" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">that proclaims a model of everything is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.470" end="00:30:18.450" style="s2">gonna miss something that something</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:21.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t show up on that map and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.790" end="00:30:30.350" style="s2">I mean for me my sensory is anything</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.960" end="00:30:43.970" style="s2">realization that is extraordinary first</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.720" end="00:30:47.030" style="s2">you know I think that you set yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.970" end="00:30:50.270" style="s2">up for the bifurcation the accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.030" end="00:30:53.179" style="s2">of shadow it seems I mean you basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.270" end="00:30:56.570" style="s2">just hinted at that there like this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.179" end="00:31:00.950" style="s2">Eastern model of enlightenment as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.570" end="00:31:02.990" style="s2">of final destination just seems to be is</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.990" end="00:31:08.410" style="s2">as soon as any personal organization is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.960" end="00:31:13.900" style="s2">built around that model it just almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.410" end="00:31:16.130" style="s2">invariably seems to end up in shadow</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.900" end="00:31:18.860" style="s2">yeah I mean I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.130" end="00:31:20.630" style="s2">biggest problems in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.860" end="00:31:23.870" style="s2">spiritual marketplace in general and</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:44.620" style="s2">together with that is something along</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.270" end="00:31:47.929" style="s2">the lines of there is such a thing as</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.929" end="00:31:53.990" style="s2">and I think whether or not there are</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.480" end="00:32:04.490" style="s2">think it&#39;s a shitty teaching technique</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.250" end="00:32:07.010" style="s2">regardless and so because what happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.490" end="00:32:10.669" style="s2">is the moment a person in the position</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.110" end="00:32:28.549" style="s2">then even when there&#39;s clearly some</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.750" end="00:32:31.610" style="s2">stuff I&#39;m doing this batshit crazy out</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.549" end="00:32:32.310" style="s2">of line I can&#39;t go hey you&#39;re right I</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.610" end="00:32:35.190" style="s2">had a bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.310" end="00:32:37.890" style="s2">I have to hold behind that Plexiglas</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.190" end="00:32:38.970" style="s2">wall and say I must I&#39;m still perfect</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.890" end="00:32:40.800" style="s2">therefore I did that on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.970" end="00:32:42.930" style="s2">therefore even though it seemed like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.800" end="00:32:46.020" style="s2">shitty thing it&#39;s actually crazy wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.930" end="00:32:48.090" style="s2">in service of your awakening and therein</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.020" end="00:32:51.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the beginning of the end and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.090" end="00:32:54.660" style="s2">every time I come across any teacher or</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.810" end="00:32:56.820" style="s2">teaching that is making any claims along</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.660" end="00:32:59.670" style="s2">those lines you like don&#39;t go near it no</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.820" end="00:33:02.010" style="s2">matter how alive a light shining no</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.670" end="00:33:03.510" style="s2">matter how much they&#39;re waking people up</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.010" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">with charismatic transmission</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.510" end="00:33:08.280" style="s2">it just feels problematic and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:10.980" style="s2">why teachers like Pema Chodron you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.280" end="00:33:12.570" style="s2">who emphasize our humanity you know I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.980" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">mean I think in a nutshell I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.570" end="00:33:18.750" style="s2">spirituality is wildly overrated and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:21.300" style="s2">think our core humanity is wildly</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.750" end="00:33:24.450" style="s2">underrated and so the teachers that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.300" end="00:33:26.160" style="s2">can get behind other ones Pema Chodron</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.450" end="00:33:29.040" style="s2">Alice Walker as you know it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.160" end="00:33:32.100" style="s2">wisdom holder adyashanti like folks who</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.040" end="00:33:35.220" style="s2">are like yeah this is it this is us and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.100" end="00:33:37.860" style="s2">and get used to it and the way out is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.220" end="00:33:41.280" style="s2">through the way out is down and in up</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.860" end="00:33:45.810" style="s2">and away those those experiences just</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.280" end="00:33:50.190" style="s2">feel more honest to me and we don&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.810" end="00:33:54.300" style="s2">up in the schizoid effort to reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.190" end="00:33:56.450" style="s2">than that the utter tragedy that is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.300" end="00:33:59.700" style="s2">human experience with all of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:03.720" style="s2">ascendant so-called spiritual states or</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.700" end="00:34:05.220" style="s2">experiences do you think I&#39;m guessing</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.720" end="00:34:08.250" style="s2">the answer might well be no but do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.220" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">think that integral has some relevance</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.250" end="00:34:13.950" style="s2">or could could still be relevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:16.290" style="s2">conversation today yeah I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.950" end="00:34:17.669" style="s2">great question in some respects the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.290" end="00:34:19.710" style="s2">advice I always give folks is I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.669" end="00:34:22.470" style="s2">that integral theory should be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.710" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">studied and then promptly forgotten you</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.470" end="00:34:27.840" style="s2">know like keep it as kind of operating</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:30.450" style="s2">system virusscan keep it as kind of pegs</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.840" end="00:34:32.040" style="s2">to hang things on keep it in or use it</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.450" end="00:34:33.750" style="s2">as a sort of rubric</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.040" end="00:34:37.080" style="s2">against which you check to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.750" end="00:34:40.230" style="s2">you&#39;re not missing something obvious but</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.080" end="00:34:43.100" style="s2">in general the I just don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.230" end="00:34:47.900" style="s2">life submits</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.100" end="00:34:52.220" style="s2">to that form of false precision very</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.170" end="00:35:56.210" style="s2">the growth to goodness idea the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.630" end="00:35:58.790" style="s2">that in vertical development we end up</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.180" end="00:37:11.380" style="s2">so then there&#39;s been research on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">spread of EQ or emotional intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.380" end="00:37:17.500" style="s2">training and findings that the worst</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:20.410" style="s2">thing you can possibly do is teach EQ</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.410" end="00:37:24.099" style="s2">pick up culture was a you know hat which</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.390" end="00:37:27.069" style="s2">has weird overlaps with the integral</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.099" end="00:37:29.829" style="s2">community via some of the communication</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.069" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">dialogue processes started out as pickup</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.619" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">use of the force gives you death they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.420" end="00:37:46.630" style="s2">and so I think it&#39;s really critical back</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.780" end="00:39:46.089" style="s2">your thoughts because of it as I said at</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.410" end="00:39:48.309" style="s2">the beginning the the nature of the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.089" end="00:39:51.400" style="s2">internet and the the kind of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.309" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">conversation is that it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.400" end="00:39:56.829" style="s2">two-way and there is a sense with I know</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:39:58.839" style="s2">that there&#39;s a sense within a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.829" end="00:40:00.309" style="s2">people who are following integral that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.839" end="00:40:02.170" style="s2">integral needs to be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.309" end="00:40:04.390" style="s2">conversation it needs to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.170" end="00:40:06.329" style="s2">developmental framework for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.390" end="00:40:09.460" style="s2">would really help inform the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.329" end="00:40:10.900" style="s2">intellectual darkweb argument but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.460" end="00:40:14.950" style="s2">think for that to happen it would also</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.900" end="00:40:18.339" style="s2">need for integral and Ken to be open to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.950" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">to feedback into dialogue in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.339" end="00:40:22.869" style="s2">perhaps we haven&#39;t seen so far do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:24.069" style="s2">think that they are open to that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.869" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">mean I haven&#39;t touched base in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.069" end="00:40:27.220" style="s2">world and honestly I mean my sense where</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.900" end="00:40:29.049" style="s2">where it can</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.220" end="00:40:31.180" style="s2">lost the most relevance other than the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.049" end="00:40:35.980" style="s2">kind of collapse of integral Institute</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.180" end="00:40:38.170" style="s2">was in the no longer going ban I get it</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.980" end="00:40:39.670" style="s2">like when you&#39;ve got a complex thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.170" end="00:40:41.890" style="s2">structure and you&#39;re interested on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.670" end="00:40:44.470" style="s2">leading edge of your newest ideas having</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.890" end="00:40:46.510" style="s2">to go back and re-establish all this all</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.140" end="00:40:54.760" style="s2">know almost glibly</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.839" end="00:40:56.559" style="s2">chakra systems or subtle energy or</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.760" end="00:40:59.890" style="s2">things that are very far off the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.559" end="00:41:01.799" style="s2">reservation even skeptical enthusiasts</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.890" end="00:41:04.839" style="s2">and discussing them as if they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.799" end="00:41:06.309" style="s2">established facts that to me is</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.839" end="00:41:08.700" style="s2">problematic you&#39;re like okay you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.309" end="00:41:11.410" style="s2">broken with any efforts to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.700" end="00:41:13.990" style="s2">relevance to the middle of the bell</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:15.609" style="s2">curve including including someone like</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.990" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">me who just prefer</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.609" end="00:41:20.799" style="s2">a sort of agnostic Gnosticism he prefers</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:22.869" style="s2">a kind of rational mysticism versus</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.799" end="00:41:26.650" style="s2">taking other things on lock stock and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.869" end="00:41:30.849" style="s2">barrel the the feedback loops I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.650" end="00:41:34.239" style="s2">seen can being open to it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.849" end="00:41:35.559" style="s2">there&#39;s legitimate peevishness on his</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.239" end="00:41:38.499" style="s2">part in the same way that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.559" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">Peterson clearly got increasingly kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.499" end="00:41:43.269" style="s2">of hijacked and reactive you know before</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:45.640" style="s2">and immediately after the launch of his</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.269" end="00:41:47.259" style="s2">book as he was a taking and Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.640" end="00:41:49.029" style="s2">for that matter right just potshots and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.259" end="00:41:51.910" style="s2">slings and arrows and at some point you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.029" end="00:41:54.459" style="s2">take a swipe at the ankle-biters and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.910" end="00:41:56.380" style="s2">you know critiques it can you know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.459" end="00:41:58.529" style="s2">it&#39;s the wheat from the chaff really</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.380" end="00:42:00.940" style="s2">like the critiques of Ken that are just</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.529" end="00:42:03.819" style="s2">inflammatory reactionary don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.940" end="00:42:05.829" style="s2">caricature typecast yeah you know what</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.819" end="00:42:07.809" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a waste of time to have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.829" end="00:42:11.640" style="s2">sift through those if you&#39;ve got actual</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.809" end="00:42:15.130" style="s2">Dhamma real work to go and do but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.640" end="00:42:16.779" style="s2">considered open-hearted critiques have</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.130" end="00:42:18.489" style="s2">to be met with something more than you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.779" end="00:42:20.259" style="s2">just don&#39;t understand the model or</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.489" end="00:42:23.170" style="s2">you&#39;re misinterpreting it has to be like</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.259" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">okay I&#39;ve got my boat the ship I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.170" end="00:42:27.369" style="s2">steering through the water and I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:29.259" style="s2">my wake and I don&#39;t always notice my</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.369" end="00:42:30.849" style="s2">wake but if it&#39;s upsetting other</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.259" end="00:42:32.829" style="s2">people&#39;s boats if it&#39;s slamming up</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.849" end="00:42:34.839" style="s2">against dachshunds whomping picnics I</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.829" end="00:42:37.449" style="s2">need to take responsibility for that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.839" end="00:42:41.199" style="s2">I think that that piece somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.449" end="00:42:43.900" style="s2">between the non-dual and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.199" end="00:42:45.880" style="s2">psychological is that is the span where</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.900" end="00:42:50.019" style="s2">ken was actually had the least vision</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.880" end="00:42:52.299" style="s2">and that was the messy human parts of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.019" end="00:42:54.910" style="s2">how we get this done together and there</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.299" end="00:42:59.949" style="s2">and the way we inform and are informed</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.910" end="00:43:03.069" style="s2">by each other and where is the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.949" end="00:43:06.279" style="s2">edge of the conversation now where where</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.069" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">should people go to if integral felt</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.279" end="00:43:10.089" style="s2">like the cutting edge of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:11.589" style="s2">conversation in sort of 90s 2000s where</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.089" end="00:43:17.349" style="s2">is that cutting edge right now do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.589" end="00:43:19.269" style="s2">think well I mean I think topically that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.349" end="00:43:21.699" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m trying to track them most</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.269" end="00:43:24.130" style="s2">right now and I think it&#39;s essential for</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.699" end="00:43:26.740" style="s2">our collective future and one and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.130" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">least developed is</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.740" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">the culture that we began mapping and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:33.070" style="s2">stealing fire but is clearly showing up</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:35.410" style="s2">in a lot of different ways around the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.070" end="00:43:38.290" style="s2">world and in the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.410" end="00:43:41.640" style="s2">is a part of it yeah which is what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.290" end="00:43:45.310" style="s2">the emergence of transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.640" end="00:43:47.830" style="s2">collective emergent culture so</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.310" end="00:43:51.790" style="s2">specifically what happens when we get</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.830" end="00:43:53.560" style="s2">together and basically connect in serial</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.790" end="00:43:56.260" style="s2">almost like a bunch of computers to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.560" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">create a collective supercomputer that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.260" end="00:44:00.910" style="s2">is non hierarchical there&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:03.160" style="s2">person at the top of that pyramid and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.910" end="00:44:04.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not flattening that&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.160" end="00:44:06.280" style="s2">we&#39;re all gonna get an endless process</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.690" end="00:44:08.849" style="s2">and share our feelings this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.280" end="00:44:11.230" style="s2">subordination it is a high-functioning</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.849" end="00:44:12.580" style="s2">collaborative process so what does</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.230" end="00:44:14.310" style="s2">basically what do basically ethical</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.580" end="00:44:16.869" style="s2">cults look like you know if you had</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.310" end="00:44:18.250" style="s2">traditional cults were you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.869" end="00:44:19.780" style="s2">loose Tinian mysteries of the Dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.250" end="00:44:21.839" style="s2">cult or anything like that through</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.780" end="00:44:24.849" style="s2">history just from an anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.839" end="00:44:26.740" style="s2">perspective that was subjugation of self</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.849" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">to the lineage which of the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.740" end="00:44:31.480" style="s2">and then we ended up with culty cults</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:33.250" style="s2">you know which was Charles Manson and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.480" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">Jim Jones and potentially Andrew Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.250" end="00:44:36.760" style="s2">and some and audio and some of these</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:39.460" style="s2">others and that was subjugation of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.760" end="00:44:40.780" style="s2">self to the Guru who was a ronin they</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.460" end="00:44:42.730" style="s2">were they were not they were not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.780" end="00:44:44.859" style="s2">samurai with the dojo they just taken</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.730" end="00:44:48.040" style="s2">their own claim and said I am God</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.859" end="00:44:49.630" style="s2">realized and that was obviously wildly</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.040" end="00:44:51.820" style="s2">problematic but we sort of Rini to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.630" end="00:44:53.800" style="s2">reclaim the original intentions cultist</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.820" end="00:44:56.500" style="s2">from latin just means to worship and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.800" end="00:44:59.980" style="s2">what happens when we get together and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.500" end="00:45:01.510" style="s2">worship or experience ecstasy speak</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.980" end="00:45:04.540" style="s2">experiences together how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.510" end="00:45:07.480" style="s2">ethical cults where the individual is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.540" end="00:45:09.780" style="s2">not subsumed but actually the serenity</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.480" end="00:45:12.760" style="s2">of every individual is paramount and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.780" end="00:45:16.300" style="s2">then we collect in we connect in</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.760" end="00:45:19.869" style="s2">co-creative emergence that is a son of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.300" end="00:45:21.910" style="s2">bitch and I haven&#39;t seen anybody outside</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.869" end="00:45:23.950" style="s2">of you know a week or two building a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.910" end="00:45:26.260" style="s2">camp at Burning Man or you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.950" end="00:45:27.609" style="s2">high-performing sports teams or special</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.260" end="00:45:29.380" style="s2">operations I mean they think the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.609" end="00:45:32.890" style="s2">places I&#39;ve seen it have been in</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.380" end="00:45:35.109" style="s2">temporary or explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.890" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">performance-driven meaning they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.109" end="00:45:38.380" style="s2">high-performing teams professional</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:40.220" style="s2">basketball or hockey or suddenly that or</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.380" end="00:45:42.470" style="s2">special operations and if you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.220" end="00:45:44.390" style="s2">cut it in that game of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.470" end="00:45:46.579" style="s2">subordination you&#39;re out and the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.390" end="00:45:49.700" style="s2">person who can has put in place and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.579" end="00:45:52.220" style="s2">to do this in egalitarian non</p>
