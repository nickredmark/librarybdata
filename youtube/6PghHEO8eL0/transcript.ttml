<p begin="00:00:00.080" end="00:00:04.880" style="s2">my concern uh wanting to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.360" end="00:00:07.680" style="s2">something which is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:08.720" style="s2">more long-term strategy was that game a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:11.920" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.720" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">simply our genetic code our uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.920" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">tribal nature manifesting itself and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">that moving from that to</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:20.640" style="s2">anything which isn&#39;t that would be such</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:22.720" style="s2">a monumental task that it would require</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.640" end="00:00:24.640" style="s2">us to go through a new evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.720" end="00:00:25.760" style="s2">yep yeah fortunately this evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.640" end="00:00:29.279" style="s2">actually happened about</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.760" end="00:00:30.880" style="s2">150 000 to 1.5 million years ago okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">this is really good news because if that</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.880" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">hadn&#39;t happened i agree with you that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:35.360" style="s2">the likelihood that we&#39;d be able to sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.360" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">undergo an evolution of that magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">in real time with</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:41.920" style="s2">the hitting the fan is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">zero um</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.920" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">so this is what i mean when i say that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">human beings are not the same as other</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">primates</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.680" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">meaningfully like significantly</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:56.079" style="s2">something happened and we&#39;re obviously</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">witnessing the consequences of that but</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.079" end="00:00:58.000" style="s2">we can actually identify it now and dial</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">it back</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">in so the story kind of goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll try to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">compact because we don&#39;t have infinite</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">time um</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">if you take a look at other primates</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">close promising orangutans</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">guerrillas chimpanzees et cetera what</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">you notice in humans</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">and in fact in this case all social</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">mammals you notice that they all have</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">access to a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">hierarchical structure particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:26.720" style="s2">among males</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">we can call it dominance hierarchy this</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.720" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">phrase has gotten a lot of traction over</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">the past year because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">uh the other jordan um</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s commonplace and we have that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">so you might say</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">our natural need to compete with each</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">for a certain kind of scarcity and to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">organize ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:49.040" style="s2">effective competing bands is real that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">a real part of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.040" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">but human beings also have and is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">thing that actually makes us human</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:56.320" style="s2">and not other kinds of primates a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.320" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">way of doing things it&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">prestige</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">hierarchy which is odd because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">really a hierarchy but it&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">prestige dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got the dominance dynamic which</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">is a hierarchy and the prestige dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">other primates don&#39;t have the prestige</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">this is a incomprehensibly fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s worth sort of actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">slowing down</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">chimpanzees do not do a very good job of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">learning from each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">if a particular chimpanzee has</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">discovered something neato</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t spread through the through</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">the band or the troop</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">this is because dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">are premised on mostly physical violence</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">so a dominant male</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:43.840" style="s2">is able to beat the crap out of other</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">males and therefore establish himself as</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.840" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">dominant</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">and he may have a small number of beta</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">buddies who kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">get the table scraps and to support him</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">but the big thing there is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">the males relate to each other is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">largely</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">aversion meaning you don&#39;t make eye</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">contact with the dominant male because</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">that means it&#39;s a threat he&#39;s gonna kick</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">your ass</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">what&#39;s really hard to learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">things from other people if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">make eye contact with them</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">right yep human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">found themselves over what appears to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">have been a pretty darn long</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">exploration in evolutionary space</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">finding a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">to take advantage of the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">so to interject there some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">listeners that are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">previous episodes will know william von</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">hippel who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">the social leap it was an explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">how we went from uh australopithecus</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">uh out onto the plains the development</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">of the throwing arm and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">all of this sort of stuff and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">big um uh discoveries or one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">claims that he made was that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">anticipation of felt needs and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">unwanted needs was a real a real key</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">element here so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">chimpanzee creates a tool let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">simple tool for</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">poking at something creating some food</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.000" style="s2">whatever it might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">at the end of the day it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.000" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">anticipate the fact that it needs it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">again so it just throws it away</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">and then the next day it comes back it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">got to make the tool again</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">yep however what the uh one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">the main archaeological finds which</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">identified this movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">towards being able to anticipate unfelt</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">was that multiple tools were being found</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">in sites where human ancestors had been</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">so what that meant was that not only had</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">they made them once and then thrown them</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">away they&#39;d made them and then taken</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">them with them the next day</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">so yeah that anticipation and also you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">know communication if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">communicate</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">and especially if you can&#39;t make eye</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">contact but even if you you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">got no sophisticated language at all</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">you&#39;re totally right how does the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">collective consciousness grow it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">it does it so there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">large number like 17 maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">distinct innovations that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">have you ever seen there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">japanese puzzle that has a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">different pieces where</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">you have to be able to actually be able</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">to twist pull</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">and and slide all at once in a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">smooth relationship to get it to move</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">is this like the just the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">hardest rubik&#39;s cube kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">kind of and the note the thing is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">interesting is that if you pull</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">it it binds on the twist if you if you</p>
