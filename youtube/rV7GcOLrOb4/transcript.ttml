<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:08.489" style="s2">sitting in my subconscious cuz it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.869" end="00:02:11.879" style="s2">I&#39;m putting into my conscious so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.489" end="00:02:13.720" style="s2">it&#39;s very much there also I highly</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.879" end="00:02:15.730" style="s2">suggest watching Waco because</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.720" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">I thought I was like this is my John rah</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:21.820" style="s2">I like call stuff I like um like how</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:23.830" style="s2">other people watch stuff on mass burgers</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.820" end="00:02:25.750" style="s2">I that&#39;s not really something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.830" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">interests me but but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.750" end="00:02:30.850" style="s2">about a cult that really does from like</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:32.410" style="s2">how does this happen how do people have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.850" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">their life over to someone else I kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.410" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">of grew up in a cult that wasn&#39;t known</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">as a good my parents got married in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:44.320" style="s2">cult I don&#39;t think it was called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:46.690" style="s2">children of God 90 percent sir but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.320" end="00:02:48.310" style="s2">would sound something very similar what</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.690" end="00:02:50.950" style="s2">the ass company makes up what was that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.310" end="00:02:53.890" style="s2">called CEOs are married in my parents</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.950" end="00:02:55.780" style="s2">weren&#39;t allowed to date they basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.890" end="00:02:59.530" style="s2">were like in order to date they</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.780" end="00:03:00.760" style="s2">basically had to get married and so like</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.530" end="00:03:02.350" style="s2">the first time they kissed was when they</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.760" end="00:03:04.330" style="s2">were engaged or I don&#39;t even know but</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.350" end="00:03:08.170" style="s2">they got married had three kids divorced</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.330" end="00:03:10.120" style="s2">when I was like 13 12 13 so didn&#39;t last</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.170" end="00:03:12.070" style="s2">level hundreds of marriages but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.120" end="00:03:13.810" style="s2">were also is it&#39;s weird to think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.070" end="00:03:15.580" style="s2">because if somebody if some elder of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.810" end="00:03:16.990" style="s2">church had matched them together I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.580" end="00:03:19.690" style="s2">my brother and sister wouldn&#39;t be here</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.990" end="00:03:22.030" style="s2">and we all very much feel like we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.690" end="00:03:23.590" style="s2">supposed to be here and yet our parents</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.030" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">coming together is so antithetical</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.590" end="00:03:28.540" style="s2">because of just who they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">today&#39;s topic is everyone is doing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.540" end="00:03:33.610" style="s2">best they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:35.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it true I don&#39;t know but it is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.610" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">much more compassionate lens to view the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.530" end="00:03:41.410" style="s2">world from it was something that Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:43.140" style="s2">Brown said one of her interviews was</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.410" end="00:03:45.549" style="s2">something along the lines of if you knew</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.140" end="00:03:47.410" style="s2">they were doing the best job they could</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.549" end="00:03:48.700" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t do anything better than</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.410" end="00:03:50.760" style="s2">what they&#39;re currently doing would that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.700" end="00:03:54.190" style="s2">change your viewpoint of them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.760" end="00:03:57.610" style="s2">basically no matter what the situation</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.190" end="00:03:59.440" style="s2">or the person yes it changes my</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.610" end="00:04:01.239" style="s2">viewpoint of them if I think Trump is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.440" end="00:04:03.310" style="s2">doing the best job he could possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.239" end="00:04:04.690" style="s2">doing I&#39;m gonna have more compassion it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.310" end="00:04:08.019" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually change the job he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.690" end="00:04:11.940" style="s2">doing right it doesn&#39;t change that when</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.019" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">is the actual metric but it changes my</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.940" end="00:04:16.060" style="s2">assumption that he&#39;s a bad person right</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:18.010" style="s2">that he&#39;s he&#39;s he could be doing better</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.060" end="00:04:20.650" style="s2">and he&#39;s not I could be doing this job</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.010" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">better and I could do the job of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.650" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">presidency better but</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.100" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t change that he&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.480" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">best drama he can I have this revelation</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">and as most of my revelations I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:33.190" style="s2">cult leader I&#39;m not like and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">from on high and this is now the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.190" end="00:04:37.090" style="s2">proclamation to everybody else it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know if I feel I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:40.660" style="s2">don&#39;t really fully believe it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:42.250" style="s2">but it&#39;s a lens of which to view the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.660" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">world that makes my worldview better and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.250" end="00:04:48.340" style="s2">it&#39;s that when you see somebody else in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.680" style="s2">their life would I do it like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.340" end="00:04:51.430" style="s2">yes yes you would because they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">and you&#39;re them</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.430" end="00:04:59.860" style="s2">we are the incarnation of the same soul</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">7.5 billion times and way more than that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.860" end="00:05:06.190" style="s2">actually because every every soul every</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:10.300" style="s2">point in history is you and me so not</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.190" end="00:05:13.030" style="s2">only would you like we are all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.300" end="00:05:16.060" style="s2">good and all the bad we are part Luther</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.030" end="00:05:20.440" style="s2">King we are Hitler we are and Frank</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.060" end="00:05:23.230" style="s2">we are genghis khan we are all of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.440" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">because that is what our humanity has</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.230" end="00:05:28.690" style="s2">produced that each so I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:30.520" style="s2">think what I would I do if I was in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.690" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">shoes what I act in the same way because</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.520" end="00:05:35.710" style="s2">I know you&#39;re me and your shoes on me</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:40.330" style="s2">I&#39;m you in your shoes and it happens to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.710" end="00:05:42.580" style="s2">be luck it&#39;s like the wrong word but if</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.330" end="00:05:45.460" style="s2">you consider winning the lottery that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.580" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">you have those six numbers usually the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.460" end="00:05:50.590" style="s2">649 at least you Canada you have to pick</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:52.630" style="s2">six numbers out of 49 numbers and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.590" end="00:05:53.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound quite so hard when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.630" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">look at the actual probability of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.950" end="00:05:57.610" style="s2">it&#39;s one in like 10 million or 100</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:06:00.460" style="s2">million the chances of you winning that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.610" end="00:06:02.470" style="s2">if you have five out of the six numbers</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.460" end="00:06:03.790" style="s2">you can win we less money but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.470" end="00:06:06.580" style="s2">the six out of the six numbers that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.790" end="00:06:08.730" style="s2">gives you them the big jackpot and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.580" end="00:06:10.750" style="s2">is basically what it is to be a human</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.730" end="00:06:13.210" style="s2">except instead of there being six</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.750" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">numbers there are thousands of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.210" end="00:06:18.730" style="s2">and it just so happens we&#39;re where are</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:21.190" style="s2">you on that trait what where does your</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.730" end="00:06:23.020" style="s2">slider land and so I&#39;m actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.190" end="00:06:25.570" style="s2">share a screen here because I wanted I</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.020" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">in my mind this is always there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.570" end="00:06:29.620" style="s2">other people who see a graph and turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:34.330" style="s2">off I tried to find the least graph like</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.620" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">graph I could find but this the is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.330" end="00:06:39.009" style="s2">the normal distribution it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:41.740" style="s2">sure it happens with nearly any</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.009" end="00:06:43.960" style="s2">continuous trait that we can measure so</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.740" end="00:06:45.669" style="s2">not something like a light switch being</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.960" end="00:06:47.560" style="s2">on or off because that would be a binary</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.669" end="00:06:50.199" style="s2">it&#39;s either on or it&#39;s off but something</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.560" end="00:06:52.120" style="s2">like height where you can be anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.199" end="00:06:56.500" style="s2">from you know like two and a half feet</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.120" end="00:06:59.139" style="s2">tall to seven feet tall and mostly like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.500" end="00:07:01.780" style="s2">the people who are at their height at</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.139" end="00:07:05.259" style="s2">their full grown height really short</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.780" end="00:07:07.870" style="s2">would be along this this spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.259" end="00:07:09.699" style="s2">those that are really really tall would</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.870" end="00:07:11.620" style="s2">be along here right people that are over</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.699" end="00:07:13.479" style="s2">seven feet tall at their highest point</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.620" end="00:07:15.219" style="s2">but most of us are in the middle at like</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.479" end="00:07:17.439" style="s2">five five and a half feet right five</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.219" end="00:07:20.680" style="s2">almost five to five and three-quarters</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.439" end="00:07:23.379" style="s2">feet weight follows a similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.680" end="00:07:24.969" style="s2">distribution grades follow a similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.379" end="00:07:27.580" style="s2">distribution sometimes because we make</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.969" end="00:07:29.860" style="s2">them look like this we give this as a C</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.580" end="00:07:31.810" style="s2">we let some people get the a or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.860" end="00:07:33.789" style="s2">hundred-percent some people have to fail</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.810" end="00:07:38.409" style="s2">but generally speaking if you give</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.789" end="00:07:40.150" style="s2">people a hundred question test and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.409" end="00:07:41.800" style="s2">general information in a population</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.150" end="00:07:45.400" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find a score like this and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.800" end="00:07:47.500" style="s2">so not only does this is all of traits</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.400" end="00:07:49.650" style="s2">that we can visualize and measure fall</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.500" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">along this this distribution my</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.650" end="00:07:55.270" style="s2">well-informed hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:07:56.979" style="s2">everything falls along nearly everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.270" end="00:07:59.379" style="s2">that could be a continuous trait falls</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.979" end="00:08:01.000" style="s2">along the same distribution and I should</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.379" end="00:08:04.990" style="s2">have had another one open but this thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.000" end="00:08:08.469" style="s2">can be shrunken and higher or or pulled</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.990" end="00:08:11.500" style="s2">out further but this this bell to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.469" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">curve exists in nearly every trait so</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.500" end="00:08:16.810" style="s2">not like our intelligence overall falls</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:19.449" style="s2">along this but our intelligence is also</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.810" end="00:08:21.339" style="s2">itself many different traits so our</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.449" end="00:08:24.520" style="s2">physical intelligence falls along here</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.339" end="00:08:26.409" style="s2">and where you fall is the lottery it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.520" end="00:08:28.150" style="s2">the luck of the draw it&#39;s your genes</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.409" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s your circumstance it&#39;s your skills</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.150" end="00:08:35.349" style="s2">and so saying with any particular skill</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:38.529" style="s2">that we are only what is acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.349" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">right is this the acceptable line and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.529" end="00:08:43.329" style="s2">everyone on this side is a criminal or</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:45.130" style="s2">dysfunctional or disabled and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.329" end="00:08:47.050" style="s2">on this side is okay well what if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.130" end="00:08:49.949" style="s2">like one take over this way or one take</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.050" end="00:08:51.370" style="s2">over that way sometimes the allowable</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.949" end="00:08:53.830" style="s2">spectrum is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.370" end="00:08:55.300" style="s2">is in between so you have to be between</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.830" end="00:08:56.590" style="s2">this height and this height for society</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.300" end="00:08:58.390" style="s2">to work for you if you&#39;re smaller than</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.590" end="00:08:59.110" style="s2">that then things aren&#39;t going to work</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.390" end="00:09:00.220" style="s2">for you if you&#39;re taller than that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.110" end="00:09:06.010" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna hit your head on everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.220" end="00:09:08.440" style="s2">so a point of the normal distribution is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:11.100" style="s2">that although we absolutely look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.440" end="00:09:13.450" style="s2">people who are tall and give them more</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.100" end="00:09:16.090" style="s2">so many studies are on someone&#39;s taller</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.450" end="00:09:17.560" style="s2">they get more leadership roles they get</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.090" end="00:09:19.390" style="s2">promotions more even though they had</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.560" end="00:09:21.370" style="s2">nothing to do with right we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.390" end="00:09:23.230" style="s2">someone is a better person logically</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.370" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">because they&#39;re tall but subconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.230" end="00:09:27.340" style="s2">we do so consciously we give them more</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:29.410" style="s2">power and so if we do that with traits</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.340" end="00:09:32.020" style="s2">that we actually can see everywhere in</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.410" end="00:09:33.280" style="s2">the population right height weight what</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.020" end="00:09:36.130" style="s2">do we do with traits that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.280" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">can&#39;t measure and can&#39;t see right things</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.130" end="00:09:39.430" style="s2">like the intelligence well you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:42.520" style="s2">know what your IQ is but a human is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.430" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">very small bandwidth of intelligence it</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.520" end="00:09:47.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t measure the whole thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:50.380" style="s2">for me looking at this is bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.230" end="00:09:52.120" style="s2">there&#39;s four points really for every</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.380" end="00:09:57.010" style="s2">trait but like it&#39;s so if this is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.120" end="00:10:00.070" style="s2">is let&#39;s say my ability to speak Spanish</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.010" end="00:10:01.810" style="s2">and I&#39;m somewhere down here</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.070" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">I&#39;m not quite I can speak some words in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.810" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">it but I&#39;m not I&#39;m definitely not fluent</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m down here I don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:13.810" style="s2">where I am on this spectrum right I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:15.610" style="s2">only assume is where do I assume</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.810" end="00:10:17.740" style="s2">everybody else is to know where I&#39;m put</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.610" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">there&#39;s this this line is everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.740" end="00:10:24.220" style="s2">the population it is an actual curve but</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:26.170" style="s2">I do but because we can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.220" end="00:10:27.850" style="s2">measure it we don&#39;t actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.170" end="00:10:30.550" style="s2">picture of that curve so I have to guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.850" end="00:10:32.860" style="s2">where I am so in any trait</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.550" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">there&#39;s where there&#39;s the actual trait</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.860" end="00:10:39.870" style="s2">the actual curve and where you actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:44.890" style="s2">are but although it exists it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.870" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">actually so I know point we actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.890" end="00:10:48.040" style="s2">gonna measure the spanish-speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:10:49.540" style="s2">ability of everyone and get this curve</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.040" end="00:10:52.570" style="s2">and know what my spanish-speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.540" end="00:10:55.270" style="s2">ability is to put me on it but how I</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.570" end="00:10:57.940" style="s2">interact in the world is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.270" end="00:10:59.350" style="s2">based on where I think I form on here</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.940" end="00:11:00.910" style="s2">right if I think I&#39;m really low in my</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.350" end="00:11:02.410" style="s2">spanish-speaking and there comes a point</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.910" end="00:11:04.140" style="s2">speak Spanish I&#39;m gonna look for anybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.410" end="00:11:06.060" style="s2">else who&#39;s higher up than me too</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.140" end="00:11:07.860" style="s2">speak it but if I think on the way up</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.060" end="00:11:09.660" style="s2">here even though I&#39;m actually down here</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.860" end="00:11:11.310" style="s2">then when somebody comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.660" end="00:11:12.060" style="s2">speaks Spanish like oh I can translate</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.310" end="00:11:13.860" style="s2">don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.060" end="00:11:17.640" style="s2">super fancy toid you no wait that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.860" end="00:11:19.740" style="s2">German um still German habla</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.640" end="00:11:21.750" style="s2">espanol there we go see look I&#39;m fluent</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.740" end="00:11:24.470" style="s2">but I&#39;m not and this it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.750" end="00:11:27.300" style="s2">change where I fall on this it&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.470" end="00:11:30.150" style="s2">assumption of where I fall on that so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.300" end="00:11:31.770" style="s2">all have where we actually fall on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.150" end="00:11:32.910" style="s2">graph where we think we fall on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.770" end="00:11:34.650" style="s2">graph and there&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.910" end="00:11:36.660" style="s2">overestimate it and people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.650" end="00:11:38.850" style="s2">underestimate it then there&#39;s also our</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.660" end="00:11:42.180" style="s2">everybody else thinks you are and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.850" end="00:11:44.580" style="s2">also can be over underestimated that um</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.180" end="00:11:46.770" style="s2">Trump thinks he&#39;s here on basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.580" end="00:11:48.630" style="s2">every trade when he seems to be lower</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.770" end="00:11:50.850" style="s2">than average on a lot of them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.630" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">again my assumption on him but one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.850" end="00:11:56.300" style="s2">the other traits that that this thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:59.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t deal with generally in math but</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.300" end="00:12:05.010" style="s2">is I assume its own trait is your</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.490" end="00:12:07.230" style="s2">ability to move along a trait so I land</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.010" end="00:12:08.490" style="s2">somewhere on here with Spanish right I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.230" end="00:12:10.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know where I land because we</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.490" end="00:12:13.410" style="s2">haven&#39;t measured the entire population</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.050" end="00:12:18.030" style="s2">but assuming I exist somewhere around</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.410" end="00:12:21.930" style="s2">here and I put in three hours of work a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.030" end="00:12:24.300" style="s2">day at my Spanish I and I move along</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.930" end="00:12:26.760" style="s2">this curve so now I&#39;m here I improved</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.300" end="00:12:28.770" style="s2">but somebody else could have put in an</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.760" end="00:12:30.150" style="s2">hour a day starting from that same point</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.770" end="00:12:31.710" style="s2">and be way over here someone else could</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.150" end="00:12:34.440" style="s2">put in five hours a day and be Vince</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.710" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">less along it so your ability to move</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.440" end="00:12:40.080" style="s2">along and improve on a trait is its own</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:42.630" style="s2">trait so some people put in very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.080" end="00:12:43.950" style="s2">little time and get to improve really</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.630" end="00:12:46.080" style="s2">really well at it some people could put</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.950" end="00:12:47.130" style="s2">in nearly infinite time on there need a</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.820" end="00:13:17.220" style="s2">depending on the train</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.660" end="00:13:21.990" style="s2">or sometimes both ends of that spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.220" end="00:13:26.270" style="s2">and we have a very narrow view on what</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.610" end="00:13:50.100" style="s2">are losing most of human capacity</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.470" end="00:14:29.670" style="s2">traits that were low at not even knowing</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.670" end="00:14:33.750" style="s2">own spectrum so we can put all of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:36.780" style="s2">time and effort into trying to improve</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.750" end="00:14:38.820" style="s2">this trait that we are sorely lacking in</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.420" end="00:15:43.500" style="s2">trades because part of it is that when</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.220" end="00:15:48.060" style="s2">you&#39;re an underestimate er and I am an</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.060" end="00:15:50.850" style="s2">supposed to be an underestimate er right</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.620" end="00:15:52.830" style="s2">so an underestimate er is somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.850" end="00:15:54.089" style="s2">thinks they&#39;re lower on nearly every</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.830" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">trait than they actually are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.089" end="00:15:57.240" style="s2">other people who are over estimators I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:15:58.920" style="s2">would definitely put Donald Trump in</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:00.450" style="s2">that category and he thinks he&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.450" end="00:16:03.330" style="s2">right America kind of falls in that</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.250" end="00:16:12.750" style="s2">measure it and see and it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.589" end="00:16:15.450" style="s2">over/under estimator it&#39;s that society</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.750" end="00:16:17.790" style="s2">props up the over estimators right we</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.450" end="00:16:20.610" style="s2">give people political positions of power</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.790" end="00:16:21.779" style="s2">we make people CEOs when they say</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.779" end="00:16:27.240" style="s2">that confidence to say I&#39;m awesome at</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.089" end="00:16:30.510" style="s2">this then when we compare under</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.240" end="00:16:32.310" style="s2">estimators to them it&#39;s like we assume</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.510" end="00:16:34.680" style="s2">everybody&#39;s an over estimator so</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.310" end="00:16:38.100" style="s2">everybody has to have 10 percentage</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.680" end="00:16:40.290" style="s2">points out off of them when in actuality</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.100" end="00:16:41.970" style="s2">the under estimator is the stuff added</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.290" end="00:16:45.450" style="s2">to there&#39;s the over estimators needs</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.970" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">stuff subtracted from theirs because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.450" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">the solution to me being an</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:51.390" style="s2">underestimate err in society is to just</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:54.180" style="s2">stop being right well stop under</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.440" end="00:17:03.150" style="s2">accordingly isn&#39;t really his solution</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.170" end="00:17:04.860" style="s2">because one we can&#39;t do that and - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.150" end="00:17:06.810" style="s2">really hard metric to measure especially</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.860" end="00:17:10.500" style="s2">like even for height and weight that we</p>

<p begin="00:17:10.500" end="00:17:13.290" style="s2">more than weight because we have a lot</p>

<p begin="00:17:13.290" end="00:17:16.949" style="s2">like this is acceptable and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.790" end="00:17:18.390" style="s2">acceptable we have that around height -</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.949" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">but we also understand that nobody</p>

<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:27.300" style="s2">have you&#39;re not morally lacking because</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.110" end="00:17:34.590" style="s2">that logically that doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.370" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">we still treat them that way well what</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.590" end="00:17:38.340" style="s2">about all the traits that we think like</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.340" end="00:17:42.900" style="s2">control over well there&#39;s still that</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:58.770" style="s2">to this and in actuality what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.610" end="00:20:00.150" style="s2">do as a society is realize on every</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.770" end="00:20:02.160" style="s2">single trait this is this is our</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.150" end="00:20:04.410" style="s2">diversity this is who we are as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.160" end="00:20:06.540" style="s2">species and so we need a world that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.410" end="00:20:09.030" style="s2">works for this not a world that works</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.540" end="00:20:11.400" style="s2">for this tiny little group of people we</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.030" end="00:20:13.290" style="s2">need a world that works for the vast</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.400" end="00:20:14.730" style="s2">majority of us and maybe we never get</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.290" end="00:20:16.470" style="s2">the full tales in there because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.730" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a hard thing to do right make a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.470" end="00:20:21.560" style="s2">world that works for everyone from 2</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:24.390" style="s2">feet tall to 7 and a half feet tall</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.560" end="00:20:26.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot that&#39;s a heart that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.390" end="00:20:27.660" style="s2">word but we could make a world that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.040" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2">works everyone from 3 feet six and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.660" end="00:20:31.560" style="s2">half feet tall right that includes 95%</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.790" end="00:20:33.720" style="s2">of us that includes the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.560" end="00:20:35.460" style="s2">us we have to start somewhere so</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.720" end="00:20:37.560" style="s2">creating a world that works for 1% of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.460" end="00:20:39.090" style="s2">people not great creating a world that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.560" end="00:20:46.190" style="s2">works for more and more of us the better</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.090" end="00:20:48.510" style="s2">and so when for me anyway owning that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.190" end="00:20:50.430" style="s2">one I can&#39;t even know where I fit along</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.510" end="00:20:52.140" style="s2">that I know I&#39;m an under once a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.430" end="00:20:55.220" style="s2">underachiever I&#39;m an underestimate err</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.140" end="00:21:00.660" style="s2">so I think that wherever I am on that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.220" end="00:21:03.450" style="s2">that unless I&#39;m in the 1% even sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.660" end="00:21:05.430" style="s2">then I feel like I&#39;m in the like bottom</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.450" end="00:21:07.710" style="s2">percentage right so even though I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.430" end="00:21:11.430" style="s2">that soft truth I know that in almost</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.710" end="00:21:14.460" style="s2">every treat I am average or better where</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.430" end="00:21:19.470" style="s2">on average I feel low and when I&#39;m high</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.460" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">I feel average so society&#39;s remedy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.470" end="00:21:23.430" style="s2">that is to just not right well don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:26.430" style="s2">underestimate yourself project an air of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.430" end="00:21:28.350" style="s2">confidence unlike my lack of confidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.430" end="00:21:35.250" style="s2">though isn&#39;t my lacking confidence of</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.250" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">in society that I&#39;ve been under it an</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.660" end="00:21:40.530" style="s2">underestimate er and not an overestimate</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.580" end="00:21:42.120" style="s2">er the cost to society that I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.530" end="00:21:44.940" style="s2">underestimate or overestimate er is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.120" end="00:21:46.380" style="s2">societal cost that we only prop up over</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.940" end="00:21:48.360" style="s2">estimators and our vendor estimators and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.380" end="00:21:50.550" style="s2">we&#39;re losing everything that under</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.360" end="00:21:53.070" style="s2">estimators have to give because we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.550" end="00:21:55.710" style="s2">a lot to give because we underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.070" end="00:21:58.440" style="s2">I because I underestimate myself I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.710" end="00:22:00.900" style="s2">that I push even harder because I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.440" end="00:22:02.460" style="s2">that I&#39;m low so I&#39;m pushing so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.900" end="00:22:03.150" style="s2">be average when I was always over</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.150" end="00:22:11.690" style="s2">but that push that drive is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.770" end="00:22:11.690" style="s2">makes me who I have it&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.820" end="00:22:18.540" style="s2">it&#39;s the reason I have what I&#39;m here to</p>

<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:37.380" style="s2">whereas if the same exact distribution</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.910" end="00:22:53.070" style="s2">apart even more and so the over/under</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.790" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">estimator portion of our population we</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.070" end="00:22:57.210" style="s2">need both but what we don&#39;t need in</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.710" style="s2">society well we need actual metrics I</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.210" end="00:23:00.300" style="s2">need to know can you actually do this</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.710" end="00:23:03.870" style="s2">task where do you fit on the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.300" end="00:23:05.940" style="s2">how good are you actually at math not</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.100" end="00:23:13.710" style="s2">fit along the spectrum and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.570" end="00:23:15.720" style="s2">measure that because then I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.710" end="00:23:17.850" style="s2">getting the best person at math and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.110" end="00:23:24.690" style="s2">accordingly it&#39;s and and why why am I do</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.690" end="00:23:27.630" style="s2">because you&#39;re good at math or good at</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.160" end="00:23:36.380" style="s2">but we don&#39;t look at those people having</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.290" end="00:23:41.310" style="s2">earned it in the same way we look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.380" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">over estimators win in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.310" end="00:23:47.010" style="s2">i&#39;m--you&#39;re estimators lose in the world</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.010" end="00:23:50.780" style="s2">underestimate er I have more to give to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.750" end="00:23:53.490" style="s2">this world than over estimators because</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.780" end="00:23:55.140" style="s2">like I can see in my life where because</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.420" end="00:24:05.250" style="s2">since my daughter was born but we were</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.760" end="00:24:07.380" style="s2">better friends before and he&#39;s a he&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.380" end="00:24:11.730" style="s2">when I cooked for him one time I like</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.960" end="00:24:13.170" style="s2">made this like five course meal I went</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.730" end="00:24:15.929" style="s2">over the top I already know how much</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.170" end="00:24:16.380" style="s2">money I spent on the ingredients but if</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.380" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">underestimated my cooking skills I</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:24.450" style="s2">and that happens time and time again</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.780" end="00:24:26.669" style="s2">when I have to make a party when I</p>

<p begin="00:24:33.150" end="00:24:36.299" style="s2">right it&#39;s not the best it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.260" end="00:25:05.789" style="s2">and it&#39;s like society validates us right</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.990" end="00:25:07.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like well what is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.789" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">the remedy as you&#39;re supposed to not be</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.450" end="00:29:39.159" style="s2">becomes okay but if you only have if</p>

<p begin="00:40:31.930" end="00:40:35.860" style="s2">with over and under estimators that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.790" end="00:40:37.600" style="s2">not really true over estimators almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.860" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">always feel like they&#39;re the winner or</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.600" end="00:40:41.080" style="s2">are these project that they feel like</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.910" end="00:40:47.110" style="s2">like right and be like why we gave 60</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.250" end="00:40:50.050" style="s2">percent it&#39;s like actually do you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.110" end="00:40:51.580" style="s2">if we gave a 60 percent no you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.050" end="00:40:53.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know that because how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.580" end="00:40:56.710" style="s2">that it was your 60 or your hundred I</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.310" end="00:40:59.470" style="s2">stopped the thing my anyway my upstairs</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.710" end="00:41:01.150" style="s2">neighbor has this Bell and every month I</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.470" end="00:41:04.360" style="s2">have to take a find it and take a photo</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.150" end="00:41:06.820" style="s2">of it she&#39;s like understandably with her</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.360" end="00:41:08.860" style="s2">her understanding of the world he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.820" end="00:41:11.890" style="s2">well you could just put it in the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.860" end="00:41:13.210" style="s2">place every time and take a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.890" end="00:41:16.360" style="s2">it or take a picture of it right away</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.210" end="00:41:18.700" style="s2">then you have it really good solutions</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.360" end="00:41:21.850" style="s2">right both of those things are an actual</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.700" end="00:41:25.270" style="s2">solution but in order for me to actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.850" end="00:41:26.530" style="s2">do that I have like where and the rest</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.270" end="00:41:28.930" style="s2">of my life is gonna fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.530" end="00:41:31.150" style="s2">right if I everytime I get the bill that</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.930" end="00:41:32.980" style="s2">is my highest priority for her so that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.150" end="00:41:34.780" style="s2">don&#39;t have to look about and she is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.980" end="00:41:36.700" style="s2">ready for her the second she asks for it</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.780" end="00:41:40.270" style="s2">then the rest of my house is gonna fall</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.700" end="00:41:41.650" style="s2">apart and so when so it&#39;s like right you</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.270" end="00:41:43.840" style="s2">might have a solution for this little</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.650" end="00:41:47.170" style="s2">thing but the rest of its gonna fall</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.840" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">apart and so I could eat perfectly I</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.170" end="00:41:52.120" style="s2">could eat a really amazing diet but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:55.750" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna be able to do the rest I</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.120" end="00:41:57.490" style="s2">could you know be a probably I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.750" end="00:41:59.560" style="s2">even be a Pinterest parent but I could</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.490" end="00:42:02.080" style="s2">spend more time with my kid more you</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.560" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">know like I could up that but then it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.080" end="00:42:05.069" style="s2">would cost everything else and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.799" style="s2">so it&#39;s like finding the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.069" end="00:42:10.920" style="s2">diminishing returns I&#39;m doing the best I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.799" end="00:42:12.569" style="s2">can overall and yes every area of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.920" end="00:42:16.079" style="s2">life could be improved but it would cost</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.569" end="00:42:18.900" style="s2">the rest and finding that space of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.079" end="00:42:21.479" style="s2">okay I have this capacity in the day</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.900" end="00:42:26.239" style="s2">what is my highest ability to give from</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.479" end="00:42:30.390" style="s2">that space it&#39;s very different then what</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.239" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">is the most profitable what will society</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.390" end="00:42:39.329" style="s2">give me the most benefit for or I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:40.769" style="s2">anything external there&#39;s the internal</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.329" end="00:42:44.400" style="s2">reward versus the external ward</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.769" end="00:42:47.339" style="s2">no one&#39;s going to give you a sponsorship</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.400" end="00:42:49.589" style="s2">ad because you&#39;re the best you at skiing</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.339" end="00:42:52.200" style="s2">right you have to be the gold medal</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.589" end="00:42:53.970" style="s2">athlete to get the sponsorship ad but to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.200" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">just know you gave your best and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.970" end="00:42:58.729" style="s2">at your peak is a different internal</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:01.559" style="s2">reward and everyone can have that right</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.729" end="00:43:03.479" style="s2">there&#39;s no shortage to the number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.559" end="00:43:05.460" style="s2">people who can be the best they can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.479" end="00:43:08.759" style="s2">at skiing or the best they can be at</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.460" end="00:43:11.099" style="s2">math or history but we have diversity</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.759" end="00:43:13.469" style="s2">because not everyone is interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.099" end="00:43:16.469" style="s2">skiing everyone&#39;s interested in that and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.469" end="00:43:18.479" style="s2">so it&#39;s a combination of where are you</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.469" end="00:43:21.089" style="s2">on that trait are you interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.479" end="00:43:24.299" style="s2">improving it you don&#39;t have to improve</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.190" end="00:43:41.219" style="s2">minimize the external need to learn it</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.349" end="00:43:47.069" style="s2">trait is it because you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.509" end="00:43:49.499" style="s2">that knowledge or is it because you</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.380" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like not even the trying it&#39;s them</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.300" end="00:51:23.750" style="s2">for me anyway it&#39;s the accepting because</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:25.520" style="s2">in my 20s and my teens it was like there</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.750" end="00:51:28.369" style="s2">was this perfect ideal I was supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.520" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">be right up steep perfectly exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.369" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">get in the perfect body whatever that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:36.849" style="s2">and that I could like learn everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:39.500" style="s2">and I&#39;d there was areas I was good at</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.849" end="00:51:41.030" style="s2">naturally science and math and there</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.500" end="00:51:44.450" style="s2">were areas I was not great at geography</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.030" end="00:51:46.040" style="s2">history names and I would try to cram in</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.450" end="00:51:47.420" style="s2">the stuff that I wasn&#39;t good at and a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.040" end="00:51:48.200" style="s2">lot of the stuff that naturally happened</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.420" end="00:51:50.330" style="s2">and then the stuff that naturally</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.200" end="00:51:52.550" style="s2">happened fell away a bit because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.330" end="00:51:55.400" style="s2">wasn&#39;t able to do it in the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.550" end="00:51:57.290" style="s2">I was not in any way a pible of cramming</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.400" end="00:51:59.090" style="s2">and information I didn&#39;t have before</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.290" end="00:52:00.920" style="s2">before I could learn geography in</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.090" end="00:52:03.740" style="s2">history and names if I needed to I could</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.920" end="00:52:05.990" style="s2">like force it into my brain whereas now</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.740" end="00:52:09.589" style="s2">I find I can only just allow I can only</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.990" end="00:52:11.510" style="s2">just allow what comes to come and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.589" end="00:52:14.330" style="s2">because of brain damage just because of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.510" end="00:52:16.940" style="s2">neurological changes I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.330" end="00:52:18.560" style="s2">want to heal that I&#39;m supposed to need</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.940" end="00:52:20.060" style="s2">it to be different and I spent so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.560" end="00:52:21.950" style="s2">of my time needing it to be different</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.060" end="00:52:24.260" style="s2">and try like what went wrong how do I</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.950" end="00:52:27.170" style="s2">get back to where it was how do I fix</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.260" end="00:52:28.820" style="s2">this that I wasn&#39;t seeing what wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.170" end="00:52:31.580" style="s2">accepting what was and once I&#39;m now able</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.820" end="00:52:34.250" style="s2">to accept what is most of the time again</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.580" end="00:52:36.380" style="s2">not perfect magic happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.250" end="00:52:38.450" style="s2">like it&#39;s like even my brain not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.380" end="00:52:40.280" style="s2">words and I can&#39;t pull them out it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.450" end="00:52:42.470" style="s2">frustrating when I allow it to just be</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.280" end="00:52:44.420" style="s2">and my brain works around it I</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.470" end="00:52:45.950" style="s2">communicate well enough when I need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.420" end="00:52:48.500" style="s2">take out that word it&#39;s been everything</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.950" end="00:52:50.690" style="s2">falls apart and I&#39;m not great at</p>

<p begin="00:53:50.210" end="00:53:53.780" style="s2">that will like put two words together</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.560" end="00:53:55.130" style="s2">I&#39;m like that&#39;s not the right word but I</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.550" end="00:54:25.250" style="s2">because it&#39;s what I remember but I also</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.120" end="00:54:26.930" style="s2">can see how far a cup like it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.250" end="00:54:28.520" style="s2">because I can watch old videos I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.930" end="00:54:31.430" style="s2">watch things and be like oh it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.520" end="00:54:34.040" style="s2">different than how it was before but if</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.430" end="00:54:36.050" style="s2">I remember that then it wouldn&#39;t be how</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.040" end="00:54:40.040" style="s2">it was it wouldn&#39;t be what it is like</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.040" end="00:54:43.790" style="s2">skills as much as sometimes I get really</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.320" end="00:54:45.320" style="s2">frustrated with them and I want them to</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.790" end="00:54:47.090" style="s2">be better I want to be at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.320" end="00:54:49.250" style="s2">end of the spectrum like if only I could</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.090" end="00:54:50.630" style="s2">communicate then we&#39;d all live a better</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.250" end="00:54:52.010" style="s2">world because I know how to create a</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.630" end="00:54:54.470" style="s2">world that works for everyone if only I</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.010" end="00:54:56.780" style="s2">was able to communicate it I get into</p>

<p begin="00:54:56.780" end="00:55:00.770" style="s2">it&#39;s like but from that state I&#39;m not in</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.730" end="00:55:02.540" style="s2">my genius and people to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.770" end="00:55:03.830" style="s2">to communicate better in fact my</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.540" end="00:55:05.990" style="s2">communication falls apart even more</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.830" end="00:55:08.540" style="s2">whereas when I&#39;m like this is where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.990" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">are you&#39;re not supposed to be this piece</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.540" end="00:55:14.060" style="s2">other people will come and be this piece</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:17.570" style="s2">or you will naturally be it eventually</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.060" end="00:55:19.160" style="s2">for CNET is never the way and yet other</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.570" end="00:55:21.290" style="s2">people foreseen is exactly what they</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.750" end="00:55:26.920" style="s2">and talents and things from trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.030" end="00:55:28.810" style="s2">really hard and pushing through it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.920" end="00:55:30.099" style="s2">like if you have fear to speak on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.810" end="00:55:31.510" style="s2">stage and then you go and speak on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.099" end="00:55:33.070" style="s2">stage right you&#39;re staying your heart</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.510" end="00:55:36.670" style="s2">out and it feels really good and like I</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.070" end="00:55:38.140" style="s2">want to do that again that&#39;s the key and</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.140" end="00:55:43.000" style="s2">want to do it again or afterwards so you</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.970" end="00:55:45.400" style="s2">like never again right I bungee jumped</p>

<p begin="01:03:46.050" end="01:03:50.040" style="s2">purpose and then what do I need we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.850" end="01:03:52.230" style="s2">common needs but we were all so diverse</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.040" end="01:03:54.390" style="s2">in them right we all need food what food</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.230" end="01:03:56.730" style="s2">we need is different and in that</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.390" end="01:03:59.070" style="s2">diversity gives us the ability to feed</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.730" end="01:04:00.360" style="s2">everybody if we all need in rice all day</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.070" end="01:04:02.640" style="s2">every day and be hard to make enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.360" end="01:04:04.680" style="s2">rice on this planet if we all needed</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.640" end="01:04:06.210" style="s2">corn but because we have a different</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.680" end="01:04:08.430" style="s2">amount of needs for those things we</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.210" end="01:04:10.260" style="s2">actually can produce enough food that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.430" end="01:04:14.450" style="s2">nutritionally adequate</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.260" end="01:04:16.369" style="s2">I mean nutritionally amazing</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.450" end="01:04:18.470" style="s2">and delicious and there&#39;s enough for</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.369" end="01:04:20.720" style="s2">everyone because of our diversity in</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.470" end="01:04:23.000" style="s2">both the land they can grow it not</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.720" end="01:04:25.640" style="s2">everywhere can grow rice but everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.000" end="01:04:27.619" style="s2">can grow something not everywhere and</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.640" end="01:04:29.060" style="s2">this is like why diversity is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.619" end="01:04:33.140" style="s2">solution and then the fifth question</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.060" end="01:04:35.000" style="s2">that was that we added last week is what</p>
