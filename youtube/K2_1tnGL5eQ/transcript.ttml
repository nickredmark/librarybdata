<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:55.260" style="s2">that we could discuss I&#39;d like to first</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:57.809" style="s2">start talking a little bit about your</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.260" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">childhood because you had a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">interesting educational path isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">right or a different I did have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">different educational path different and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">interesting yeah both yeah tell me a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">little bit about it and inserted how you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">solved the education system yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.250" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">didn&#39;t know much about the education</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">system because I wasn&#39;t exposed to there</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">was a I was home taught growing up and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:23.490" style="s2">went to public school for a very brief</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">period a few times as an experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.490" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">few different private schools but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:31.259" style="s2">vast majority of my childhood education</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:33.079" style="s2">homeschooled and the reason was my</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.259" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">parents were kind of educational</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.079" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">philosophers and were interested to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">what would happen at the kid didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:41.400" style="s2">any fixed curriculum and was just</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">exposed to all the things they could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.400" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">exposed to and then their interests were</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">facilitated so it was a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">constructivist idea so that was it I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a certain amount of social</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">studies and geography and math and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:56.810" style="s2">handwriting in English I it really was</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">just a facilitation of questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.810" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">fascination and interest so the few</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">times that I did go to school there were</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">obviously gaps in knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">everyone else was learning like I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">never shown much interest growing up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">American history and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">states and capitals that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">they were areas where I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">setting things that were well outside of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:19.140" style="s2">the scope of anything that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">normally be touched in school and so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.140" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t translate very well</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:26.670" style="s2">what was of course wonderful about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:29.100" style="s2">was I got to not only go very deep in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.670" end="00:02:31.560" style="s2">the areas that I had a main interest but</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.100" end="00:02:34.770" style="s2">my actual interest in life itself was</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.560" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">fostered by having the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.770" end="00:02:38.070" style="s2">topics supported and not being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">be focused on stuff that was of interest</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.070" end="00:02:42.630" style="s2">yes it sounds like you were a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.610" style="s2">curious person and you got a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.630" end="00:02:47.520" style="s2">actually run with that as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.610" end="00:02:50.030" style="s2">being held back by that BA the term</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.520" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">curious person and child are synonymous</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.030" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">you do see individual differences though</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:03:01.800" style="s2">in curiosity and maybe that is partly</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:03.390" style="s2">environmental supportive and as well as</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:05.610" style="s2">I think genetics do play a role you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.390" end="00:03:07.320" style="s2">in terms of dopamine production and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.610" end="00:03:09.330" style="s2">their genes that code for dopamine but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.320" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a good point in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.330" end="00:03:12.990" style="s2">of ways from evolution perspective you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:14.730" style="s2">need curiosity right you need or to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.990" end="00:03:16.230" style="s2">adapt I mean if you but child who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.730" end="00:03:18.630" style="s2">gonna explore their environments at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:20.610" style="s2">you know the child will not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.630" end="00:03:24.510" style="s2">adapt at all what do you study in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.610" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">college I studied the math physics</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.510" end="00:03:29.460" style="s2">philosophy and undergrad psychology more</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:33.390" style="s2">philosophy in graduate school but then</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.460" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">getting into ecology biology medicine</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.390" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">complex systems most of that wasn&#39;t in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">formal academic situation it was in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:42.150" style="s2">independent studies and research</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:44.610" style="s2">environments for instance medicine was</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.150" end="00:03:46.290" style="s2">working with some different diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.610" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">laboratories working with medical</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.290" end="00:03:51.090" style="s2">doctors and clinics on complex cases and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:52.440" style="s2">working to try and find insights that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.090" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">were outside of the scope of what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.440" end="00:03:56.780" style="s2">currently had insights on well what was</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:04:00.660" style="s2">the college you went to undergrad was</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.780" end="00:04:03.450" style="s2">Mauri University in what our University</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.660" end="00:04:05.850" style="s2">worth it looking it&#39;s in Iowa Fairfield</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.450" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">Iowa it was a very kind of unique school</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.850" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">that was focused on studying the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">sciences with a deeper thought process</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:16.080" style="s2">around subject/object relationship cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:17.520" style="s2">so when did you start to think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.080" end="00:04:18.770" style="s2">putting together this neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.520" end="00:04:21.000" style="s2">collective how did that come about</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.770" end="00:04:22.770" style="s2">now hacker is a relatively recent</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">project we started it about three years</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.770" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">ago and I have gotten into integrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:29.229" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:31.389" style="s2">and kind of diagnostic medicine</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.229" end="00:04:33.729" style="s2">therapeutic medicine especially for</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.389" end="00:04:35.169" style="s2">cases that both allopathic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.729" end="00:04:37.599" style="s2">integrative medicine didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.169" end="00:04:40.419" style="s2">adequate solutions yet partially because</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.599" end="00:04:41.830" style="s2">of my own diagnosed illnesses that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.419" end="00:04:43.479" style="s2">didn&#39;t have adequate solutions that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.830" end="00:04:45.159" style="s2">had to work on and some of which had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.479" end="00:04:47.889" style="s2">neurodegenerative component so I got</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.159" end="00:04:50.379" style="s2">deep into understanding how neurological</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.889" end="00:04:52.120" style="s2">systems work how dysfunction worse and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.379" end="00:04:54.069" style="s2">because there weren&#39;t any adequate</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.120" end="00:04:56.469" style="s2">solutions offered anywhere of course the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.069" end="00:04:58.449" style="s2">only like meaningful option was see if</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.469" end="00:05:00.099" style="s2">novel insights can be generated by</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.449" end="00:05:02.919" style="s2">approaching it differently and so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.099" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">started applying cybernetic theory how</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.919" end="00:05:07.029" style="s2">do the bottom-up and top-down regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">systems in the human organism work and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.029" end="00:05:12.580" style="s2">whole systems and complexity theory how</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:14.319" style="s2">do all of the different comics and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.580" end="00:05:17.050" style="s2">the different body systems interact and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.319" end="00:05:19.629" style="s2">have cascade effects and etc and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">ended up leading to a set of hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.629" end="00:05:25.000" style="s2">about how health works how aging works</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:27.159" style="s2">and how illness works and then how</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.000" end="00:05:29.050" style="s2">illness in a case like mine could have</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.159" end="00:05:31.150" style="s2">worked led to me being able to do some</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.050" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">kind of unique research Diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.150" end="00:05:35.469" style="s2">find things out that traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:37.330" style="s2">medicine had not that led to me actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.469" end="00:05:39.009" style="s2">being able to treat and reverse the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.330" end="00:05:40.719" style="s2">conditions I had that were you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.009" end="00:05:42.310" style="s2">reverse autoimmune antibodies reversed</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.719" end="00:05:44.229" style="s2">things that are not usually medically</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.310" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">thought of as reversible which led to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.229" end="00:05:47.710" style="s2">then doing that with a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:50.589" style="s2">people who had you know working with</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.710" end="00:05:52.779" style="s2">various integrative doctors who had also</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.589" end="00:05:55.449" style="s2">what are traditionally beamed as</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.779" end="00:05:57.909" style="s2">uncurable cases and getting to see that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.449" end="00:06:00.430" style="s2">we could reliably reversed some kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.909" end="00:06:02.349" style="s2">pathology and then this was very</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.430" end="00:06:04.899" style="s2">meaningful and that we could address not</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.349" end="00:06:06.729" style="s2">only physical pathology but meaningfully</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.990" end="00:13:38.540" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming decentralized existential</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.000" end="00:13:40.580" style="s2">tech so we will either have the negative</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.580" end="00:13:45.830" style="s2">self-destruct us where we will emerge</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.500" end="00:13:47.089" style="s2">into fundamentally net positive traits</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.830" end="00:13:48.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s the only way to make it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.089" end="00:13:50.839" style="s2">through so this is cool</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.920" end="00:13:53.210" style="s2">so we do have existential tech and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.839" end="00:13:54.350" style="s2">you&#39;re in a lot of ways developing the</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.350" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">what&#39;s the opposite of existential tech</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.630" end="00:14:01.460" style="s2">technology that enhances us in a way</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.660" end="00:15:42.020" style="s2">people take this for you as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.250" end="00:15:43.940" style="s2">a lot of Buddhists</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:19.130" style="s2">breaking for some time and last election</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.790" end="00:16:21.740" style="s2">we got to see the Republican Party not</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">the beauty of what happened was what</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.740" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">only a few people were really acutely</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.389" end="00:23:22.090" style="s2">sure no tropic as a term it was defined</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.990" end="00:23:24.850" style="s2">with the development of molecule called</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.500" end="00:23:57.190" style="s2">beyond baseline means not just taking</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.750" end="00:26:13.370" style="s2">started you know was studied in the</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.340" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">we have different kinds of performative</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.529" end="00:26:51.539" style="s2">know sell a drug so for enhancement</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.820" end="00:27:00.220" style="s2">sell it as a drug and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.519" end="00:27:02.759" style="s2">set of like our whole process of studies</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.220" end="00:27:06.039" style="s2">factors what we call risk benefit ratio</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.759" end="00:27:08.440" style="s2">where you&#39;re willing to have some risk</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.039" end="00:27:09.940" style="s2">and study because there is a disease</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.440" end="00:27:12.610" style="s2">that if you don&#39;t treat there&#39;s risk of</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.610" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">benefit ratio for enhancement it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.529" end="00:27:18.309" style="s2">totally new topic but it&#39;s a topic</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.309" end="00:27:20.529" style="s2">transhumanism right now brain chip</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.529" end="00:27:25.509" style="s2">implants you know gene therapy etc and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.470" end="00:27:28.299" style="s2">nootropics are one of those fields so</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.509" end="00:27:29.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of quantified self data</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.299" end="00:27:31.870" style="s2">and have like the early people in</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.740" end="00:27:33.220" style="s2">steroids who made a lot of mistakes but</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.870" end="00:27:34.659" style="s2">then actually learned a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.220" end="00:27:36.490" style="s2">endocrinology that the endocrinologist</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.659" end="00:27:38.590" style="s2">couldn&#39;t learn that had advanced the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.490" end="00:27:41.710" style="s2">field of endocrinology and now made you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.590" end="00:27:43.960" style="s2">know we have Psalms today that have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.710" end="00:27:45.519" style="s2">same positive effect with a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.960" end="00:27:47.740" style="s2">fraction of the negative effects of the</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.740" end="00:27:50.830" style="s2">through that kind of citizen science</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.269" end="00:27:52.659" style="s2">testing of course at the cost of some of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.830" end="00:27:55.179" style="s2">the people the tropics has had a similar</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.659" end="00:27:57.730" style="s2">curve and so we have data but the data</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.179" end="00:27:59.169" style="s2">is not as deep long-term and robust as</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.730" end="00:28:01.299" style="s2">we would like it to be and it will be</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.169" end="00:28:03.669" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been reading a lot of blogs</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.299" end="00:28:05.799" style="s2">from people who have been treating</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.669" end="00:28:07.299" style="s2">themselves human guinea pigs and trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.799" end="00:28:08.980" style="s2">lots of things I have to say I have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.299" end="00:28:10.419" style="s2">thank you for introducing me to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.980" end="00:28:12.519" style="s2">whole idea of nootropics it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.419" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">fascinating world and it really has</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.519" end="00:28:17.230" style="s2">inspired me I would say to to really</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:19.299" style="s2">understand what you know there clearly</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.230" end="00:28:21.940" style="s2">are some nootropics that are more well</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.299" end="00:28:23.799" style="s2">studied than others that&#39;s for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.940" end="00:28:25.210" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they&#39;re all in an equal</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.799" end="00:28:27.070" style="s2">footing I don&#39;t think you would say they</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.210" end="00:28:30.309" style="s2">are at all now you created something</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.070" end="00:28:32.379" style="s2">called qualia right this was very well</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.309" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">researched so you put together 40</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.379" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">ingredients is that right that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:37.690" style="s2">synergistic with each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:40.659" style="s2">yeah the current version of auliah has</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.690" end="00:28:42.509" style="s2">42 ingredients but we have many many</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.659" end="00:28:44.909" style="s2">many different iterations and versions</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.509" end="00:28:47.559" style="s2">so what&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.909" end="00:28:49.450" style="s2">nootropics and what are called smart</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.559" end="00:28:52.210" style="s2">drugs the difference we nootropics and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.450" end="00:28:54.850" style="s2">SSRIs for instance where are the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.210" end="00:28:56.590" style="s2">difference between those so just to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.850" end="00:28:57.550" style="s2">explicit about something that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.590" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">obvious so</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.550" end="00:29:00.850" style="s2">medical disclaimer part nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:02.530" style="s2">we&#39;re sharing here is medical advice I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.450" end="00:30:53.560" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.550" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">positive application of them but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.560" end="00:30:56.560" style="s2">recommend people be highly educated</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:30:58.330" style="s2">before exploring and then explore</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.560" end="00:31:00.580" style="s2">conservatively I appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.330" end="00:31:02.500" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to understand is how is</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.580" end="00:31:04.840" style="s2">the difference but to like your qualia</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.500" end="00:31:07.210" style="s2">nootropics in general they do affect and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.840" end="00:31:08.710" style="s2">they do target neurotransmitters they do</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.210" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">target like dopamine production</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.710" end="00:31:11.510" style="s2">serotonin production that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:13.910" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.510" end="00:31:16.580" style="s2">with target serotonin production how is</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.910" end="00:31:18.920" style="s2">that different so let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.580" end="00:31:21.680" style="s2">dopamine princess sono favorite it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.920" end="00:31:24.710" style="s2">favorite molecule yeah it is a favorite</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.680" end="00:31:26.870" style="s2">for everybody the dopamine opioid axis</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.710" end="00:31:28.910" style="s2">right the kind of pain pleasure reward</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.870" end="00:31:31.820" style="s2">circuit axis is one of the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.910" end="00:31:34.280" style="s2">evolutionary biology axes in nervous</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.820" end="00:31:38.540" style="s2">systems for knowing what to avoid and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.280" end="00:31:41.150" style="s2">what to go towards and so major aspects</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.540" end="00:31:44.870" style="s2">of how pain pleasure dynamics work etc</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.150" end="00:31:46.910" style="s2">are their most OCB addiction is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.870" end="00:31:49.190" style="s2">dysregulation of that system it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.910" end="00:31:51.020" style="s2">profoundly deep system even if someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.190" end="00:31:54.170" style="s2">also has serotonin or bottle or other</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.020" end="00:31:55.790" style="s2">things to address so dopamine is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.170" end="00:31:57.800" style="s2">first of the catecholamines so it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.790" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">converts to northen Efrain and then to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.800" end="00:32:01.460" style="s2">epinephrine and those are all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">stimulatory neurotransmitters dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.460" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">has a lot to do with focused attention</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:09.740" style="s2">concentration also pattern analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">pattern recognition pattern isset ii</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.740" end="00:32:13.250" style="s2">it&#39;s why if it&#39;s excessive you can get</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:17.090" style="s2">full pattern recognition single to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.250" end="00:32:19.310" style="s2">schizophrenia oh yeah yeah and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.090" end="00:32:22.070" style="s2">deficient you&#39;ll have lack of Drive lack</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.310" end="00:32:24.350" style="s2">of motivation as well as inability to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.070" end="00:32:26.750" style="s2">recognize patterns adequately so under</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.350" end="00:32:29.140" style="s2">performance it&#39;s not more or less that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.750" end="00:32:31.940" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in it is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.140" end="00:32:34.670" style="s2">adaptiveness right it&#39;s how the dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.940" end="00:32:36.020" style="s2">process can self-regulate well because</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.670" end="00:32:37.430" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to relax and fall</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.020" end="00:32:38.930" style="s2">asleep you don&#39;t want to have dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.430" end="00:32:41.300" style="s2">peaking you want it to be able to chill</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.930" end="00:32:43.070" style="s2">and you&#39;re trying to concentrate you</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.300" end="00:32:45.710" style="s2">want your body to be able to up regulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.070" end="00:32:48.380" style="s2">so one thing is rather than give someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.710" end="00:32:50.330" style="s2">a dopamine agonist that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.380" end="00:32:51.980" style="s2">elevate dopamine kind of no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.330" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">we would like to be able to give</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.980" end="00:32:58.400" style="s2">precursors and then the conversion</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:00.110" style="s2">factors on those precursors and other</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.400" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">things that support your body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.110" end="00:33:06.170" style="s2">dopaminergic processes so that it can do</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:07.940" style="s2">its own basically you think about it has</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.170" end="00:33:10.760" style="s2">the body as an internal and endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.940" end="00:33:12.410" style="s2">regulatory system how do we support that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.760" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">regulatory system to self-regulate</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.410" end="00:33:17.180" style="s2">better so what dopamine dopamine is you</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.220" style="s2">have a essential amino acid</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.180" end="00:33:21.380" style="s2">phenylalanine it gets converted to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.220" end="00:33:23.510" style="s2">tyrosine it gets converted to acetyl</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.380" end="00:33:24.809" style="s2">tyrosine it gets converted to l-dopa it</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.510" end="00:33:26.909" style="s2">gets converted to dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.809" end="00:33:29.129" style="s2">it has to travel a process and apps</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.909" end="00:33:29.730" style="s2">where it&#39;s broken down by chemicals like</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.129" end="00:33:32.100" style="s2">mao-b</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.730" end="00:33:34.049" style="s2">and then it has to get up taken and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.100" end="00:33:36.690" style="s2">postsynaptic dopamine receptors and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.049" end="00:33:38.340" style="s2">there&#39;s differential up taking the d1 d2</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.690" end="00:33:41.549" style="s2">d3 receptors that affect how it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.340" end="00:33:44.220" style="s2">processes and it can also be broken down</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.549" end="00:33:47.129" style="s2">by hydroxylase into norepinephrine etc</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.220" end="00:33:48.870" style="s2">so if someone doesn&#39;t have enough phenyl</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.129" end="00:33:50.490" style="s2">alanine enough tyrosine if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.870" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">have enough of the phosphorylated</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.490" end="00:33:54.749" style="s2">version of b6 that helps convert or</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:57.179" style="s2">vitamin C or copper that helps convert</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.749" end="00:33:59.309" style="s2">the amino acids into l-dopa</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.179" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">and then into dopamine if they&#39;re mao-b</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.309" end="00:34:02.909" style="s2">levels are excessively high or they</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:05.100" style="s2">hydroxide these are all gonna lead to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.909" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">imbalances in their own regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.100" end="00:34:10.919" style="s2">systems so we were looking at common</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:12.270" style="s2">regulatory difficulties and how to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.919" end="00:34:15.240" style="s2">able to support the systems have</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.270" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">increased regulatory robustness and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.240" end="00:34:20.190" style="s2">therefore you&#39;re less likely to see grow</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:22.200" style="s2">side effects yeah right so think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.190" end="00:34:26.069" style="s2">you know when I when I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.200" end="00:34:28.319" style="s2">the amino acids the vitamins and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.069" end="00:34:31.079" style="s2">minerals were necessary as cofactors</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.319" end="00:34:32.609" style="s2">plus the synaptic transmission plus the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.079" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">receptor site modulation we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.609" end="00:34:36.599" style="s2">at multiple steps across a whole pathway</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:39.409" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing where the rate limiting</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.599" end="00:34:42.210" style="s2">effects and how can we support those and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.409" end="00:34:44.849" style="s2">but then that&#39;s just opening right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.210" end="00:34:46.710" style="s2">so increased concentration without</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.849" end="00:34:49.020" style="s2">increased working memory ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.710" end="00:34:50.909" style="s2">pretty lame and so increased working</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.020" end="00:34:53.159" style="s2">memory is mostly not dopamine lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.909" end="00:34:54.810" style="s2">supported right it&#39;s mostly mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.159" end="00:34:57.750" style="s2">acetylcholine and other transmitters</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.810" end="00:34:59.280" style="s2">and the compte yeah well so that now</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.750" end="00:35:01.380" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at enzymes again right</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.280" end="00:35:03.750" style="s2">yeah and so if we&#39;re wanting to increase</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.380" end="00:35:06.300" style="s2">short-term and long-term and working</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.750" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">memory and intensity of focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.300" end="00:35:10.980" style="s2">concentration but also the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:12.599" style="s2">task switching well it was we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.980" end="00:35:13.710" style="s2">modeled from a cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.599" end="00:35:15.930" style="s2">perspective what are all the things</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.710" end="00:35:18.290" style="s2">we&#39;re wanting to affect or what people</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.930" end="00:35:20.220" style="s2">call the synergy of those things are</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.290" end="00:35:23.460" style="s2">cognitively available creative</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.220" end="00:35:25.530" style="s2">productive flow states of that what are</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.460" end="00:35:27.810" style="s2">the underlying physiological pathways</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.530" end="00:35:29.460" style="s2">that mediate those and then how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.810" end="00:35:30.839" style="s2">support those pathways then let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.460" end="00:35:33.569" style="s2">at synergies between them</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.839" end="00:35:35.670" style="s2">sounds like a fair approach well I do</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.569" end="00:35:38.550" style="s2">wonder though okay so in listening to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.670" end="00:35:39.960" style="s2">this could be like well like how</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.550" end="00:35:42.600" style="s2">you why are you why do you have so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.960" end="00:35:44.460" style="s2">confidence you were not formally trained</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.600" end="00:35:46.590" style="s2">you&#39;re not you could imagine a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.460" end="00:35:49.320" style="s2">listening to this and and just</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.590" end="00:35:50.910" style="s2">immediately dismissing this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.320" end="00:35:53.790" style="s2">is saying well look I&#39;m not even gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.910" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">listen to this because he didn&#39;t even go</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.790" end="00:35:57.420" style="s2">through med school what do you say that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">you know so I was like like why are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.420" end="00:36:03.090" style="s2">so confident in what you&#39;re saying well</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:05.900" style="s2">having a lot of respect for what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.090" end="00:36:07.800" style="s2">consider better methods of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.900" end="00:36:10.260" style="s2">interdisciplinary education and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.800" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">traditional specialist education usually</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.260" end="00:36:13.830" style="s2">does we also have a lot of respect for</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.840" style="s2">people that the cutting edge of their</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.830" end="00:36:17.910" style="s2">specialties that formally trained in it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.840" end="00:36:20.280" style="s2">so you know this wasn&#39;t developed in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.910" end="00:36:22.170" style="s2">isolation this development was working</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.280" end="00:36:24.120" style="s2">with many doctors were working and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.170" end="00:36:25.890" style="s2">integrated facilities running pre and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.120" end="00:36:27.420" style="s2">post blood labs and we actually started</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.890" end="00:36:29.150" style="s2">with you know having some medical</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.420" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">directors I want to play with us and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.150" end="00:36:32.250" style="s2">particularly with patients they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.410" style="s2">having a hard time with him he said we</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.250" end="00:36:35.250" style="s2">show again risk-benefit made sense to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.410" end="00:36:37.410" style="s2">them because they were having a hard</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.250" end="00:36:40.380" style="s2">time they said we think we&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.410" end="00:36:42.450" style="s2">approach that could help and so we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.380" end="00:36:44.280" style="s2">customizing chemistry based on looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.450" end="00:36:47.370" style="s2">at their genome their clinical chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.280" end="00:36:49.500" style="s2">their clinical intake etc and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.370" end="00:36:51.090" style="s2">getting to see really profound shift not</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.500" end="00:36:53.490" style="s2">just in subjective reporting but in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.090" end="00:36:55.920" style="s2">those same biometrics being tested again</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.490" end="00:36:57.240" style="s2">and so then that that&#39;s actually where</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">we started in the formulation process</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.240" end="00:37:01.530" style="s2">and then started to say well what things</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:04.110" style="s2">are pretty common across most people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.530" end="00:37:05.790" style="s2">have similar desires or symptom ology</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.110" end="00:37:07.170" style="s2">that we could before getting into</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.790" end="00:37:09.060" style="s2">personalized medicine be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.170" end="00:37:11.880" style="s2">meaningfully affect at scale so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.060" end="00:37:14.220" style="s2">doctors were contributing to the insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.880" end="00:37:16.230" style="s2">of you know how we did formulation and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.220" end="00:37:17.730" style="s2">then we&#39;ve had a number of PhD</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.230" end="00:37:19.230" style="s2">neuroscientists of different disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.730" end="00:37:21.270" style="s2">neural chemists on petition we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.230" end="00:37:23.190" style="s2">scientists etc look at what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.270" end="00:37:24.750" style="s2">give us feedback on at a number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.190" end="00:37:28.530" style="s2">different kinds of doctors psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.750" end="00:37:30.780" style="s2">and integrative MDS and etc look at it</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.530" end="00:37:33.060" style="s2">and give us feedback on it many doctors</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.780" end="00:37:35.250" style="s2">just find what we were doing start using</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.060" end="00:37:37.800" style="s2">it in their clinics and contact us and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.250" end="00:37:39.510" style="s2">saying you know here are the effects</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.800" end="00:37:41.430" style="s2">were seeing in patients they were very</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.510" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">positive so we&#39;re actually just starting</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.430" end="00:37:46.230" style="s2">to put together a program to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">like harvest this that or better how we</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.230" end="00:37:51.990" style="s2">can be distributed science and of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:52.420" style="s2">once we came to a place that we felt</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.990" end="00:37:54.520" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.420" end="00:37:56.770" style="s2">our own internal testing on formulation</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.520" end="00:37:59.830" style="s2">which had many rounds we did a formal</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.770" end="00:38:01.870" style="s2">safety data sheet we had you know which</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.830" end="00:38:03.580" style="s2">looked at all of the research meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.870" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">analysis structured review on all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.580" end="00:38:09.370" style="s2">ingredients and etc and we had</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:13.780" style="s2">pharmacists look at it doctors look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.370" end="00:38:15.310" style="s2">it HD neuro chemists look and I I went</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.780" end="00:38:17.020" style="s2">through you know I don&#39;t take anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.310" end="00:38:19.450" style="s2">at face value right so I mean I looked</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.020" end="00:38:21.550" style="s2">every researched every single one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.450" end="00:38:22.990" style="s2">ingredients and I like spent like a day</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.550" end="00:38:25.980" style="s2">on each one I was like because that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.990" end="00:38:28.570" style="s2">one&#39;s very potent it&#39;s very potent so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.980" end="00:38:30.490" style="s2">racetam starting with piracetam in them</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.570" end="00:38:32.890" style="s2">there&#39;s many other racetam zener asset</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.490" end="00:38:35.110" style="s2">an impressive them do different things</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.890" end="00:38:37.630" style="s2">but their primary effect is up</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.110" end="00:38:40.900" style="s2">regulating acetylcholine uptake in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.630" end="00:38:43.660" style="s2">nmda complex so they&#39;re learning helps</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.900" end="00:38:46.360" style="s2">with learning and memory learning memory</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.660" end="00:38:49.480" style="s2">working memory but also sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.360" end="00:38:51.340" style="s2">nerve capacity and so they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.480" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">allosteric modulator zat the nmda</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.340" end="00:38:56.230" style="s2">complex and then which racetam will have</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:59.830" style="s2">differential effects on gaba receptors</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.230" end="00:39:02.590" style="s2">or dopamine receptors etc so rasa tems</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.830" end="00:39:04.120" style="s2">are really the first kind of major area</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.590" end="00:39:05.530" style="s2">of Metroplex that people get into it</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.120" end="00:39:07.180" style="s2">anyone gets into no tropic and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.530" end="00:39:08.710" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re affecting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.180" end="00:39:10.330" style="s2">postsynaptic neurons uptake of</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.710" end="00:39:12.220" style="s2">acetylcholine then they&#39;ll usually start</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.330" end="00:39:14.890" style="s2">stacking them with some choline donors</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.220" end="00:39:16.630" style="s2">may be some acetyl group donors and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.890" end="00:39:18.790" style="s2">maybe some things to help the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.630" end="00:39:20.920" style="s2">acetylcholine get across the synapse</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.790" end="00:39:22.750" style="s2">like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.920" end="00:39:24.460" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s how you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.750" end="00:39:26.230" style="s2">start to stack the pathway for</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.460" end="00:39:29.500" style="s2">acetylcholine the next major category</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.230" end="00:39:30.910" style="s2">that people really kind of come to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.500" end="00:39:32.500" style="s2">into with no topics that are very</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.910" end="00:39:34.750" style="s2">meaningful are amp Athene&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.500" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">which are glutamate uptake on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.750" end="00:39:39.100" style="s2">postsynaptic neuron so much leaders of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:41.530" style="s2">the AMPA complex and up regulating the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.100" end="00:39:44.940" style="s2">glutamate up taking increases the speed</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.530" end="00:39:48.310" style="s2">of synaptic transmission but also</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.940" end="00:39:49.870" style="s2">decreases excitotoxin from excessive</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.310" end="00:39:53.140" style="s2">levels of glutamate and that staying in</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.870" end="00:39:55.720" style="s2">the synapse so new pet new pet has am</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.140" end="00:39:57.730" style="s2">packing like and racetam like properties</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.720" end="00:39:59.620" style="s2">at the same time meaning that it up</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.730" end="00:40:01.480" style="s2">regulates both due to main and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.620" end="00:40:04.600" style="s2">acetylcholine uptake in the postsynaptic</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.480" end="00:40:06.340" style="s2">neuron which is quite unique aniracetam</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.600" end="00:40:09.700" style="s2">also does both of those but</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.340" end="00:40:10.870" style="s2">does it more potently and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.700" end="00:40:12.220" style="s2">research showing it as being</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.870" end="00:40:14.170" style="s2">neuroprotective because it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.220" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">specifically protecting neurons from</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.170" end="00:40:20.080" style="s2">excitotoxin city damage while typically</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:21.940" style="s2">you could decrease excitotoxicity from</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.080" end="00:40:23.590" style="s2">glutamate by just scavenging glutamate</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.940" end="00:40:25.060" style="s2">and you can use things like oxaloacetate</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.590" end="00:40:27.190" style="s2">to do that but then you&#39;re decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.060" end="00:40:29.230" style="s2">the speed of glutamatergic transmission</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.190" end="00:40:31.210" style="s2">so new pep does this unique thing where</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.230" end="00:40:32.890" style="s2">it decreases excited Lexus city while</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.210" end="00:40:34.660" style="s2">increasing glutamatergic transit</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.890" end="00:40:36.550" style="s2">transmission released support minute</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.660" end="00:40:38.710" style="s2">so new pip is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.550" end="00:40:42.070" style="s2">molecule from the standpoint of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.710" end="00:40:43.980" style="s2">both neuroprotective and increasing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.070" end="00:40:47.320" style="s2">number of interesting dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.980" end="00:40:49.030" style="s2">learning attention and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.320" end="00:40:52.030" style="s2">big kind of holy grails the space is</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.030" end="00:40:54.310" style="s2">working memory yeah I see a big in terms</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.030" end="00:40:56.910" style="s2">of Holy Grail it turns the future of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.310" end="00:41:00.310" style="s2">this is it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.910" end="00:41:02.530" style="s2">personalizing dosage because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.310" end="00:41:04.660" style="s2">individual differences in genetics that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.530" end="00:41:07.300" style="s2">that help regulate neurotransmitter</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.660" end="00:41:09.010" style="s2">production and how in some interactions</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.300" end="00:41:12.370" style="s2">so I&#39;m sure you&#39;re working on that area</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.010" end="00:41:15.160" style="s2">right so we are and you know being able</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.370" end="00:41:16.930" style="s2">to have integrative doctors</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.160" end="00:41:19.240" style="s2">psychiatrists neurologists general</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.930" end="00:41:22.510" style="s2">practitioners get support and better and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.240" end="00:41:24.760" style="s2">better methodologies for assessing brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.510" end="00:41:27.190" style="s2">chemistry and not just brain chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.760" end="00:41:28.570" style="s2">but endocrinology physiologic chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.190" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">etc and then putting all that together</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.570" end="00:41:32.710" style="s2">and then being able to work to balance</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:34.270" style="s2">and optimize it that&#39;s hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.710" end="00:41:36.370" style="s2">and it&#39;s an area that you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.270" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2">working in and working with some small</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.370" end="00:41:39.970" style="s2">number of doctors to kind of prototype</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:41.860" style="s2">methodologies but also working on</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.970" end="00:41:44.080" style="s2">structures that could be brought more</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.860" end="00:41:46.390" style="s2">widely but there&#39;s also things that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.080" end="00:41:49.300" style="s2">that could happen that are not dr.</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.390" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">atheras mediated so imagine a portal</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.300" end="00:41:55.120" style="s2">where someone can take cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:56.920" style="s2">assessments online using best in class</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.120" end="00:41:58.870" style="s2">online cognitive assessment that has</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.920" end="00:42:00.190" style="s2">been correlated to best in class and</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.870" end="00:42:04.090" style="s2">personal assessment and shows high</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.190" end="00:42:07.660" style="s2">accuracy and also online psychometric</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.090" end="00:42:10.390" style="s2">assessments and so that people can see</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.660" end="00:42:13.150" style="s2">how their pattern recognition their work</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.390" end="00:42:15.490" style="s2">memory but also structured subjective</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.150" end="00:42:17.800" style="s2">insights into their you know psychologic</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.490" end="00:42:19.830" style="s2">state predisposition etc and they could</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.800" end="00:42:21.840" style="s2">track that in time then imagine</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.830" end="00:42:24.180" style="s2">they could load up into that same portal</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.840" end="00:42:25.830" style="s2">and somatic portal and they control</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.180" end="00:42:27.810" style="s2">their information so it&#39;s not being used</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.830" end="00:42:30.210" style="s2">by anybody company for reasons they</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.810" end="00:42:31.950" style="s2">don&#39;t want that they could upload their</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.210" end="00:42:33.450" style="s2">motion tracker data their content by</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.950" end="00:42:35.730" style="s2">itself there&#39;s loop tracker data and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.450" end="00:42:36.510" style="s2">then maybe even if they go get medical</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.730" end="00:42:39.000" style="s2">blood data</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.510" end="00:42:40.440" style="s2">qyg data and then the system doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.000" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">just look at each one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.440" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">psychrometric s-- and biometrics on</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:45.810" style="s2">their own in relationship to a reference</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:48.600" style="s2">range but starts looking at what is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.810" end="00:42:50.550" style="s2">whole complex of data with all the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.600" end="00:42:52.410" style="s2">pieces tell us that is synergistically</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.550" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2">more than the separate pieces right you</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.410" end="00:42:55.410" style="s2">could imagine like a Fitbit for this</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:58.530" style="s2">literally tracks this stuff throughout</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.410" end="00:43:00.390" style="s2">the day absolutely so we are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.530" end="00:43:03.570" style="s2">the intersection of quantified self data</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.390" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">harvesting sounder adoptable biometric</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.570" end="00:43:07.830" style="s2">Diagnostics and better psychometric</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:09.570" style="s2">Diagnostics and then the synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.830" end="00:43:12.660" style="s2">all that knowledge to then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.570" end="00:43:14.430" style="s2">customize protocols both at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.660" end="00:43:15.630" style="s2">medical protocols where doctors can use</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.430" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">it and at the level of just</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.630" end="00:43:19.980" style="s2">direct-to-consumer wellness protocols</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:21.630" style="s2">now for that imagine a version of qualia</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.980" end="00:43:23.250" style="s2">that is fully customized where we get to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.630" end="00:43:25.020" style="s2">take all this data from someone and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.250" end="00:43:27.210" style="s2">customized which chemicals and which</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.020" end="00:43:29.370" style="s2">amounts are in there that requires a</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.210" end="00:43:31.110" style="s2">robotic we automated compounding</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.370" end="00:43:33.090" style="s2">pharmacy that can make a custom</p>

<p begin="00:43:33.090" end="00:43:38.190" style="s2">based on an AI generation of their</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.190" end="00:43:43.260" style="s2">biometric data that&#39;s complex to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.400" end="00:43:44.970" style="s2">a dream of ours we want to we want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.260" end="00:43:46.980" style="s2">get there and be able to do it and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.970" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">definitely worked on how to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.980" end="00:43:51.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not right around the corner yet but</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:51.930" style="s2">maybe in our lifetime oh and do much</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.090" end="00:43:53.850" style="s2">sooner than that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.930" end="00:43:56.520" style="s2">are you familiar with note six</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.850" end="00:43:59.340" style="s2">experience machine full of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.520" end="00:44:01.110" style="s2">experiment no you know he has this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.340" end="00:44:03.300" style="s2">thought experiment you know imagine if</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.110" end="00:44:05.820" style="s2">we could hook you up to a machine and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.300" end="00:44:07.560" style="s2">gives you whatever it is desirable or</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.820" end="00:44:09.210" style="s2">pleasurable anytime you want it turns</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.560" end="00:44:11.820" style="s2">out most people would not want that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.210" end="00:44:12.990" style="s2">because they want to the will is</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.820" end="00:44:15.300" style="s2">something about the human will about</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.990" end="00:44:18.920" style="s2">suffering and overcoming suffering that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.300" end="00:44:21.900" style="s2">makes us human that makes us want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.920" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">gives us a sense of meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.900" end="00:44:26.730" style="s2">ultimately the kind of vision you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:28.710" style="s2">for this world at which I share and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.730" end="00:44:32.430" style="s2">and I think is really quite admirable</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.710" end="00:44:33.630" style="s2">we&#39;ll have to go beyond nootropics right</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.430" end="00:44:37.339" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s only part</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.630" end="00:44:39.900" style="s2">the whole system of cultural changes of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.339" end="00:44:41.220" style="s2">personal changes as well that is willed</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.900" end="00:44:44.430" style="s2">right yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.220" end="00:44:46.349" style="s2">so let&#39;s just roughly break down four</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.430" end="00:44:48.390" style="s2">categories that we can look at this in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.349" end="00:44:50.190" style="s2">terms of that are not reducible to each</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.390" end="00:44:51.900" style="s2">other but are all under effect sounds</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.190" end="00:44:55.589" style="s2">good let&#39;s think about human physiology</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.900" end="00:44:57.329" style="s2">which includes our you know EEG pattern</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.589" end="00:44:59.099" style="s2">computational neuroscience stuff our</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.329" end="00:45:01.259" style="s2">neural chemistry or endocrinology the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.099" end="00:45:03.180" style="s2">our microbiome genetic expression just</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.259" end="00:45:04.980" style="s2">all of the things that affect what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.180" end="00:45:07.500" style="s2">can think of as the human Hardware so</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.980" end="00:45:10.410" style="s2">there are human Hardware predispositions</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.500" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">for I mean if you just think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.410" end="00:45:14.940" style="s2">consciousness running on that Hardware</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:16.859" style="s2">then then empathy runs on certain neural</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.940" end="00:45:19.109" style="s2">networks utilize utilizing certain</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.859" end="00:45:21.390" style="s2">neural chemistry etc that can be up or</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.109" end="00:45:24.660" style="s2">down legged it can be down regulated by</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.390" end="00:45:26.970" style="s2">head trauma by microbiome imbalances by</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.660" end="00:45:29.160" style="s2">toxicity can also be operated by a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.970" end="00:45:31.380" style="s2">number of things so let&#39;s think about</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.160" end="00:45:33.690" style="s2">the human Hardware predispositions and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.380" end="00:45:36.930" style="s2">capacities let&#39;s think about human</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.690" end="00:45:39.150" style="s2">software being our value systems or</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.930" end="00:45:41.369" style="s2">world view or understanding themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.150" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">or understanding of other right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.369" end="00:45:45.660" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re not hardware software as</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:47.400" style="s2">totally distinct categories like they</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.660" end="00:45:49.619" style="s2">are in computers because of course they</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.400" end="00:45:52.500" style="s2">are dynamically intersecting each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.619" end="00:45:54.269" style="s2">continuously in real time that&#39;s means</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.500" end="00:45:55.740" style="s2">that the neural plasticity where your</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.269" end="00:45:57.240" style="s2">thoughts are affecting physiology and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.740" end="00:46:00.660" style="s2">your physiologist predisposing thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.240" end="00:46:02.910" style="s2">it is a it is a completely intimate link</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.660" end="00:46:04.799" style="s2">between them but we can so roughly think</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.910" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">of those categories so on the software</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.799" end="00:46:08.250" style="s2">side we have education we have media we</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:11.309" style="s2">have psychology with personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.250" end="00:46:13.410" style="s2">development psychotherapy etc on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.309" end="00:46:14.819" style="s2">hardware side we have not just medicine</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.410" end="00:46:16.740" style="s2">but the future of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.819" end="00:46:18.569" style="s2">optimization and those are both at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.740" end="00:46:20.309" style="s2">level of the individual then at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.569" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">level of beyond the intuitive level of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.309" end="00:46:24.210" style="s2">the collective kind of the hardware of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">the collective is infrastructure how we</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.210" end="00:46:28.049" style="s2">meet our physical needs in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:29.730" style="s2">the planet water energy agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.049" end="00:46:32.279" style="s2">transportation in factoring waste</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.730" end="00:46:34.049" style="s2">management and then the software the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.279" end="00:46:37.289" style="s2">collective is the agreement fields that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.049" end="00:46:38.759" style="s2">run over that is social structures</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.289" end="00:46:42.359" style="s2">economics governance</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.759" end="00:46:44.759" style="s2">language ultimately the hardware and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.359" end="00:46:47.569" style="s2">software of the individual and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.759" end="00:46:49.459" style="s2">collective all have to be upgraded and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.569" end="00:46:52.069" style="s2">for this kind of phase shift that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.459" end="00:46:56.299" style="s2">humanity is entering into and upgraded</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.069" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">towards Omni positivity meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.299" end="00:47:00.199" style="s2">each of those four have things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:02.180" style="s2">affect human experience in human</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.199" end="00:47:03.859" style="s2">behavior the environment right the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.180" end="00:47:04.849" style="s2">lower-right infrastructure that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.859" end="00:47:06.529" style="s2">build world and natural world</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.849" end="00:47:08.420" style="s2">environment affect you can experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.529" end="00:47:10.369" style="s2">and affect your behavior so do the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.420" end="00:47:12.380" style="s2">social agreement fields culture</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.369" end="00:47:14.509" style="s2">economics etcetera economics what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.380" end="00:47:16.940" style="s2">incentivize very directly affection</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.509" end="00:47:19.130" style="s2">behavior what we have status of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.940" end="00:47:21.049" style="s2">allocated to etc our definition of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.130" end="00:47:23.329" style="s2">success in the individual and human</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.049" end="00:47:25.279" style="s2">software and our physiology so we would</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.329" end="00:47:26.930" style="s2">say no topics are just the first part</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.279" end="00:47:30.739" style="s2">we&#39;re getting into of human physiology</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.930" end="00:47:33.289" style="s2">which is just one of these areas and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.739" end="00:47:35.930" style="s2">of them are necessary but only all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.289" end="00:47:38.119" style="s2">them together makes efficient yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.930" end="00:47:40.219" style="s2">appreciate you outlining those for that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.119" end="00:47:42.019" style="s2">topology there are heart there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.219" end="00:47:44.299" style="s2">things we can do software wise that can</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.019" end="00:47:45.890" style="s2">show the same effects on phy ology and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.299" end="00:47:48.440" style="s2">physiology as the nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.890" end="00:47:50.599" style="s2">in some case like meditation can get you</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.440" end="00:47:53.209" style="s2">in a state of mind it&#39;s so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.599" end="00:47:55.130" style="s2">different routes perhaps to this upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.209" end="00:47:56.390" style="s2">there&#39;s not just a single route and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.130" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">there are multiple routes that can get</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.390" end="00:48:00.799" style="s2">you the same place perhaps some time</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:03.019" style="s2">same place and sometimes different but</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.799" end="00:48:05.420" style="s2">related but highly synergistic places</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.019" end="00:48:07.249" style="s2">when they come oh sure yeah for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.420" end="00:48:09.199" style="s2">that&#39;s the beauty of self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.249" end="00:48:10.999" style="s2">systems and I mean that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.199" end="00:48:12.140" style="s2">point of systems right is that you want</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.999" end="00:48:14.569" style="s2">to get to a point where they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.140" end="00:48:16.369" style="s2">integrated and that the entropy is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.569" end="00:48:18.380" style="s2">minimized we were just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.369" end="00:48:21.829" style="s2">whole systems and self-organization yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.380" end="00:48:23.539" style="s2">and by understanding how whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.829" end="00:48:25.549" style="s2">works leads to a perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.539" end="00:48:27.650" style="s2">emphasizes synthesis of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.549" end="00:48:29.329" style="s2">meaningful modalities one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.650" end="00:48:32.449" style="s2">concepts that we have to get over that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.329" end="00:48:34.609" style="s2">is kind of reductionism in the negative</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.449" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">sense rather than positive as the word</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.609" end="00:48:38.269" style="s2">is kind of looking for single bullet</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:39.799" style="s2">silver bullet solutions you know a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.269" end="00:48:41.299" style="s2">single molecule that&#39;s going to fix this</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.799" end="00:48:43.069" style="s2">whole thing well it wasn&#39;t a single</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.299" end="00:48:44.779" style="s2">molecule that was off there was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.069" end="00:48:48.140" style="s2">cascade of systemic effects that were</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.779" end="00:48:49.640" style="s2">off and so is it human hardware or is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.140" end="00:48:52.249" style="s2">human software or is it the environment</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.640" end="00:48:54.229" style="s2">or well it&#39;s usually all items some kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.249" end="00:48:56.539" style="s2">of complex so the question becomes if</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.229" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">someone&#39;s physiology is off how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.539" end="00:49:00.199" style="s2">balance it can lead to their psychology</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:00.780" style="s2">being out of balance which can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.199" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">their physical</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.780" end="00:49:04.410" style="s2">make more at once and you get a vicious</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:06.390" style="s2">cycle you can also get virtuous cycles</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.410" end="00:49:08.310" style="s2">of creating lift and meb areas making it</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.390" end="00:49:10.350" style="s2">easier for better behavior and function</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.310" end="00:49:12.600" style="s2">in those areas creating more lift so our</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.350" end="00:49:14.370" style="s2">interest is how do we stop negative</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.600" end="00:49:16.680" style="s2">feedback cycles and how do we promote</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.370" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">virtuous cycles positive feedback cycles</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.680" end="00:49:21.120" style="s2">between by the mind relationship</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:23.340" style="s2">environment right between all of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.120" end="00:49:26.370" style="s2">intersecting complexes and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.340" end="00:49:28.350" style="s2">meaningfully synthesize and support all</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.370" end="00:49:30.270" style="s2">of the modalities are actually effective</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.350" end="00:49:33.210" style="s2">no that sounds like a great goal I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.270" end="00:49:35.430" style="s2">you have our thoughts you know like</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.210" end="00:49:36.840" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy effects do</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:38.040" style="s2">the way we frame things don&#39;t way we</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.840" end="00:49:40.230" style="s2">make meaning out of our experiences</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.040" end="00:49:42.390" style="s2">effects our cortisol production it</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.230" end="00:49:44.760" style="s2">affects you know our negative reactions</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.390" end="00:49:46.710" style="s2">so we it in all these different they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.760" end="00:49:48.390" style="s2">bi-directional you know yes all these</p>
