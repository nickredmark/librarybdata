<p begin="00:00:24.320" end="00:00:30.080" style="s2">light on a different planet but yeah</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:38.480" style="s2">it&#39;s stuck with me so much you know some</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.559" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">places are really sticky</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.480" end="00:00:42.399" style="s2">other places you kind of forget the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:44.559" style="s2">details and the sort of a distant memory</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.399" end="00:00:46.000" style="s2">there&#39;s something about where we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.559" end="00:00:47.840" style="s2">and i&#39;m i mean particularly</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.000" end="00:00:49.600" style="s2">some milan and and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.840" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">conversations that we had there walking</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.600" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">you know through that ancient olive</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:57.039" style="s2">grove just there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">something about you know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.039" end="00:01:00.640" style="s2">is just absolutely magical</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:02.320" style="s2">and i feel it as i walk around here</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.640" end="00:01:04.400" style="s2">every day this sort of it always enters</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">into my mind at some point in the day</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.400" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">yeah i think we need to be really</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">grateful</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">for living in places that actually have</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">that capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">to sort of pattern us in a healing way</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">that are just so ancient and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:21.439" style="s2">where people have put such care</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">like in crystal waters for example i</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.439" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">it becomes a feedback loop i&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:30.320" style="s2">this at finton where</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">by so many people with real attention to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">detail and place</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">and and respect of place trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">um be good custodians of the land and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">and and bring it to life eventually as</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">the place comes to life</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">i i feel it it actually gives back to us</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">in in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">so many ways and um i</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:55.600" style="s2">i felt that at finton i feel it here in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">in the mountains where people have</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.600" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">over millennia built these terraces and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:01.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">taking care of olives that are sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">nine hundred a thousand years old um</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">very special</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s remarkable isn&#39;t it you feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:12.879" style="s2">that care in that landscape you feel the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">you know the love that must have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.879" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">imbued in in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">creating those amazing places and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:20.319" style="s2">everything&#39;s crafted and handcrafted and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">i&#39;m you know and i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">you know coming back here into crystal</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">waters i was chatting to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">has recently moved here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">was just mentioning about how every day</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:32.080" style="s2">they go for a walk and they just sit</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">beside either one of the lakes or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.080" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">river or</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">walk up to the top of the hill where</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">they&#39;ve got sort of a 360 view around</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">national parks and just say how</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.599" style="s2">absolutely healing the place is and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.599" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">you need to have that reflected back at</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">you i&#39;ve been here for 20 years now and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">i mean i feel that on a daily basis but</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">you do take it for granted when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">just within it and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">maybe you know i really like i really</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">like being able to have that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">that sort of sense of connection and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">sense of healing and sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">specialness um uh reminded</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">given a reminder but i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">particular about the wildlife here that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">brings me to brings me alive every day</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">we&#39;re surrounded by kangaroos and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">wallabies</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">and you know every day i i wake up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">there&#39;s like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">there&#39;s a family that lives here with us</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">in this place i mean we don&#39;t keep them</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">they just come past we</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s kangaroo trails everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">and anyway so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">little family and you get to know each</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">um you know each successive family that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">this mother</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">brings into the into the into the place</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s so nice to watch</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">a you know out the window or even just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">sitting out in the garden with them</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">a little baby joey come out of the pouch</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">for the first time and sort of try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">find its legs and just wobbling all over</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">the place and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">and the sound of the birds and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">there&#39;s that deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">joy in being having a deep relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">with like the more than human</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">and and starting to hear the different</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">sounds and the signals and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">the changes that happen and and start to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">feel that signaling something else and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">it&#39;s only when</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">we sort of slow down enough and spend</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">enough time in place that i think we</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">to reconnect with that and i think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">re-indigenizing process</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i i don&#39;t know necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">how to describe that but i feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">i feel an essence of that when i have</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">well i i wanted to ask you about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">because in many ways you&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">um how long have you been now at crystal</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">waters over 20 years over 20 years now</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">so so you&#39;ve lived over the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">years something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve held as my high vision of what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">wanted to do at some point in my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">um the the whole process of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">really arriving on a piece of land and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">saying um</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">this is where i take my stand this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">this is where i&#39;m going to grow roots</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">and and try to help this place thrive</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.759" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">and build a place where my family and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">community can thrive</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">and um how how has that been for you</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">you&#39;re are you originally from brisbane</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">or you lived in brisbane before you</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">moved i&#39;m originally from melbourne the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">outskirts of melbourne i grew up in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">suburbs</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">of melbourne um but the suburbs were not</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t like a jam-packed suburb it</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">was quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">a sort of a hilly natural landscape i</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">grew up on a quarter acre block which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">quite standard for the outskirts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">melbourne</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">although it was a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">because my mum and dad built our house</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">and so i had this sense of what it meant</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">to live in an owner-built house and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">a house that had passive solar design</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">and being really truly engaged in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.199" style="s2">managing a building to be efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">and knowing where the where those rocks</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.199" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">came from or</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">how that bit of balcony was put together</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">and so i guess that sense and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">my mum was we grew a little bit of food</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">in the backyard but it wasn&#39;t a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:09.520" style="s2">thing although they talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">what my parents were really focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">and it was a big thing in that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">sort of the 70s was um bringing back the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">native</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">uh plants to attract wildlife and create</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">spaces for birds so there was always</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.120" style="s2">of this is a space for nature and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.120" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">protect that and to regenerate nature i</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">kind of grew up within that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">space so</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">i&#39;d often heard about crystal waters i</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">went through landscape architecture</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">environmental planning design urban</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">design kind of school</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">in melbourne and i&#39;d always watched this</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:40.560" style="s2">place that had started to be talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">um in southeast queensland and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">uh so i hadn&#39;t been there until after i</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">went to schumacher college and i was um</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">i worked with helena norberg hodge in</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">ladakh and experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">when was that back in 92</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">yeah so yeah so i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">i&#39;d i learned i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">learning about what it meant to live a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">sustainable life i could</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">say what it was i could write an essay</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:15.199" style="s2">about it i could</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">you know talk about it and then i went</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.199" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">to ladakh</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">and there was this community where that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">was totally embedded in the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">that everything came from the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">went back to the earth and it was this</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">there was a great sense of joy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">you know and there was an enormous sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">of wealth even though there was no money</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">being exchanged and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">and so i came back thinking how do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">leave such a rich</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">place-connected community-connected</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">joyful regenerative life back here in</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s when i re-embraced permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">again because i&#39;d known about it for</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">ages my parents had always talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">as something that was kind of like if if</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">you have any sense about you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">this is what you should be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">you know that was kind of always put in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">that little pigeon hole like</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s who has good common sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:04.800" style="s2">looks at permaculture and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">and there was always the books on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.800" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">shelf you know they always got talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">and um and so i thought okay now&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">time to take that permaculture course</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">and and also to go and visit crystal</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">waters and so i did this</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">two things together and i came here and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">one sorry what was that who was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">teacher on that course was it max or</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">up the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">uh the green harvest the organic</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">seeds placed and also a woman called</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">um her name is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">jill jordan who started up the let</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">uh in australia and also stand up the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">local community cooperative banks and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">the whole cooperative movement in</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">melania</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">and it was that that really inspired me</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">anyway i fell in love with</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">christa waters and i also fell in love</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">with this boat called evan</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">and and um and that was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">basically uh we we both weren&#39;t living</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">at crystal waters at the time he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">living in brisbane</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">so i basically moved up to brisbane</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">and we started the city farm together we</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">our goal was actually to create an eco</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">village in the middle of brisbane</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">and it was just too hard with all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">planning laws and it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">so we thought okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">low-hanging fruit and our the group that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">we were working we thought okay well</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">let&#39;s just start the food bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">the gardens and and then from that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">was the the community that formed around</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">that was extraordinary we created</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">you know organic farmers markets and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">food box systems and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">yoga groups and kids groups and people</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">started to move into the neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">around the city farm and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">by default we were creating this urban</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">eco village</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">even though it wasn&#39;t you know an</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">intentional village that was created</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">and well i know five years into that um</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">we got invited to come up to crystal</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">waters to see if we wanted to take on</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">running the permaculture courses here</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">um because max was pulling back and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:06.079" style="s2">said sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">ecological solutions or something at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.079" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">time</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">back i think because he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">focusing more on the work with jen at</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">that time which was just starting out</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">and uh yeah so we so we stepped in and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">did that and just you know those moments</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">everything just happens at the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">so evan&#39;s mum had just um</p>

<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">he was looking for ethical investments</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">and we said well there&#39;s a block of land</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">that we&#39;d really love to buy</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">so he he basically put up the money for</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">at the half of it that we needed to to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">actually get our own place here and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">we started</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:03.360" style="s2">building over time so yes it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">everything just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">was right for us to move here and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">we&#39;ve never looked back</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">absolutely absolutely love living here</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">raised our family here</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">built a house the only little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">debt that we went into</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">was with my dad just to get the land and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">everything since then</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve done without any debt so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">built our house</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">module by module we started off i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">the office</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">at the moment which started out as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">shed and then it became our house</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">and uh and now it&#39;s my office and so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">have these</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:37.040" style="s2">what i call buildable affordable modules</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.040" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">enable us and so a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">actually come and had a look at this and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">thought well that&#39;s a really good way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">to get started you start with one little</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">core bit and then you just keep adding</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">and adding it as you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">um and it&#39;s it&#39;s been really great and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">just to watch my kids growing up</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the things that that i</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">was reflecting on a lot when i was</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">living in finton</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">um and working with jen in different</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">ways how</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">so many of the model eco villages have</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">built at a time where um planning</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:14.959" style="s2">regulations were different</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">and um where it was somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">easier to like to still encounter a sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">of sandbox where you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">just go ahead and do it and then build a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">relationship with the local planning</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">office and eventually get</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">illegal buildings recertified and and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">and um it there seems to be really a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:38.839" style="s2">if we want more people to engage more in</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.839" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">reinhabitation process and careful</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">stewarding of land</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">to to create new planning regulations</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">that say</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">as long as you have a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">impact on the land</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">and you hit these requirements</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">we will make it easy for you to to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:01.839" style="s2">past the official planning goals because</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">in many ways they&#39;re there to protect</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.839" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">the land from being destroyed um</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:11.360" style="s2">in in some cases not that people with</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">lots of money then somehow always</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.360" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">navigate past those laws</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">but um but i noticed this here in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">majorca for example in the tremontana</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">where we were</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">at sevilla&#39;s place this wonderful place</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">on roland if you try to do anything in</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">sunru land</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:30.450" style="s2">and that would basically use this place</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">for example as a teaching center</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.450" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">just slightly building infrastructure so</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">house people even if you did it in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">most respectful way</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">it would be almost impossible to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">planning permission for anything because</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a unesco world heritage site</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">and so um sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.880" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">the laws that protect the land from</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">infringing of development</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">also impede sort of innovative eco</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">regenerative development um and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right we lived as</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a similar type of thing too with um</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">you know people</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">uh protecting farmland landscapes or</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">protecting</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">uh you know national parks you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">saying okay this is a national park</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">and lock it up and then the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">people can&#39;t live there and create</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">villages there</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">or you know but it the intent is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:24.720" style="s2">protect it but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">destroying it because it is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.720" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">people-managed landscape in and of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">itself or</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">the farm landscapes that as it&#39;s changed</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">from being a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">working farm into sort of more just as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.560" style="s2">a nice looking hillside for</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">the rich people to live up on the hills</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.560" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">there&#39;s you know it&#39;s changed already</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">those things so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">the farmland needs people taking people</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">out of the farmland</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">you know turns it in well here in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">australia it just turns it into these</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">weed infested fields that are have lost</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">their fertility they actually need</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">the ongoing you know management and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">more people in and on those landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">so i&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">as crystal waters land is actually able</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">to be regenerated and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">looking at places like uh wales where</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">they do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">the one planet development where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:16.800" style="s2">government&#39;s actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">okay if if you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:20.320" style="s2">regenerative type of development</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">we can talk about how you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">piece of land and build a community</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:26.240" style="s2">off-grid and do it differently than say</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">what you would down near the town</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.240" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">and so we do need these this flexible</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">way of doing it and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">only seeing a couple of councils that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">are being a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">flexible like this now it goes in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">waves</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">i sort of feel like crystal waters has</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">has a relationship with the council that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">means that it is able to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.519" style="s2">more experimental i mean i still all my</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">buildings are still</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.519" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">um absolutely to the book there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s not approved</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">about what i do with them</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">except we&#39;ve pushed the boundary with</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">things like the toilet system</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">or the wastewater system and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">education around that with the public</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">plumbing department and with</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">you know the the local councillors to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">actually shift</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">the boundary and then we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">ripple out so it&#39;s they&#39;re places of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s when that&#39;s able to happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s great but i know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">lot of limitations in a lot of places</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a classic like those examples</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">like for example the straw bale building</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">at um fintorn uh the large one</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">was really the first in scotland and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">um so the planning department really had</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">use it as a case to learn about straw</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">bale building and whether</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">and how they might make sense scotland</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">or similarly in germany the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">um at um it&#39;s even linden equal village</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:49.199" style="s2">when they started building in multi</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">stories with it like a timber</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.199" end="00:16:52.639" style="s2">timber frame and then straw bale infill</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">they basically wrote the planning rules</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">on how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">build structurally sound multi-storey</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">strawberry buildings</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">um but but what we expect</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">like what we&#39;re experiencing here on</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">majorca at the moment i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">starting to help miguel ramis with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">project of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">trying to get serious about landscape</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">regeneration and experimenting with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.240" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">bioproductivity that we can generate in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">a climate</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">change influenced future so so really</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">looking into</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">the different areas on majorca that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">represent the four growing zones of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">and then um seeing what we can do to to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">build soil to bring back the rain to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">increase um like build microclimates</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:47.600" style="s2">allow for more diverse productivity but</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">even if you try to do stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.600" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">um you run into laws</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">that will stop you or at least delay you</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">sometimes a year and a half two years</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">three years so for example i was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">disappointed when i when i realized that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">just something as simple as digging</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">a natural water reservoir in the center</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">or in</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">in a pro appropriate place on your land</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">where there&#39;s a gully</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">to to collect water runoff and have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">have another safety in in case of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">drought</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">and and bring back the whole micro</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">climate that comes with having a body of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">water and all the animals that that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">live in it and so on</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s impossible like it would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">changing the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">and for that you then have to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">amazing like what tamera did</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">in their land like they have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">climate and we have here</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">um very dry area among</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">a few almond and oak trees and so on</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">and just by building that really large</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">lake they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">completely changed the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">microclimate</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">but to do the same here that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">got 17</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">lakes that are within our landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">australia too</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a very dry landscape and i remember</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">this being really quite stuck when i</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">first came here</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">and seeing the impact of having those 17</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">lakes put in here is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">remarkable but not only that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something um with this new</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">system um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">going now which is called um</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">leaky weirs which is uh it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">united nations</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">recognized system now for rehydrating</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:28.720" style="s2">the landscape so it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">have to be a water body but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.720" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s slowing down the water and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">filling up gullies to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">to back it up and they&#39;re transforming</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">um quite degraded</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">farmlands using this system and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">been going up</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">into the valleys um all around crystal</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">waters and noticing actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">what&#39;s been happening naturally</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we&#39;re starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">that natural regeneration of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">of some rainforest species and and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">whole landscape</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">has changed there it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">remarkable so i&#39;m going to sort of take</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">my camera and my video up there and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">start to document</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">the impact that this is having because</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s replenishing springs</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s bringing back shade it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">helping to restore so when i walk</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">through there</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:10.240" style="s2">now it feels like i&#39;m walking on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">sponge when you go</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.240" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">out a bit further it feels like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">just walking back on hard land</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">there&#39;s something that&#39;s happening there</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">that&#39;s just bringing life back into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">soil</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">and so when i start to think about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">of these limitations and the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">behind these limitations it really does</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">make us think that we need to take that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">whole bi-regional perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">and start to be talking at that meta</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">level you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">the um the road maps with the common</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">earth road maps</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:39.039" style="s2">so these bi-regional areas that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">actually exploring different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.039" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">doing things and looking at it as being</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a global movement with bioregional</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">examples and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">link in with with that to be able to to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">get some</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">local action and local loosening of laws</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">or redesigning laws to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">in support of regeneration instead of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">purely heritage like how can you support</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">heritage and the future</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">at the same time because you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">way things are now i mean i remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">walking through those landscapes as</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">beautiful as they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">there was a sense of that the soil was</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">completely depleted</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">you know if if you to support yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">from those terraces and from those</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">landscapes a completely different way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">managing them would be needed</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s possible to have both and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that be amazing to actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">bring those terraces back to life again</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">you know with an amazing polyculture and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">and a sense of rehydration of those by</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">thinking about you know the whole entire</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:42.159" style="s2">catchments</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s totally possible but it does</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">require a shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">in thinking and a bi-regional approach</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:49.679" style="s2">yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">the thing is on the one hand it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.679" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">you really have to work globally on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">in the sense that</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">um the building of alliances between</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">understanding the importance of working</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">by originally and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the wonderful thing that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">are now lots of different organizations</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:13.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">have um somehow arrived at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.919" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">bioregional scale</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">from different angles so i find it for</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">example really fascinating that the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:24.559" style="s2">planetary health alliance which</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">which to some extent is still somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.559" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">stuffy</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">health policy researchers and academics</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">looking at population health um</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">but the very fact that they&#39;ve put at</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">the center that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">um planetary health and ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">health is fundamental for human and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">population health</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">and that um if we want to decrease</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">national spending on health the best way</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">to do so is to actually help like like</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">improve the local ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s that plays very strongly in</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">our direction and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">and also the fact that they they</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">bioregional health maintaining the</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">is a scale that is is a sensible</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">um but for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">the issue is sometimes that on the one</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:14.640" style="s2">hand you need to bring in that global</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:18.159" style="s2">alliance</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">um in order to then have the critical</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.159" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">master say look this is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">a local group of visionaries saying we</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">need to do this this</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">there are visionaries of this type in</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">every continent of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">planet and very serious well</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">uh like like people with good track</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">records of doing real projects</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">and and they&#39;re all working on this um</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">that then helps to maybe influence</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">planning departments but what the minute</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">you actually go into your</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:46.960" style="s2">place it opens up in the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">as a fractal</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.960" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">of complexities that um</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">like just working with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">structure of land ownership and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">how to build the alliances and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">constantly how to get past regulations</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">both at national</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">um local and international level because</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">how do you like when you try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">jump start diverse</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">sort of value-added agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">economies in a region that come along</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">a re-inhabitation of the land and more</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">more ice-to-acre</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">ratio and more work on on regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">landscape and making it more productive</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">you can bring in lots of innovation in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:33.240" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">new buyer materials bio</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.240" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">biopharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">all sorts of areas um but</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">if those small businesses have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">compete with rules that were supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">protecting workers or protecting</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:51.919" style="s2">health but they basically the classic</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">example here in europe is always</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.919" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">the little 300 year old cheese maker</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">somewhere in france</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">that has to close down because they</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">can&#39;t put tiles on the ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:04.080" style="s2">of the kitchen whether that cheese has</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">been made for generations</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.080" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">because some law says now for hygiene</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">reasons you have to have tiles</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">on ceilings and floors yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">those kind of things that we also need</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">really look at um like where i was going</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:20.400" style="s2">earlier is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">miguel ramirez and i have realized that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">to create these four pilot projects</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">around mallorca doing this work you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">actually have to talk to the government</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">and declare them some somehow</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">zones of innovation and and and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">get a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">um precedence put through the legal</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:40.240" style="s2">system that says</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">there are certain areas where people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.240" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">trying to do innovative things around</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">um eco settlements regeneration of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">land um</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">rehydrating the land reforestation soil</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">and so on and so forth and we can&#39;t slow</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">them down with</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">with all that red tape we we can just</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">let them do and then we come after the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">fact and we study what they&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">certify it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s absolutely critical</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">as having those</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">those spaces and places where people can</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">that you can set it up and they can</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">see what&#39;s happening and it&#39;s in it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">example that they can look to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">it may work it may not work it may work</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">in different ways than you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">imagine but there&#39;s a place that you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.640" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">start to demonstrate that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">and and i just um actually just in uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">kenya</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:31.200" style="s2">just yesterday i&#39;ve been talking with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">group there recently we&#39;ve just got to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">the point now where the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">um the agriculture minister has given a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">piece of land</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">uh and support to actually set up a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">demonstration</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">and then that will be the place where</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">extension workers can come in and start</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">to learn and then be able to rip all</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">that out</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">it just needs a place and from that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">to be a and that that maybe it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">relaxed it&#39;s something special that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">you work with them to get excited about</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">that the same thing happened with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">city farm in brisbane</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">there were no rules for city farms to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">happen there were there was no</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">urban agriculture to happen in the city</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">there was no there were no rules for</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">growing and harvesting food</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">by community on community land uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">we had to kind of break the rules a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">and work</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">closely in conjunction with them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">they i remember actually in the very</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">uh meetings with the mayor saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">well we&#39;ll come back and we&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">this in a year we&#39;ll give you a year to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how you go in that time and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">they they actually didn&#39;t come back</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">in a year i noticed in that next year we</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">were there</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">on their platform for re-election</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">because they realized what a such a good</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">project was and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">great traction it had created in</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.720" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">generating</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">interest around sustainable living in</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">the city and i can imagine as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">these projects do start to happen that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">all these other things will start to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">emerge out of it and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">the uh sort of the new ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">excitement and the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">possibilities will just start to come</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">out of those it&#39;s kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">there&#39;s this mycelium network that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">going on all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">and it starts to connect wherever we put</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">compost on it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">really you know get very busy underneath</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">and then all of a sudden these places</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">that pop up which is the flowering the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">fruiting body of this mycelium network</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">if we shine a light on that enough and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">mature and and then the spores kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">start to go out it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like that we need these little</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">mushroom these mushrooms to come up</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">and uh and that&#39;s what those examples</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">are that people can see and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">it does mean pushing boundaries it does</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">people relaxing regulations it does mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">making exceptions and i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">until we get that that we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">kind of take a quantum leap out of where</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">we are now</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">but it does take that big picture</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">thinking and to excite other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">about being part of that big picture</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because this reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">of a conversation i had with joel</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">glansberg and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">and you know how i love all that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">kind of regenesis tribe and their deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">in regenerative developments and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">sometimes i kind of bump into a certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">that they have a little bit of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">no nose um</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">where i kind of say well maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">yes and rather than a no no</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">um kind of thing that&#39;s the only bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">where i sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">don&#39;t resonate with with their approach</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:32.080" style="s2">kind of clear delineation of well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">not working regeneratively</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.080" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">and in in in one conversation with joe</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:38.880" style="s2">he was explaining his wonderful work</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">world with this</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.880" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">um this drylands um</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">permaculture research institute and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">and building up</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.919" style="s2">a demonstration site in in a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">tricky climate kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">high altitude desert in near thousand</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:56.720" style="s2">new mexico</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">and um how he when they</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.720" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">had put in all this amazing work to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">basically create this oasis in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">desertifying region um and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">created a little video to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">zooming in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">on on google maps onto this this little</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">oasis and you could see the desert and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">this green spot would appear and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">then he</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">said that when he&#39;d finish that video</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.279" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">and about this place</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">he initially was very chuffed and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">in the middle of the night woke up</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">and and realized that he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">been climbing up the wrong ladder or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">rather that was leaning against the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">wrong wall kind of thing or</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">like that that he&#39;d actually it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">success but somehow it was a failure</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">because it was only that small piece of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">and the area around it had stayed the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.919" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">same and and so he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">what process could i have worked on that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:55.520" style="s2">would have done what what you just sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">of described and that&#39;s where i find the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">two come together</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">that we need to create these</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">demonstration spots but</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">but what happens with the energy that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">goes into demonstration sites because it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">is so difficult very often</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">people disappear into their local</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">project what happened with so many eco</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">villages where</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">without any negative intention the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">the kind of intentional community</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">settlers just focused on getting their</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">infrastructure up</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">and before they knew it they were 20</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">years into the story and had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">forgotten the the relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">wider</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:29.039" style="s2">region because they were so busy on</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">their project</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.039" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">and and i think what we&#39;ve learned from</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">i totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">from that first wave is that we do need</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">to do both we need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s hard work and it takes most of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">the effort initially</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">to do the work on the ground locally but</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">but the more you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:48.399" style="s2">from the beginning work with others in</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">your region that are also doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.399" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">something similar and the more you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">coordinate actions in order to do these</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">things like changing planning laws</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">building inroads to to local government</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">and even building inroads to to um there</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">are some</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">regional businesses that are happy to</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:07.039" style="s2">fund</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">positive projects in their region and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.039" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">and we need to like a bit sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">what judy wicks did with with bali i</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">think it&#39;s just changed name</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s common something yeah did you</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.240" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">remember the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">real name of bali i know it is barley i</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t know the changed name</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">yeah um the business aligned for local</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">local living economies</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">um they just changed commons future or</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.880" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">other i can&#39;t remember anyway but but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">for me i&#39;m talking so much about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">because i find that tension quite strong</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">how to how to refocus my attention more</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">to the local because i feel like if</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve done 20 years of doing wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">work building courses</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">but i&#39;ve also seen you in in really</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">effective ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">reach beyond this demonstration</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">site and an institute and so i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">hear a little bit more like</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">share with because you do all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">wonderful interviews with people on your</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">on your</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">um youtube channel and now you started a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">and um and i i would</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">love to hear more about your story</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">because you you set up the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">education institute and and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">our permaculture live youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:23.600" style="s2">and and you&#39;re doing some work in</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">in africa and then then i&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">something called ethos foundation</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">um which i don&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">tell me a bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">about the different projects yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">so i mean right from the very start i</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">i realized that it it&#39;s just exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">what you said it&#39;s not enough just to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:43.760" style="s2">this project it&#39;s always about how</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">there&#39;s that relationship elsewhere like</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.760" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">even for example with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">just going back to that city farm</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">project that as we were doing that work</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">rather than getting drawn in and just</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">focusing on that what we would do every</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">time we&#39;d have these um</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">monthly gatherings and we&#39;d get people</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">to bring food down to share and what we</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">would do we would raise money</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">um for a project somewhere else in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.559" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">world so maybe it would have been um</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">in africa or bhutan or indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">community and there would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.520" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">and we&#39;d start to realize that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">projects all around the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">in every community that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">similar things to us and that by doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">it&#39;s lifting this whole movement and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">i guess that sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">always of telling the story so i started</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">out telling the story locally i would go</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">share with communities and i&#39;d go on</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:31.919" style="s2">local radio</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">and and just keep on sharing that story</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.919" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">out and then going and visiting places</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">and bringing those stories back</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">and so always that sharing sharing</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">stories sharing</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">trying to sort of build a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">around this um</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">i got invited by the brisbane city</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">council which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">uh it&#39;s kind of an interesting council</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:50.159" style="s2">that it is really a regional council</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.159" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">councils in the world i think uh and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">they invited me to come in and write a</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">sustainable food policy for their</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">metropolitan planning</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.640" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">process to look at how to integrate you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">know city farms and community gardens</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">and community food systems and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">street trees and all different sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:13.480" style="s2">things into their planning thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">so uh when was that oh gosh um</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.480" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">2005 i know maybe before then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">sorry i&#39;m a little bit vague on that but</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">so the idea was that you know that what</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">we&#39;re learning and then also people</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">would be constantly</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">calling me up and saying i&#39;d like to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">a community gun starting can you come</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">and help us and i was getting so many</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">that i started up with a group of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">friends something called the australian</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">city farms and community gardens network</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">and then we started gathering people</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">around so that we&#39;d build this</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">sort of reference group and a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">learning group</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">and so that&#39;s still going now so always</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">trying to take the learning from</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">locally and and building that out making</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">it visible making it available</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">and then from so now based here at</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">crystal waters</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a few different things that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">mentioned i</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">used to mostly do face-to-face teaching</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">and it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">people would come here to crystal waters</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">and they would be doing a permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">and they&#39;d be coming from all around the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">world because crystal waters is a united</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">nations world habitat award-winning eco</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">village and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a place that people came to have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">look so we would typically have half the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">people from</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">australia around australia and half the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:20.480" style="s2">people from around the world i guess</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">similar to in finton those people from</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">all over coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">and so they would come here and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">they would say oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">this is amazing could you come to our</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">community and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">and teach a course like this and help us</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">to run and get a program set up so then</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">we would go</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">to that community so evan and i were</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">based pre kids were basically traveling</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">around the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">teaching permaculture courses visiting</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">communities and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">just and then learning along the way and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">bringing that back in so this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">constant exchange</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">and then we started the digital age</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:52.079" style="s2">started to enter and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">when i i kind of didn&#39;t really get into</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.079" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">it to start with and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">there was a woman called rhonda hetzel</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">this is this is her book down to earth</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s important work but it&#39;s also uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">how again it&#39;s a question of balance how</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">to keep putting this out</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">and keeping the local practice going</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">well what i&#39;m finding interesting now is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">um so you asked about the ethos</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">foundation so i have the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">so i have um there&#39;s our permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">life which is the community education</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">i run master classes so the master</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">classes i run every month and they they</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">have about</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">2 000 people who sign up to those and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">then there&#39;s videos that go out i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">just started a podcast and just recently</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">interviewed um frichoff capra and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">um just about to interview the um the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">founder of one million women and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s called sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">changing world so that&#39;s all the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">that i just</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">um stories that i&#39;m gathering and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">sharing and putting out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">then there&#39;s a permaculture education</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">institute which is where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">my goal with that is to try and teach as</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">many new permaculture teachers</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.040" style="s2">as possible so that it&#39;s not just you</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">know a hobby but it&#39;s actually a way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">life and there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">who are rippling out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">going out and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">actually being of service in communities</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">everywhere and this being their their</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">way of life</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">um so that&#39;s online</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">and what i found what my goal with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">was that every time someone signed up on</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:41.520" style="s2">that course i would donate a course to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:43.520" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">in some part of the world where they</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">couldn&#39;t afford it</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">and then i got to the point realizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">actually well</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">they probably don&#39;t have the internet to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">access this so then i started creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">the ethos foundation and supporting</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">local courses in places like</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">like africa um india and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">many parts of the world where you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">the different kind of economic</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">level so mostly i&#39;m focusing in east</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">africa at the moment so every week</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">i&#39;m talking with with groups over there</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">mentoring local teachers who are then</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:15.520" style="s2">teaching</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">other teachers and the main pro main</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.520" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">thing that&#39;s happening at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">setting up perma youth groups and these</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">are even in refugee camps so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">mentoring teachers in those camps who</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">groups of kids who are transforming the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">landscapes and taking</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">permaculture back to their their little</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">huts</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">and making food gardens around those and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">and i was just talking to one woman</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">sakina today and i was i was asking her</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">she lives in kokuma refugee camp now</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">kakuma refugee camp is in the north west</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">dry part of kenya and um</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">and she&#39;s from from from the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">republic of congo</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">and she&#39;s been there 11 years and i was</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">asking her so so really you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">the future for you and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">you know lots of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">living there there&#39;s 200 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">living there</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">and she said look you know there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">few people who ever get out of here and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">go to somewhere like canada or australia</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">or america</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">but mostly we&#39;re just here this is it</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">we we have no concept of ever being able</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">to go back to our country because the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">war continues</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:22.400" style="s2">so we just have to kind of take it that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">this is where we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.400" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">and so now there&#39;s this big wave of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">things like permaculture starting to</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">emerge there to go okay well</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.960" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">how do we make this place a livable</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">place how do we grow food rather than</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">just being dependent</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">on aid and particularly at this point in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">time when um</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">at covert the aid was chopped in half in</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">terms of their food</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">there&#39;s massive amounts of hunger</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">happening and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">the the desperate need for people to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">added to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">have this knowledge about how to grow um</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">you know polycultural kitchen gardens</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">whereas a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">knowledge that they had about growing</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">was about just</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">rice and corn rice and corn with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">chemical agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">type system so there&#39;s this real</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">flourishing of that and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">the ethos foundation is about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">support new teachers and also provide</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">resources for permaculture education</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">this is wonderful describe to me a</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">like a kind of online mentoring call</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">with one of those local groups</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">what would you kind of advise them on or</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">do you do you kind of give them ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">what they can do with the kids in terms</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:31.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">um little exercises or do you send them</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.359" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">pdfs of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">um drawings of a compost toilet or how</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">do you how do you support them</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">all of that so but i</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">really avoid being prescriptive and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:46.800" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">okay this is what you need to teach them</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.800" end="00:42:50.480" style="s2">go ahead and teach that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">so we&#39;ve had lots of conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">you know what is the situation like</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">they&#39;ve sent me photographs they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">brought me through with the video camera</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.440" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">um i really asked them what are their</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">you know what&#39;s their situation then we</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">come together</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">out and find out what are those what are</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">the key starting points and so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">it is about</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">um accessing land and tools and seeds</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">composting systems so i look at what</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:14.880" style="s2">they&#39;ve got there and basic things like</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">composting and mulching and um holly</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.880" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">um toilet systems all of those sorts of</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">soil and ask them what they see and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">we kind of explore it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">they talk about their soil and how we</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">can actually reach a more living soil</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">other times i say what&#39;s happening in</p>

<p begin="00:44:01.280" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">they had some problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">and it ended up being not what they</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">thought so we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">we unpacked all that for them um</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.839" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">it it&#39;s really whatever it is just but</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">all it ends up being also people care</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.319" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">you know that family then needs support</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">for the funeral and all those things so</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">little bit of money to send them um</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">so they can get a camera and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.319" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">microphone</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:14.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking about how much it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:16.079" style="s2">costs and all that stuff and he says</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.960" end="00:45:17.760" style="s2">i could probably get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.079" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">cheaper one so then i could leave a bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">left to get a guitar</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">and i said oh you want a guitar and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">said yeah because they&#39;re all musicians</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:25.520" style="s2">and we&#39;d love to actually write songs</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.520" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">permaculture and this way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">things so then we can start to share the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">more rapidly and further if it&#39;s a song</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s going to get shared around so i</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">said look</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">with an extraordinarily high cost and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">asked his can</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">project is and so she went across to the</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">camp checked it all out and came back</p>

<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">going to start building relationships</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">with them and so yeah</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">um perma youth groups but the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.119" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">really excites me is that this</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">the perma youth global network that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">starting to form</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">around this and it&#39;s it&#39;s generative</p>

<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">yeah in wales and um they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:23.040" style="s2">like the primary school kids</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">there was this sense that actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:45.280" style="s2">that they&#39;d go on the strikes and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">they&#39;d come back to school</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.280" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">or wherever come back home and life</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">would be the same it&#39;s like well what</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.119" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">in terms of the learning that you can</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">and that that goes back into</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">them actually engaging with analog</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:12.800" style="s2">people in their local</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">something that i&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">a lot about in particular because the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">course that i run the permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">design course and permaculture teacher</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:24.640" style="s2">course is also</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">an online one and that&#39;s really about</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.640" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">how do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">how do we ground that as well so for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:31.599" style="s2">perma youth</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">in particular um we have little local</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.599" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">hubs</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">and so for example the group here when</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">they can they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:41.200" style="s2">local camps um you know the group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">working in the refugee camp they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.200" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">their community garden that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">that they work on and then they take</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">videos of that and then they share that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:51.680" style="s2">with someone else and this group</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">um there&#39;s a boy who who joins him from</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.680" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">sweden and he and his mates get together</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">and do some gardens there</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">um and then they send it in and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:01.520" style="s2">another girl from another part</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:02.079" style="s2">she works with her local friends doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.520" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.079" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">wild harvesting and so then they share</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">that in so each group</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.440" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">has their own particular focus and they</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:11.280" style="s2">do their own particular</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">local work and then together when they</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.280" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">it&#39;s this sense of being part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">something much larger than themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">that before</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">gardening seemed a little bit maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">quite an activism</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">thing not something that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">make any difference in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">actually they&#39;re realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">it is helping people to like</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:31.839" style="s2">particularly because they</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.559" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">now have this relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.839" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">refugees and they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">growing a garden saving your seeds</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">learning how to compost and mulch</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:42.079" style="s2">is the difference between life and death</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">the gardening</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.079" end="00:53:44.800" style="s2">and then they start to talk with other</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">farmers we bring in people from</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.800" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">different groups to connect with them as</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">well and they learn about</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">you know their um how healthy soil</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">absorbs carbon more than unhealthy soil</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:53:57.040" style="s2">so then they become climate activists</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.760" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">because they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.040" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">so there&#39;s very much a groundedness that</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">happens with this as well as this</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">this connectedness with with different</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">pers so get that multiple description</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">which is very much the kind of nora</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">baits in type of approach that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at something but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:15.200" style="s2">so many different descriptions and by</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:16.720" style="s2">throwing ourselves into the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">complexity of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.720" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">and seeing what happened into that kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:23.359" style="s2">of soup and into steeping in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">we get this amazing understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.359" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">because we&#39;re completely immersed in it</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">from so many different ways so</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s never always online um</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just as like we were saying before</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the flip side of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">you&#39;re saying before</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">how if you&#39;re only just in a project on</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">you become myopic it&#39;s the same as if</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">you&#39;re only online and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">there&#39;s these spectrums and that by</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:49.119" style="s2">part of all them being conscious about</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">being part of part of all the different</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">realms i think is really interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:54.079" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">so i&#39;d do the same thing with the course</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.079" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">as well by the time people have finished</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">that course not only have they got to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">know all their local neighbors and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">explored their buyer region they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">connected with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">indigenous leaders of the area they have</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">designs for their place they&#39;ve started</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">developing their gardens</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">they&#39;ve started teaching permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">and then they graduate</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s but it&#39;s only through</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">being engaged in all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">um and so the the online part is really</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:21.359" style="s2">for the conversations it&#39;s for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">making sense it&#39;s for getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">into the detail of things but it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">you set up</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:28.559" style="s2">programs i mean earlier i was quite</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">surprised to hear you say that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.559" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">permaculture teaching</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">course has 2 000 people signed up to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">that means that you must have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">structure where</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">as you scale as as more people sign up</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">to it it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">like even if if you only</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">gave um each one of them 15 minutes one</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">to one conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">you&#39;d hit a glass ceiling very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">on what you&#39;re capable of doing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">a normal way 2 000 people is for a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">master class so i</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:04.160" style="s2">each month i run a master class</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">on a different topic and each time some</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.160" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">uh it&#39;s from the group that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">with the topic</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s something that gets woven into</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">the permaculture course but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.440" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">permaculture course itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">has just a few hundred people in it</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:20.000" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">takes all my energy to maintain people</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.000" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">people kind of um buy into a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">apple scheme it&#39;s just free it&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">okay it&#39;s just free</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">yeah and so so you people can suggest</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">anything you would run a master class on</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">and then you</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">pick the one that that you do next kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">of thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t pick they pick so we kind of put</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.680" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">it out there these and people nominate</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">um in the chat you know i look to see</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">which ones seem to be having the highest</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">one so</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:51.280" style="s2">the last one was about eco villages the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">next one is actually going to be about</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.280" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">community gardens i&#39;ve done things about</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">soil i&#39;ve done things about</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">how do you actually make money out of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">permacultures there was a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">interest about that at one point so i</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">whatever it is i even did one about how</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:07.599" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">how to how to do public speaking and how</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.599" end="00:57:11.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">you know share your stories how do how</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.760" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">so i&#39;ve i&#39;ve done 26 now i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">yeah because you&#39;ve been in this for so</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:22.880" style="s2">long and you also</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:24.799" style="s2">you&#39;re both a permaculture and an eco</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.880" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">village ambassador</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.799" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of like we&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:32.640" style="s2">different paths but we share</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">very similar histories in in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.640" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">um and and friends and i&#39;m i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:41.599" style="s2">right now there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">like i&#39;m observing that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.599" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">feel really strongly called</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">into community as a as the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">response and there&#39;s a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">hyper educated</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">and also might as well be honest about</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">the privileged people</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">who have a spectrum of choices to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:57:58.559" style="s2">what am i going to do with my life now</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.559" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">new situation i suddenly say no we need</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:04.079" style="s2">we need these examples we need these</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">these lifeboats we need these</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.079" end="00:58:08.559" style="s2">these lighthouses we need these and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.400" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">it sounds so what i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.559" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">20 years ago and some some of the elders</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">have heard 40</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:19.359" style="s2">50 years ago when when the eco village</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">movement really kicked off um</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.359" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">how like because we learned lessons</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">from what we sort of already spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">this kind of sinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">into this let&#39;s let&#39;s just get all our</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:32.160" style="s2">friends together and buy some land and</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">live happily ever after on this land</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.160" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">that we steward and care for and</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">and become self-sufficient and and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">feel like most</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">eco villagers have eventually learned</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:43.839" style="s2">that that self-sufficiency is is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:46.640" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.839" end="00:58:48.640" style="s2">missed goal like um you can increase</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.640" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">your self-reliance but you&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.640" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t be self-sufficient in a world</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">that is based on</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">being relational beings being in</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.480" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">connection with everything</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">into being um how can we guide this new</p>

<p begin="00:59:33.040" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:39.040" style="s2">like we&#39;re in another cycle of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">creative process and it just comes as an</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">impulse and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">normal but how do we keep it</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:50.000" style="s2">from people disappearing into these</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">these little projects and and not doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">um turning what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">into the yogurt culture that turns the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.280" end="01:00:01.680" style="s2">the milk of the region</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:06.319" style="s2">into into yogurt kind of approach</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">what&#39;s your take on that what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.319" end="01:00:10.640" style="s2">feeling at the moment is that there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">so many</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.640" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">fantastic examples that are out there</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:16.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">still are not really visible you know we</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.640" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">have the magnificent eco village network</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">that connects</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:24.160" style="s2">so many but if you are looking for what</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:25.119" style="s2">most people see when they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.160" end="01:00:27.599" style="s2">housing choices</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.119" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not really visible so one of my one</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.599" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">of my key goals is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:32.079" style="s2">help to make those visible wherever i</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:34.079" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.079" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of that eco village</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.079" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">ambassador or starting to take</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:40.240" style="s2">um you know in i managed to get a story</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.240" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">a really mainstream magazine just the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:46.640" style="s2">other day just about</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">um you know our life here and our house</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:48.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">our community as just a different way of</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.880" end="01:00:53.200" style="s2">talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">um but i also think that there is no one</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.200" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:00:58.079" style="s2">so for example there&#39;s a lot of young</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">people who&#39;ve started to move out here</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.079" end="01:01:01.599" style="s2">to crystal waters and finding ways to</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">move here and there they have a sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.599" end="01:01:05.119" style="s2">that you know they are really well</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">educated they&#39;re looking for something</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.119" end="01:01:07.760" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">but what i&#39;m hearing them talk about is</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.760" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">actually buying a piece of land</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">and doing it together but because they</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">are so</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">connected differently than what we were</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">say 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">because of the communication systems</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.200" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">that we have they will not be</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">disconnected from the world in that way</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.520" end="01:01:27.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.640" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2">disappear into that hole on the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:30.319" style="s2">side then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">you know there&#39;s all this whole movement</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.319" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">the retro suburbia so david holmgren&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:01:53.520" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">um you know on your show notes as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">because</p>

<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">called the downshifter</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">shifters guide to a resilient future so</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">he&#39;s really talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:10.480" style="s2">look you know we obviously need to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.480" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">but let&#39;s do it where we are let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">differently about the suburbs</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:18.720" style="s2">you know particularly when we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">you know in places like australia</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.720" end="01:02:22.480" style="s2">most people live in the suburbs and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">actually in the suburbs there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.480" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">spare land</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">in between the houses you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">about pulling down fences sharing things</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:31.280" style="s2">doing um shared housing and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">other so that&#39;s kind of the retro</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">suburbia model and i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:36.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge potential for that to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:38.559" style="s2">something to</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.400" end="01:02:40.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m seeing a shift happening in that</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.559" end="01:02:41.760" style="s2">here in australia anyway</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">then there&#39;s other friends of mine who</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.760" end="01:02:45.359" style="s2">are working in in urban projects and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.359" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">um sort of collaborative design so the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:52.880" style="s2">newer version of the co-housing model so</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:54.319" style="s2">there&#39;s all new names</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.880" end="01:02:56.000" style="s2">for all the things that have been around</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.319" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">for a while but i can kind of see that</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.000" end="01:03:01.039" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">really engaged design process so like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.039" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">community design or citizen design</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">kind of engagement in that and creating</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">shared spaces but</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.839" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen with</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:13.599" style="s2">that now because of covert</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">you sort of wonder where that design</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.599" end="01:03:17.119" style="s2">shift is going to happen because</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:18.720" style="s2">there was this whole thing about people</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.119" end="01:03:20.640" style="s2">going into smaller</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">units but having more shared lounge room</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.640" end="01:03:25.440" style="s2">shared kitchen shared laundry</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">and that seemed to be the big trend in</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.440" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">urban living</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">but if people are sort of going oh i</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:31.119" style="s2">don&#39;t know if i want to share so much</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:32.720" style="s2">now with covert</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.119" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">then whether we might need to think</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.720" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">differently again about it so this</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">i think we&#39;re kind of we&#39;re in the soup</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:41.520" style="s2">at the moment and i&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:43.280" style="s2">which direction it&#39;s going to go well i</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.520" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">i have</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.280" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s a tricky one because</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">the minute you like if you create</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve certainly heard some people talking</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">about sort of bubble formation in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:56.000" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">um creating a social network of people</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:04:02.079" style="s2">who share adjacent pieces of land that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">that you then in case of future</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.079" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">lockdowns</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">um you know that</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">you have this group of people that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">still have interactions with</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2">um because you trust that they are also</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">taking</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">the right precautions and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:18.960" style="s2">a sort of shared level of</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:20.319" style="s2">of um how to respond to precaution with</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.960" end="01:04:22.480" style="s2">regard to the virus</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.319" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s i mean again it&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.480" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">that&#39;s for some privileged people that</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.880" end="01:04:28.000" style="s2">they can possibly sort themselves out</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:30.000" style="s2">that way or</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.000" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">other people just do it naturally with</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.000" end="01:04:34.079" style="s2">two or three neighbors and</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:35.760" style="s2">the kind of properties that that join</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.079" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">together in their backyard</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.760" end="01:04:41.440" style="s2">back backyard but um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:42.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a tricky one i see it in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.440" end="01:04:46.640" style="s2">own life right now with</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.559" end="01:04:46.640" style="s2">having a three-year-old and um really</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.960" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">having taken the approach that the first</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:53.200" style="s2">two or three years</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to be in a quite close to mama</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.200" end="01:04:58.480" style="s2">and papa um like mainly focused on us</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.680" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">because if you look at child development</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.480" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s really what what they&#39;re mainly</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.079" end="01:05:04.720" style="s2">needing the the the support um of their</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:06.559" style="s2">direct parents but then comes that</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.720" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">really important socialization phase</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.559" end="01:05:08.960" style="s2">where they need to engage with lots of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:11.039" style="s2">other kids and see</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.960" end="01:05:12.799" style="s2">other parenting models and the whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.039" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">takes a village to raise a child</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.799" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">and now finding this bizarre situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:22.880" style="s2">that we need to think about how do we</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:23.680" style="s2">help her socialize without putting her</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:27.039" style="s2">and ask</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.680" end="01:05:30.400" style="s2">at risk and um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.039" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit concerning</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.400" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">just at a point where we really need to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.839" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">um rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.160" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">cultivate social cohesion and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:43.200" style="s2">collaboration at the neighborhood and</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">community level again</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.200" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">to now have to do this</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:50.160" style="s2">virtually even if the guy&#39;s sitting next</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">door because you can&#39;t go and have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.160" end="01:05:52.960" style="s2">meeting with more than three people or</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">five people or 15 people</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.960" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">yeah um it&#39;s i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">i haven&#39;t seen mandy for mandy macklin</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:02.799" style="s2">from irma</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:03.839" style="s2">who mentioned her a couple of times for</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.799" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.839" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">and we&#39;re on the same island it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re in the soup um</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">it is and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s i&#39;ve actually and you know i feel</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:22.880" style="s2">privileged you know we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:26.240" style="s2">privilege that to be in this place</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:28.079" style="s2">here at crystal waters because we</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.240" end="01:06:29.760" style="s2">there is a kind of a sense of a bubble</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.079" end="01:06:32.640" style="s2">here that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.760" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">we have this sense of safety i suppose</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.640" end="01:06:36.960" style="s2">within this community and like you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:38.559" style="s2">my friend my friends my my kids have</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.960" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">just gone off camping with their friends</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.559" end="01:06:41.200" style="s2">tonight i don&#39;t even know where they are</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">they&#39;re somewhere over that way</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.200" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">camping beside the river somewhere with</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">the other kids and</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:47.280" style="s2">you know the other night they were doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:48.319" style="s2">that as well and they just there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.280" end="01:06:51.599" style="s2">sense of freedom</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.319" end="01:06:52.720" style="s2">in this space because we have such a</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.720" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">trust and also that isolation here</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">so i think that i think we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">are in quite a a different situation</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:04.960" style="s2">than what a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:06.799" style="s2">particularly because queensland itself</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.960" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really got any cases so i think</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.799" end="01:07:11.440" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:13.440" style="s2">we&#39;re quite quite isolated and</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.440" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how i would manage my</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.440" end="01:07:15.839" style="s2">thinking if i was</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.480" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">in a different place if i was saying</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.839" end="01:07:19.440" style="s2">victoria or in you know in spain</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.440" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">how i might manage that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">know not being not having</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">been in the midst of that no it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:29.200" style="s2">fascinating i&#39;ve noticed this</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:30.720" style="s2">like when when here in spain things</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.200" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">started to get really bad</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.720" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">i i could hear just just the way people</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:37.520" style="s2">friends were commenting</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:39.839" style="s2">um and and assessing the situation um</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.520" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">on social media um and you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.839" end="01:07:43.680" style="s2">thought well you</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">in an area where it hasn&#39;t hit yet so</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.680" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about something that you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:48.480" style="s2">absolutely no</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.079" end="01:07:50.079" style="s2">idea of what it actually feels like and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.480" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">and then when when we were in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.079" end="01:07:53.119" style="s2">of a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:54.960" style="s2">pretty aggressive lockdown of not being</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.119" end="01:07:56.880" style="s2">able to to go out and having police</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.960" end="01:07:58.000" style="s2">patrol the streets and find people and</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.880" end="01:08:01.599" style="s2">be quite</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.000" end="01:08:04.079" style="s2">um kind of strong state</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.599" end="01:08:05.920" style="s2">imposing on stupid citizens who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.079" end="01:08:09.280" style="s2">behave</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.920" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">and but but now</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.280" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">right now here in spain things have</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:13.039" style="s2">opened up and and they&#39;re more worried</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:15.280" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s another wave coming and but</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.280" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">it at the same time people in</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">argentina are still in lockdown and have</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:26.880" style="s2">since early march and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">so it really is very different in</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.880" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">different places and depending on your</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">level of privilege and</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:34.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a tricky one so we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:36.000" style="s2">lockdown as a community</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.560" end="01:08:38.319" style="s2">as opposed to being you know like we</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.000" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">don&#39;t go out very much from this place</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.319" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">and we&#39;ve set up a whole lot of mutual</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:44.400" style="s2">aid systems to encourage people to</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:46.480" style="s2">you know we we order from the store and</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.400" end="01:08:46.719" style="s2">we have bulk ordering and we it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.480" end="01:08:48.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.719" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">so through that community structure that</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.799" end="01:08:52.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">set up systems to help to to manage</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.799" end="01:08:55.839" style="s2">that and to be aware of it but i have</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:58.319" style="s2">heard a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.839" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">talking about you know um wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:02.719" style="s2">start up</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:03.679" style="s2">uh community land trusts starting to</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.679" end="01:09:08.960" style="s2">well a few months ago we were saying</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:10.560" style="s2">well living out in the in the rural</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.960" end="01:09:12.159" style="s2">areas is</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.560" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to do that we love the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:15.279" style="s2">city we love the city life</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">that&#39;s where we want to be we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.279" end="01:09:18.400" style="s2">to do that kind of eco living we want</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:20.480" style="s2">eco living in the city</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.400" end="01:09:22.799" style="s2">and i&#39;m hearing a lot of i&#39;m turning</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.480" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">around now saying actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.799" end="01:09:26.560" style="s2">no i think the rural areas is where we</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">want to go but how do we buy land</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.560" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">we need to buy land together looking at</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">community land trusts where you can also</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">community um housing where it&#39;s a rent</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:36.480" style="s2">to buy</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:38.319" style="s2">type of situation so there&#39;s a whole lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.480" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">of really interesting new models that</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.319" end="01:09:41.359" style="s2">are starting to emerge that are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">based on the things that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.359" end="01:09:45.040" style="s2">doing for a while but</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.880" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">new and different and interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.040" end="01:09:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:51.759" style="s2">exciting time in terms of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.040" end="01:09:53.199" style="s2">you know that emergence of new models of</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.759" end="01:09:56.480" style="s2">of housing</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.199" end="01:09:59.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m really sort of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.480" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">all ears and all eyes trying to see what</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.440" end="01:10:03.199" style="s2">is happening and what&#39;s emerging and how</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:04.880" style="s2">i can you know possibly support that</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.199" end="01:10:06.800" style="s2">and at the same time looking differently</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:08.800" style="s2">here within crystal waters that</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">there&#39;s now a time and we&#39;ve got a group</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.800" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">here that&#39;s looking well how can we</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.080" end="01:10:12.800" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">a new village within the village so</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.800" end="01:10:16.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a new little section that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">going in as part of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.080" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">visitors area where there&#39;ll be sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:20.320" style="s2">a tiny home village a lot of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:22.080" style="s2">homes</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.320" end="01:10:24.400" style="s2">where there was just one dwelling on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.080" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">lot now has multiple dwellings or</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.400" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">you know little tiny homes and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.960" end="01:10:32.080" style="s2">cottages and things so we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">getting higher density</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.080" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">which is really great really wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:38.159" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.320" end="01:10:40.000" style="s2">because yeah that&#39;s the whole density</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.159" end="01:10:42.239" style="s2">issue is like how do we</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.000" end="01:10:43.280" style="s2">it&#39;s so clear that cities have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">footprint</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.280" end="01:10:46.640" style="s2">footprint and an impact beyond what</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.159" end="01:10:48.880" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:51.280" style="s2">possibly be sustainable in the long term</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.880" end="01:10:54.880" style="s2">like the the mega cities of the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.280" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">but but at the same time um</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.880" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">in terms of the numbers of us to to all</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.960" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:01.679" style="s2">in rural eco village idyllic scenarios</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.960" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.679" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">um also</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.440" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">hard to imagine that we have enough land</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:11.760" style="s2">to make that possible and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">but then like this this just reminds me</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.760" end="01:11:14.560" style="s2">of something that we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">about in the very beginning that i</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.560" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">actually wanted to pick up on um</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:20.400" style="s2">which is this whole thing about</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:22.719" style="s2">rewinding and protecting land</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.400" end="01:11:23.600" style="s2">and how that can backfire yeah like i</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.719" end="01:11:27.199" style="s2">find it like</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.600" end="01:11:30.719" style="s2">um of course</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.199" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">healing ecosystems is the work of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.719" end="01:11:34.640" style="s2">21st century like</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:37.199" style="s2">planetary healing and healing ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.640" end="01:11:40.320" style="s2">to rebalance the global climate</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.199" end="01:11:42.000" style="s2">system and avoid the hemorrhaging of of</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.320" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">biodiversity that is going on</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.000" end="01:11:45.840" style="s2">um to to continue is is clearly what we</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">need to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.840" end="01:11:49.679" style="s2">but but what i&#39;m concerned is that about</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:51.840" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.679" end="01:11:52.840" style="s2">as long as we have these mental models</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.840" end="01:11:55.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.840" end="01:11:57.199" style="s2">separate nature and culture to the point</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.520" end="01:11:59.520" style="s2">that culture is other</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.199" end="01:12:00.719" style="s2">then you the minute you speak about re</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.520" end="01:12:04.080" style="s2">wilding</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.719" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">it&#39;s well who&#39;s who&#39;s allowed in there</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.080" end="01:12:08.239" style="s2">and who&#39;s not allowed in there</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:10.080" style="s2">and and as you were hinting quotes that</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.239" end="01:12:13.600" style="s2">even indigenous people are kept</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.080" end="01:12:16.000" style="s2">out of their ancestral sites because now</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.600" end="01:12:19.520" style="s2">this is a somehow a declared</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.000" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">no-go biodiversity hotspot and</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.520" end="01:12:24.239" style="s2">it&#39;s just bizarre because why is it a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:26.080" style="s2">biodiversity hotspot because it has</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.239" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">co-evolved with one species that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.080" end="01:12:30.480" style="s2">actually did its job really well</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:32.560" style="s2">a custodian species called homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.480" end="01:12:34.880" style="s2">sapiens that is actually worth its</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.560" end="01:12:37.040" style="s2">name which is the case with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.880" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.040" end="01:12:40.320" style="s2">people and not so much with our western</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.320" end="01:12:43.760" style="s2">do you get this kind of rewinding in</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.760" end="01:12:47.199" style="s2">as well where people are kind of trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">to create these</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.199" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">only for non-human life forms</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">reserves or</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.000" end="01:12:57.760" style="s2">yeah we have a lot of national parks and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.960" end="01:13:01.040" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.760" end="01:13:02.880" style="s2">that can&#39;t happen but we also have</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.040" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">uh things like say just even taking</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.880" end="01:13:06.880" style="s2">crystal waters for example we have 640</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:09.360" style="s2">acres here but at least half of it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.880" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">being put aside as just being forested</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.360" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">area but not not as a sort of a no-go</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.239" end="01:13:14.960" style="s2">zone</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">we we go into there and we harvest you</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.960" end="01:13:17.679" style="s2">know some timbers or different sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:20.640" style="s2">things or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.679" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s a it is a re-wilding</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.640" end="01:13:24.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:26.880" style="s2">exclusion zone um but yeah though</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.640" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">the national parks um are locked up in</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.880" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">in many places but</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">we&#39;re now starting to see a shift in uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:34.960" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">managing by indigenous communities so</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.960" end="01:13:38.000" style="s2">that is changing</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:39.520" style="s2">which is fantastic and we just started</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.000" end="01:13:42.400" style="s2">working um the</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.520" end="01:13:45.199" style="s2">global eco village network of oceania</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.400" end="01:13:47.920" style="s2">region has started working with</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.199" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">jambon which is a jambon i mean sorry</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.920" end="01:13:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of a region up near just</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.440" end="01:13:56.239" style="s2">inland from the</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.120" end="01:13:57.679" style="s2">the great barrier reef and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.239" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">what they&#39;re trying to work on is</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.679" end="01:14:02.159" style="s2">actually to create that as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">as an eco nation so instead of an eco</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.159" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">village thinking about it as a nation</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:08.239" style="s2">because as you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:10.080" style="s2">australia doesn&#39;t really exist from the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.239" end="01:14:12.320" style="s2">perspective of indigenous communities it</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:14.320" style="s2">was actually a whole lot of nations</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.320" end="01:14:15.600" style="s2">and those nations corresponded with</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.320" end="01:14:19.040" style="s2">bioregions</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.600" end="01:14:21.199" style="s2">and so where this bioregion um</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.040" end="01:14:23.120" style="s2">that corresponds with the jumbo nation</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.199" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">up in the north of queensland</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.120" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">uh does actually incorporate a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.440" end="01:14:27.760" style="s2">forested area and part of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.120" end="01:14:30.640" style="s2">trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.760" end="01:14:31.679" style="s2">is to take more of it back into a</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.640" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.679" end="01:14:37.679" style="s2">uh habitat but also a habitat for them</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:39.920" style="s2">as well so thinking about habitat being</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.679" end="01:14:41.360" style="s2">not just for other species but for all</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.920" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">species including us</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.360" end="01:14:45.040" style="s2">and and i think we also need to start to</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:48.640" style="s2">think of our cities</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.040" end="01:14:49.360" style="s2">as habitats for all species not just for</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.640" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">humans so</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.360" end="01:14:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s expanding it both ways i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:54.560" style="s2">that we really need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.120" end="01:14:56.159" style="s2">shift our thinking about that because</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.560" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">that you know our planning system is</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.159" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:00.960" style="s2">people there nature there and farming</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">there and this is what i really like</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.960" end="01:15:03.600" style="s2">about permaculture is it kind of brings</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.640" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.600" end="01:15:06.480" style="s2">back together again and saying well how</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.120" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">can we bring more people into the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.480" end="01:15:10.880" style="s2">farming landscapes and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">bring you know forests and natchez</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.880" end="01:15:14.719" style="s2">nature spaces back into farms and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:16.640" style="s2">into the urban areas and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.719" end="01:15:19.760" style="s2">actually condense our footprint</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.640" end="01:15:22.960" style="s2">of of you know what we need for</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.760" end="01:15:25.040" style="s2">for living well uh so that we can create</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.960" end="01:15:25.920" style="s2">more space it&#39;s available for nature to</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.040" end="01:15:29.199" style="s2">thrive</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.920" end="01:15:31.120" style="s2">um and you know it&#39;s part of that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.199" end="01:15:32.800" style="s2">rewilding but rewiring</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.120" end="01:15:34.560" style="s2">differently i think it&#39;s not with that</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.800" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">sense of just locking it away</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.560" end="01:15:38.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually about just that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:40.800" style="s2">the ecological systems regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.800" end="01:15:42.560" style="s2">which is absolutely critical because</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.800" end="01:15:43.840" style="s2">you know a lot of the a lot of what we</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.560" end="01:15:46.320" style="s2">understand about why we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.840" end="01:15:48.320" style="s2">situation we are now is because of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.320" end="01:15:50.400" style="s2">ecosystems breakdown and then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.320" end="01:15:51.360" style="s2">until we start to restore our ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.400" end="01:15:53.520" style="s2">that will</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.360" end="01:15:55.120" style="s2">start to avert more of these kind of</p>

<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:04.000" style="s2">because you know the way that the um</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.840" end="01:16:05.440" style="s2">ecosystem has been so destroyed and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.000" end="01:16:08.080" style="s2">know forest destroyed and</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.080" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">we&#39;re actually getting this situation</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.600" end="01:16:14.719" style="s2">where you know bushfires</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:16.880" style="s2">just take off so you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.719" end="01:16:18.960" style="s2">it&#39;s all tied together as you know as</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.880" end="01:16:20.880" style="s2">frichoff talks about you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.960" end="01:16:22.640" style="s2">the multiple crises but it&#39;s all you</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.880" end="01:16:25.679" style="s2">know it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.640" end="01:16:28.159" style="s2">how we perceive it and if we can</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.679" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">make a shift in perception and and what</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.159" end="01:16:32.960" style="s2">nora bateson talks about too is</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.000" end="01:16:34.880" style="s2">she&#39;s sort of saying that um you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.960" end="01:16:37.040" style="s2">her warm data labs is about bringing</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.880" end="01:16:39.120" style="s2">people together in conversations to uns</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.040" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">to make sense of things from different</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.120" end="01:16:41.520" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:43.520" style="s2">and she said actually the shift in</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.520" end="01:16:45.760" style="s2">perception is action</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.520" end="01:16:47.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not leading to an action that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.760" end="01:16:49.199" style="s2">do this the perception shift is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.760" end="01:16:51.760" style="s2">action that needs to take and</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.199" end="01:16:53.199" style="s2">and we were i had a was hosting a warmed</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.760" end="01:16:54.320" style="s2">outer lab the other day with a group of</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.199" end="01:16:56.960" style="s2">people who sort of run</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.320" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">various sorts of amazing programs</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.960" end="01:16:59.920" style="s2">throughout australia and they were</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:01.520" style="s2">saying at all the events that they go to</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.920" end="01:17:04.000" style="s2">there&#39;s never enough space for</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.520" end="01:17:05.520" style="s2">for play or dance or music it&#39;s all very</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">serious and earnest stuff and you come</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.520" end="01:17:08.239" style="s2">away feeling completely depleted because</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.600" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.239" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">so head-based whereas we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:15.040" style="s2">reflecting on when there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:16.000" style="s2">some kind of something that was more</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.040" end="01:17:18.159" style="s2">playful</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.000" end="01:17:19.280" style="s2">or enabled you to get sort of more in</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.159" end="01:17:21.679" style="s2">your body not</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.280" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">artificially created so it felt awkward</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.679" end="01:17:24.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:26.480" style="s2">just to be relaxed and to kind of take</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.640" end="01:17:27.760" style="s2">it on that&#39;s where the sense making</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.480" end="01:17:30.159" style="s2">start to happen that&#39;s when those</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.760" end="01:17:32.320" style="s2">connections start to happen that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.159" end="01:17:34.080" style="s2">it it landed and so we all started</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.320" end="01:17:37.520" style="s2">talking about how we wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.080" end="01:17:40.080" style="s2">integrate a lot more i don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.520" end="01:17:42.080" style="s2">playfulness into our into our</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.080" end="01:17:44.080" style="s2">conversations and into our</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.080" end="01:17:46.000" style="s2">and my children always tell me all the</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.080" end="01:17:48.719" style="s2">time that i&#39;m i&#39;m not funny at all</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.000" end="01:17:50.080" style="s2">i&#39;m just i&#39;m just actually quite boring</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.719" end="01:17:52.080" style="s2">really i&#39;m always talking about</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.080" end="01:17:55.120" style="s2">serious stuff and and i&#39;m always too</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.080" end="01:17:59.360" style="s2">earnest and maybe it&#39;s time to actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.120" end="01:18:00.800" style="s2">you know relax a bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.360" end="01:18:03.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s not interesting there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">integration thing because</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:06.480" style="s2">it is fun and play and it is also rigor</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.480" end="01:18:10.159" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:13.120" style="s2">be fun like i find</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.159" end="01:18:14.080" style="s2">that i&#39;ve always said that the the real</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.120" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">contribution</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.080" end="01:18:18.320" style="s2">of the guy education curriculum eco</p>

<p begin="01:18:21.920" end="01:18:27.040" style="s2">world sort of piece together this</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.679" end="01:18:30.640" style="s2">this this mosaic of of a map</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:33.360" style="s2">that um is</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.640" end="01:18:35.280" style="s2">for to me is a map of integration it is</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.360" end="01:18:38.719" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.280" end="01:18:40.640" style="s2">um doing something very similar than the</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.719" end="01:18:42.880" style="s2">warm data lab and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.640" end="01:18:44.480" style="s2">that because that was the last thing i</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.880" end="01:18:45.760" style="s2">also wanted to talk about with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.480" end="01:18:48.159" style="s2">permaculture is that</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.760" end="01:18:49.360" style="s2">for so many people permaculture for so</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.159" end="01:18:51.199" style="s2">long has been this</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.360" end="01:18:52.840" style="s2">this kind of more like this is a new way</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.199" end="01:18:56.159" style="s2">to to grow food</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.840" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">um system and while it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.159" end="01:18:59.760" style="s2">always been a much wider kind of how do</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:02.880" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.760" end="01:19:06.000" style="s2">how do we fit in how do we become um</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.880" end="01:19:07.440" style="s2">custodian inhabitants of land and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.000" end="01:19:09.440" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.440" end="01:19:11.440" style="s2">keystone species in the land that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.440" end="01:19:14.480" style="s2">inhabit in ways that we draw</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.440" end="01:19:16.320" style="s2">um from the land in such a way that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.480" end="01:19:20.080" style="s2">actually give back more than we draw</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.320" end="01:19:22.400" style="s2">um i i i&#39;m completely with you that if</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.080" end="01:19:25.280" style="s2">permaculture is that bigger thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:27.040" style="s2">yeah but what i&#39;ve noticed with with the</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.280" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">eco village design education curriculum</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.040" end="01:19:28.880" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.600" end="01:19:30.719" style="s2">you get all these people come in they</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.880" end="01:19:32.000" style="s2">come in through the permaculture route</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.719" end="01:19:34.560" style="s2">or they come in through the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.000" end="01:19:36.960" style="s2">non violent communication and</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.560" end="01:19:38.400" style="s2">facilitation and the human process the</p>

<p begin="01:19:41.679" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">and local um economy work um</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.040" end="01:19:48.640" style="s2">or they they come in from a more</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:50.880" style="s2">philosophical kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.640" end="01:19:52.719" style="s2">no it&#39;s all about the cartesian split</p>

<p begin="01:19:57.440" end="01:20:01.120" style="s2">all of those perspectives are needed and</p>

<p begin="01:20:01.120" end="01:20:05.120" style="s2">do this course whether it&#39;s the kind of</p>

<p begin="01:20:15.440" end="01:20:19.360" style="s2">combining it with a perma pvc and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.000" end="01:20:22.320" style="s2">doing it over three months</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:23.520" style="s2">must have been a wonderful program um</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.320" end="01:20:26.159" style="s2">what it does for people</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.520" end="01:20:27.920" style="s2">is that it values these different entry</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.159" end="01:20:29.520" style="s2">points in in different ways and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.920" end="01:20:32.000" style="s2">they suddenly see that</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.520" end="01:20:34.159" style="s2">that all of them matter like i i</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.000" end="01:20:36.480" style="s2">remember when i first</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.159" end="01:20:37.920" style="s2">25 years ago wanted to set up an eco</p>

<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:49.360" style="s2">um and and permaculture and the kind of</p>

<p begin="01:20:49.360" end="01:20:55.040" style="s2">like food self-sufficiency um</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.120" end="01:20:56.800" style="s2">it was about of course because it was in</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.040" end="01:20:58.639" style="s2">southern spain it was about water and</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.800" end="01:21:00.639" style="s2">how to manage water on the land but</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.639" end="01:21:01.760" style="s2">i was absolutely oblivious about</p>

<p begin="01:27:26.800" end="01:27:31.360" style="s2">important because they are</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.320" end="01:27:34.239" style="s2">somehow subtle signs of</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.360" end="01:27:35.440" style="s2">something is happening and and and if we</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.239" end="01:27:38.560" style="s2">listen to them</p>

<p begin="01:27:45.600" end="01:27:49.440" style="s2">people around the world if you walk</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.360" end="01:27:51.360" style="s2">through the forest and in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.440" end="01:27:53.199" style="s2">and the dew drops are still hanging on</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.360" end="01:27:54.880" style="s2">the leaves and the sunlight</p>

<p begin="01:27:54.880" end="01:27:59.600" style="s2">little fairy diamond sparkling</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.360" end="01:28:00.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not just oh yeah some physical</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.600" end="01:28:02.960" style="s2">explanation</p>

<p begin="01:28:07.920" end="01:28:11.679" style="s2">self is speaking to us through these</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.320" end="01:28:14.719" style="s2">moments</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.679" end="01:28:16.159" style="s2">and and i i think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.719" end="01:28:18.000" style="s2">also what you were saying like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.159" end="01:28:20.080" style="s2">this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.000" end="01:28:22.480" style="s2">entering into the flow and then suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.080" end="01:28:25.679" style="s2">energy like you can just</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.480" end="01:28:28.239" style="s2">um get stuff done like</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.679" end="01:28:28.800" style="s2">a week&#39;s work worth of work suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.239" end="01:28:31.600" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.800" end="01:28:33.840" style="s2">in a seven hour run where you kind of go</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.600" end="01:28:38.159" style="s2">oh wow i certainly got into</p>

<p begin="01:28:38.159" end="01:28:41.520" style="s2">and and it&#39;s important to also do the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.080" end="01:28:43.840" style="s2">exact opposite to</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.520" end="01:28:46.000" style="s2">when when there is when it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.840" end="01:28:47.760" style="s2">right to push to just say okay</p>

<p begin="01:29:58.000" end="01:30:00.800" style="s2">remember when i was a kid and because</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.440" end="01:30:02.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the place we always i</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.800" end="01:30:04.320" style="s2">always went from the city to there that</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.320" end="01:30:06.960" style="s2">was it that was my life very local</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.320" end="01:30:08.400" style="s2">and when i was when i was had to leave</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.960" end="01:30:11.120" style="s2">there after the holidays</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.400" end="01:30:12.719" style="s2">and go back to the city i would listen</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.120" end="01:30:14.639" style="s2">to the cars in the distance and i would</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.719" end="01:30:15.760" style="s2">imagine it was the ocean crashing on the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.639" end="01:30:18.159" style="s2">beach and i would</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.760" end="01:30:19.040" style="s2">and i would um if i was sort of feeling</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.159" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">like a bit</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.040" end="01:30:22.400" style="s2">stuck in the city i closed my eyes and i</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:25.520" style="s2">could imagine myself just</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.400" end="01:30:26.320" style="s2">walking along these little bush ways and</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.520" end="01:30:28.159" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.320" end="01:30:30.320" style="s2">it&#39;s those little spaces they stay</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.159" end="01:30:31.920" style="s2">within you and i think if you find those</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.320" end="01:30:33.840" style="s2">special places that they are those</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.920" end="01:30:36.719" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.840" end="01:30:37.280" style="s2">sources of energy and connection and you</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.719" end="01:30:40.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.280" end="01:30:42.719" style="s2">we we don&#39;t have indigenous routes that</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.320" end="01:30:45.840" style="s2">go 120 000 years</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.719" end="01:30:46.560" style="s2">of into this country here but we can</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.840" end="01:30:48.639" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.560" end="01:30:49.840" style="s2">and connect with those special places</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.639" end="01:30:51.840" style="s2">and we can really</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.840" end="01:30:53.360" style="s2">and i think the more that we start to to</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.840" end="01:30:56.000" style="s2">ground and listen and be</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.360" end="01:30:57.520" style="s2">and and spend time with local elders as</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.000" end="01:31:00.400" style="s2">well and understanding</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.520" end="01:31:02.000" style="s2">a little bit about the depth of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.400" end="01:31:05.679" style="s2">place and and what it means</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.000" end="01:31:05.679" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.159" end="01:31:11.840" style="s2">it it feels different than just</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.280" end="01:31:12.639" style="s2">living in a place it&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.840" end="01:31:14.800" style="s2">different way of</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.639" end="01:31:17.679" style="s2">being in the landscape i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.800" end="01:31:20.800" style="s2">really important to</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.679" end="01:31:24.320" style="s2">in a sort of both and way</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.800" end="01:31:26.960" style="s2">to on the one hand not pretend like</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.320" end="01:31:28.639" style="s2">are we disconnected westerners we can</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.960" end="01:31:30.719" style="s2">just say oh we&#39;re all indigenous to</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.639" end="01:31:33.280" style="s2">planet earth and then then we</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.719" end="01:31:34.080" style="s2">we&#39;re equal or we have the ancestral</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.280" end="01:31:38.080" style="s2">knowledge that</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.080" end="01:31:39.760" style="s2">that um indigenous people hold and</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.080" end="01:31:41.199" style="s2">the other end of the spectrum to say we</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.760" end="01:31:43.600" style="s2">will never get there because we</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.199" end="01:31:44.239" style="s2">never grew up in in this and and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.600" end="01:31:46.719" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.239" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve got it all wrong and and now</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.719" end="01:31:51.280" style="s2">suddenly it&#39;s it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:52.960" style="s2">turned over to only people who can claim</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.280" end="01:31:55.280" style="s2">some form of indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.960" end="01:31:56.000" style="s2">lineage which has also been in so many</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.280" end="01:32:00.239" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.000" end="01:32:03.760" style="s2">um submitted to 400 years</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.239" end="01:32:04.080" style="s2">of um torture and and and destruction</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.760" end="01:32:07.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.080" end="01:32:09.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.600" end="01:32:11.120" style="s2">um knowledge and wisdom any more than it</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.760" end="01:32:15.199" style="s2">was 400 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.120" end="01:32:18.159" style="s2">um so so i i think we do need to reclaim</p>

<p begin="01:34:25.840" end="01:34:30.719" style="s2">when we when we talk with young people</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.000" end="01:34:33.840" style="s2">about these things and when we engage</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.719" end="01:34:36.080" style="s2">them in this that</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.840" end="01:34:38.719" style="s2">they grow up within this space there is</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.080" end="01:34:41.040" style="s2">a deep sense of</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.719" end="01:34:43.040" style="s2">like a groundedness and a peacefulness</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.040" end="01:34:45.040" style="s2">within them i think because</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.040" end="01:34:46.400" style="s2">you know when we when we&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.040" end="01:34:48.080" style="s2">urbanized</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.400" end="01:34:49.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t seem to have that unless we</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.080" end="01:34:51.520" style="s2">have that conversation unless we have</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.920" end="01:34:55.040" style="s2">those experiences</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.520" end="01:34:58.000" style="s2">we can just feel completely separated</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.040" end="01:34:58.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s such an important thing to to</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.000" end="01:35:00.239" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.719" end="01:35:01.920" style="s2">to do this work and to have those</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.239" end="01:35:05.280" style="s2">conversations and to</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.920" end="01:35:07.360" style="s2">to engage um young people in that i</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.280" end="01:35:08.800" style="s2">was so excited last night i was on a</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.360" end="01:35:11.199" style="s2">conversation with them</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.800" end="01:35:12.239" style="s2">with the the gen ambassadors from the</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.199" end="01:35:15.440" style="s2">oceana region</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.239" end="01:35:18.480" style="s2">and one of them was an education uh</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.440" end="01:35:19.760" style="s2">officer from bhutan and he was just</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.480" end="01:35:23.199" style="s2">talking about how</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.760" end="01:35:25.920" style="s2">they&#39;re developing up the k-12 uh</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.199" end="01:35:27.520" style="s2">permaculture and eco-village principles</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.920" end="01:35:29.199" style="s2">embedding within their whole</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.520" end="01:35:30.639" style="s2">way of life and talking about you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.199" end="01:35:33.880" style="s2">very place based</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.639" end="01:35:38.560" style="s2">education and i was just thinking if if</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.880" end="01:35:41.360" style="s2">regeneration and deep place</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.560" end="01:35:43.600" style="s2">thinking is embodied within the school</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.360" end="01:35:44.159" style="s2">and things emerge from that as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.600" end="01:35:45.600" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.159" end="01:35:47.760" style="s2">the kind of values that we have at the</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.600" end="01:35:49.360" style="s2">moment i mean i know a lot of this can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.760" end="01:35:51.119" style="s2">be taught at schools it&#39;s about what</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.360" end="01:35:52.719" style="s2">happens in those conversations in the in</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.119" end="01:35:54.880" style="s2">between times but i still think if we</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.719" end="01:35:56.880" style="s2">can start to flip</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.880" end="01:35:58.400" style="s2">where are education systems coming from</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.880" end="01:36:00.320" style="s2">and where those conversations that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.400" end="01:36:02.320" style="s2">having with young people and</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.320" end="01:36:04.000" style="s2">and to raise the bar you know i think a</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.320" end="01:36:06.159" style="s2">lot of the conversations that i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.000" end="01:36:08.480" style="s2">with young people are</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.159" end="01:36:10.159" style="s2">not at that deep level whereas the the</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.480" end="01:36:12.639" style="s2">depth of understanding like i</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.159" end="01:36:14.239" style="s2">i&#39;m always amazed you know when you have</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.639" end="01:36:14.800" style="s2">those conversations with young people</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.239" end="01:36:18.320" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.800" end="01:36:20.320" style="s2">deeply they take it in and how much</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.320" end="01:36:22.159" style="s2">it stays with them and like you said it</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.320" end="01:36:23.600" style="s2">comes out a couple of weeks later and</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.159" end="01:36:24.159" style="s2">you can see that it&#39;s been rolling</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.600" end="01:36:27.520" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.159" end="01:36:29.679" style="s2">in there and it&#39;s it&#39;s really stuck</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.520" end="01:36:31.199" style="s2">and uh i think i think those</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.679" end="01:36:35.199" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.199" end="01:36:37.199" style="s2">are just absolutely just priceless</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.199" end="01:36:40.000" style="s2">and we need to be having them with each</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.199" end="01:36:42.560" style="s2">other as well as our young people</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.000" end="01:36:43.920" style="s2">well one thing that as you were</p>

<p begin="01:37:15.840" end="01:37:24.080" style="s2">the baggage um as a as a declaration</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.480" end="01:37:27.199" style="s2">and a invocation</p>

<p begin="01:40:29.360" end="01:40:34.320" style="s2">he&#39;s more of a theoretician and i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.760" end="01:40:37.600" style="s2">practitioner or the other way around</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.320" end="01:40:42.400" style="s2">both and um the the power</p>

<p begin="01:40:42.400" end="01:40:46.719" style="s2">meaning and storytelling that helps</p>

<p begin="01:41:00.400" end="01:41:02.719" style="s2">just to remind people of that little</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.239" end="01:41:04.719" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.719" end="01:41:06.560" style="s2">sounds like theory but if it lands in</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.719" end="01:41:08.960" style="s2">the person in the right moment</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.560" end="01:41:09.600" style="s2">it changes the trajectory of that person</p>

<p begin="01:41:09.600" end="01:41:13.280" style="s2">and who could say that that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.920" end="01:41:16.159" style="s2">practical</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.280" end="01:41:17.199" style="s2">and and so um and i&#39;m totally practical</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.159" end="01:41:20.000" style="s2">i mean how</p>

<p begin="01:41:26.159" end="01:41:32.159" style="s2">um a week of people</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.600" end="01:41:32.719" style="s2">who somehow find what i&#39;m putting out</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.159" end="01:41:35.040" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.719" end="01:41:35.760" style="s2">um meaningful and then telling stories</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.040" end="01:41:38.320" style="s2">that are so</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.760" end="01:41:38.880" style="s2">touching that that every time i i feel</p>

<p begin="01:41:42.080" end="01:41:46.080" style="s2">and finally pay more attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.639" end="01:41:49.360" style="s2">things that i&#39;ve been putting off</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.080" end="01:41:51.119" style="s2">for a while um in in my immediate</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.360" end="01:41:52.719" style="s2">chain living situation change like to</p>

<p begin="01:41:57.679" end="01:42:00.800" style="s2">village community and</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.119" end="01:42:03.040" style="s2">and a garden like the one that you can</p>

<p begin="01:42:03.040" end="01:42:07.280" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s really where i feel</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.000" end="01:42:10.960" style="s2">pulled that i need to</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.280" end="01:42:14.159" style="s2">kind of pay attention to that base</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.960" end="01:42:16.239" style="s2">for me for a while um but it&#39;s i find it</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.159" end="01:42:17.840" style="s2">really encouraging to see how how many</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.239" end="01:42:20.639" style="s2">people actually do get</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.840" end="01:42:22.480" style="s2">something out of conversations such as</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.639" end="01:42:26.800" style="s2">this do you also get a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.480" end="01:42:29.600" style="s2">um absolutely you know i think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.800" end="01:42:29.920" style="s2">often they might feel alone where they</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.600" end="01:42:32.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.920" end="01:42:34.400" style="s2">and that connecting in with these this</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.400" end="01:42:36.000" style="s2">global conversation and feeling a sense</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.400" end="01:42:38.080" style="s2">of resonance with it</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.000" end="01:42:39.760" style="s2">um just makes them feel like they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.080" end="01:42:42.159" style="s2">a sense of coming home</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.760" end="01:42:43.760" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s other people who</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.159" end="01:42:45.600" style="s2">think like them and you know like from</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.760" end="01:42:47.679" style="s2">just from that simple kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.600" end="01:42:49.040" style="s2">perspective those i get those sort of</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.679" end="01:42:52.159" style="s2">comments all the time</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.040" end="01:42:53.840" style="s2">um another one is a sense of permission</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.159" end="01:42:55.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not like we&#39;re saying okay</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.840" end="01:42:56.960" style="s2">you can go out and do that but</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.280" end="01:42:59.280" style="s2">there is this sense of opening oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.960" end="01:43:01.119" style="s2">it&#39;s actually okay to think like that to</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.280" end="01:43:03.920" style="s2">act like that to do that or</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.119" end="01:43:05.280" style="s2">um to go ahead and yeah the stories i</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.920" end="01:43:07.199" style="s2">get from all over but</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.280" end="01:43:08.400" style="s2">you know the story that i&#39;m also getting</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.199" end="01:43:11.119" style="s2">lots of um</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.400" end="01:43:12.239" style="s2">requests at the moment particularly from</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.119" end="01:43:14.719" style="s2">uh different groups</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.239" end="01:43:15.520" style="s2">in in refugee camps because that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.719" end="01:43:17.600" style="s2">of the rippling</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.520" end="01:43:19.119" style="s2">that&#39;s going out and saying i&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.600" end="01:43:20.560" style="s2">the amazing work that this group is</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.119" end="01:43:22.400" style="s2">doing and they&#39;ve told me about</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.560" end="01:43:23.679" style="s2">how what that&#39;s happening and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.400" end="01:43:27.199" style="s2">rippling out</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.679" end="01:43:29.040" style="s2">and so i get this sense that</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.199" end="01:43:31.119" style="s2">once it goes out there&#39;s this life that</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.040" end="01:43:32.719" style="s2">it has and it keeps going and so even in</p>

<p begin="01:43:36.560" end="01:43:41.600" style="s2">the impact that it has and um it comes</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.920" end="01:43:43.920" style="s2">back maybe 20 years later i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.600" end="01:43:47.199" style="s2">people coming up to me and saying</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.920" end="01:43:49.840" style="s2">i came into a workshop that you did um</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.199" end="01:43:52.080" style="s2">you know at a library it&#39;s like 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.840" end="01:43:53.920" style="s2">ago or something and you said this</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.080" end="01:43:55.199" style="s2">and and then i went off and i did this</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.920" end="01:43:55.520" style="s2">and this and this and this and this and</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.199" end="01:43:58.080" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:43:58.080" end="01:44:02.159" style="s2">me think is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.960" end="01:44:02.960" style="s2">everything that i say and every idea</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.159" end="01:44:06.000" style="s2">that i share</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.960" end="01:44:09.840" style="s2">and and how i share it is</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.000" end="01:44:13.040" style="s2">important because it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.840" end="01:44:16.080" style="s2">all of those things have impact</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.040" end="01:44:19.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the words it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.080" end="01:44:22.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all of that and i so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.440" end="01:44:23.520" style="s2">always really conscious about the types</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.000" end="01:44:24.560" style="s2">of stories that i&#39;m sharing the type of</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.520" end="01:44:26.639" style="s2">language that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.560" end="01:44:28.400" style="s2">using and the type of way that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.639" end="01:44:29.920" style="s2">offering and inviting people to</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.400" end="01:44:33.440" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.920" end="01:44:37.040" style="s2">in in that and and providing</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.440" end="01:44:37.920" style="s2">opportunities for not just activating an</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.040" end="01:44:40.400" style="s2">idea but</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.920" end="01:44:41.600" style="s2">finding an avenue to then take the next</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.400" end="01:44:43.600" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.600" end="01:44:46.239" style="s2">maybe gently to start with you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.600" end="01:44:48.880" style="s2">just finished this series</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.239" end="01:44:50.480" style="s2">on plastic free july so we&#39;re at the end</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.880" end="01:44:52.560" style="s2">today is the very end of plastic free</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.480" end="01:44:55.040" style="s2">july so every day through</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.560" end="01:44:56.639" style="s2">through july i would just head outside</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.040" end="01:44:58.080" style="s2">into my garden or into my</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.639" end="01:44:59.920" style="s2">kitchen or somewhere around the house</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.080" end="01:45:00.560" style="s2">and start talking about different ways</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.920" end="01:45:03.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.560" end="01:45:05.440" style="s2">think about you know cooking and</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.520" end="01:45:08.480" style="s2">gardening and cleaning and it was like</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.440" end="01:45:10.000" style="s2">such micro little tips but it became</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.480" end="01:45:12.400" style="s2">you know the thing is when you find a</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.000" end="01:45:13.199" style="s2">little point to enter into it opens up a</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.400" end="01:45:14.639" style="s2">whole world</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.199" end="01:45:16.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s like what is</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.639" end="01:45:18.560" style="s2">that point of accessibility</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.560" end="01:45:20.159" style="s2">that i can talk to you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.560" end="01:45:22.000" style="s2">threatening it&#39;s not overwhelming it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.159" end="01:45:22.560" style="s2">just i&#39;m talking to you person to person</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.000" end="01:45:25.360" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.560" end="01:45:27.199" style="s2">something you go oh yeah i could do that</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.360" end="01:45:29.040" style="s2">but then realizing that by doing that</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.199" end="01:45:30.639" style="s2">it&#39;s starting to shift the way you see</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.040" end="01:45:32.159" style="s2">it&#39;s done to shift your perception start</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.639" end="01:45:32.639" style="s2">to shift the way you act the way you</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.159" end="01:45:34.560" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.639" end="01:45:36.639" style="s2">the way that you purchase the way you</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.560" end="01:45:37.040" style="s2">speak up that you know once you start to</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.639" end="01:45:39.440" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.040" end="01:45:41.040" style="s2">up the way that you see things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.440" end="01:45:42.000" style="s2">really difficult to close back down</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.040" end="01:45:44.320" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.000" end="01:45:45.199" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t have to be a major shift</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.320" end="01:45:47.840" style="s2">that happens and</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.199" end="01:45:49.199" style="s2">often it&#39;s those little things that can</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.840" end="01:45:51.040" style="s2">spark</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.199" end="01:45:52.800" style="s2">and also that it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.040" end="01:45:54.400" style="s2">accessibility i think</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.800" end="01:45:56.000" style="s2">for me that i&#39;ve come down to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.400" end="01:45:58.080" style="s2">the a lot of the work that i&#39;ve end up</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.000" end="01:46:00.880" style="s2">doing with communities in</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.080" end="01:46:02.000" style="s2">uh in schools and with children and with</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.880" end="01:46:03.760" style="s2">teenagers and</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.000" end="01:46:05.360" style="s2">and even with you know in senior</p>

<p begin="01:46:05.360" end="01:46:08.960" style="s2">of you know valuing every person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.920" end="01:46:12.239" style="s2">contribution</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.960" end="01:46:15.040" style="s2">house however big or small it is</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.239" end="01:46:15.600" style="s2">that you know say if i&#39;m going to talk i</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.040" end="01:46:17.760" style="s2">can get</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.600" end="01:46:19.520" style="s2">invited to talk at local libraries for</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.760" end="01:46:20.800" style="s2">example and i go in and i</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.520" end="01:46:23.119" style="s2">and i look around and i might be</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.800" end="01:46:24.080" style="s2">surrounded by a city of people and the</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.119" end="01:46:27.040" style="s2">average age</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.080" end="01:46:28.880" style="s2">would be maybe 70. and i think oh this</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.040" end="01:46:32.639" style="s2">is really interesting and then i start</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.880" end="01:46:33.440" style="s2">then afterwards they say oh my son he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.639" end="01:46:35.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.440" end="01:46:37.280" style="s2">head of the architecture thing of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.679" end="01:46:39.119" style="s2">university of such and such i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.280" end="01:46:40.960" style="s2">tell him about that and then</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.119" end="01:46:42.960" style="s2">it says you know my granddaughter is</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.960" end="01:46:44.480" style="s2">that and they and the communication</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.960" end="01:46:47.360" style="s2">starts to ripple out and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.480" end="01:46:49.040" style="s2">totally never going to judge oh this is</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.360" end="01:46:49.360" style="s2">not going to go very far because you</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.040" end="01:46:52.080" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.360" end="01:46:53.040" style="s2">everyone&#39;s perspective and everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.080" end="01:46:55.920" style="s2">there because they</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.040" end="01:46:57.199" style="s2">absolutely are drawn to being in that</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.920" end="01:47:02.159" style="s2">point and that</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.199" end="01:47:05.119" style="s2">um you know i don&#39;t know something about</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.159" end="01:47:06.719" style="s2">i have this i have this struggle quite</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.119" end="01:47:09.119" style="s2">often thinking oh it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.719" end="01:47:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not enough i&#39;m not doing enough</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.119" end="01:47:12.960" style="s2">by doing that small thing but then i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.960" end="01:47:14.880" style="s2">got to remind myself about how</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.960" end="01:47:16.000" style="s2">you know that how everything&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.880" end="01:47:18.480" style="s2">and if it&#39;s a gentle</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.000" end="01:47:21.199" style="s2">and a beautiful way of offering and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.480" end="01:47:23.280" style="s2">taken up and gently and beautifully</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.199" end="01:47:24.960" style="s2">um passed forward because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.280" end="01:47:26.639" style="s2">things that i&#39;ve struggled with right</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.960" end="01:47:28.719" style="s2">from when i first started becoming an</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.639" end="01:47:31.520" style="s2">activist when i was in my teenage was</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.719" end="01:47:32.560" style="s2">you know the violence in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.520" end="01:47:35.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.560" end="01:47:38.239" style="s2">and the and the conflict and it really</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.679" end="01:47:40.000" style="s2">you know whenever i come to that space i</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.239" end="01:47:43.040" style="s2">feel incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.000" end="01:47:44.400" style="s2">i know it upsets me really deeply and so</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.040" end="01:47:45.920" style="s2">the the way in which i</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.400" end="01:47:48.000" style="s2">would like to be in the world is not</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.920" end="01:47:49.119" style="s2">about confronting things and doing this</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.000" end="01:47:51.440" style="s2">sort of face off</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.119" end="01:47:53.280" style="s2">about you should be doing that or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.440" end="01:47:55.520" style="s2">wrong or you know stop that it</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.280" end="01:47:57.119" style="s2">it is about an invitation it&#39;s about an</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.520" end="01:47:59.760" style="s2">opening it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.119" end="01:48:01.440" style="s2">coming into the joy of being in this</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.760" end="01:48:02.239" style="s2">sort of regeneration in a really</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.440" end="01:48:04.880" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.239" end="01:48:05.679" style="s2">way and um and that&#39;s just that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.880" end="01:48:08.080" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.679" end="01:48:09.679" style="s2">how i&#39;ve found my place in which i can</p>

<p begin="01:48:09.679" end="01:48:13.679" style="s2">and that i can invite people on the</p>

<p begin="01:48:22.000" end="01:48:25.840" style="s2">um asking the question what do i</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.080" end="01:48:29.040" style="s2">activate with the power of my</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.840" end="01:48:31.760" style="s2">attention and intention and and</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.040" end="01:48:32.880" style="s2">so much more transformative to activate</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.760" end="01:48:35.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.880" end="01:48:36.400" style="s2">the transformational regenerative story</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.040" end="01:48:39.440" style="s2">rather than to</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.400" end="01:48:42.719" style="s2">to um fight</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.440" end="01:48:44.800" style="s2">uh the destruction and i mean gianna</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.719" end="01:48:46.800" style="s2">macy&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.800" end="01:48:48.320" style="s2">clearly named the three areas like</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.800" end="01:48:49.840" style="s2">holding actions</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.320" end="01:48:52.320" style="s2">seeing within your eyes and and building</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.840" end="01:48:55.199" style="s2">new systems they&#39;re all important but</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.320" end="01:48:56.880" style="s2">but i think we need to find our our</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.199" end="01:48:59.760" style="s2">resonance</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.880" end="01:49:00.080" style="s2">with who we are called to be and and i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:49:00.080" end="01:49:03.760" style="s2">definitely more activating the the</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.840" end="01:49:06.080" style="s2">positive rather than fighting</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.760" end="01:49:06.800" style="s2">the the negative but how do you deal</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.080" end="01:49:08.719" style="s2">with and</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.800" end="01:49:10.400" style="s2">this we should probably come to a close</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.719" end="01:49:13.280" style="s2">but as you were saying that</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.400" end="01:49:14.880" style="s2">now more refugee camps reach out to you</p>
