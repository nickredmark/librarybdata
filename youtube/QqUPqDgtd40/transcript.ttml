<p begin="00:00:07.630" end="00:00:15.769" style="s2">so funny how that happens funny how that</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.740" end="00:00:17.600" style="s2">happens you know and then I I want to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.769" end="00:00:23.320" style="s2">back to what I wrote because I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.600" end="00:00:23.320" style="s2">thinking and I don&#39;t know if Matias was</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.460" end="00:00:30.680" style="s2">was was responding to my poster he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.220" end="00:00:36.040" style="s2">posting something else but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.680" end="00:00:41.000" style="s2">realized that cohesion coherence</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.040" end="00:00:45.530" style="s2">distinction is one that is so often</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.000" end="00:00:50.840" style="s2">missed and and it isn&#39;t that cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.530" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t useful or valuable but but that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.840" end="00:00:59.079" style="s2">was so much of the learning of of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:01:01.610" style="s2">symposium and in that period of time</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.079" end="00:01:07.130" style="s2">yeah and I think what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.610" end="00:01:09.979" style="s2">you see the broad range of cultures the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.130" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">Tooth the de to the spectrum of cultures</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.979" end="00:01:14.060" style="s2">that we have that we&#39;re working with so</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:16.550" style="s2">on the one hand you have the legacy</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.060" end="00:01:18.350" style="s2">corporations the legacy organizations</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.550" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">where there&#39;s too much individual</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.350" end="00:01:21.979" style="s2">contribution there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:25.399" style="s2">competition and they don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.979" end="00:01:28.069" style="s2">build teens right and so they have you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.399" end="00:01:31.399" style="s2">know so agile comes along and they make</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.069" end="00:01:33.470" style="s2">everything team based team centered and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.399" end="00:01:37.399" style="s2">they create these really cool teams that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.470" end="00:01:41.380" style="s2">are very cohesive and then the unit that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.399" end="00:01:45.229" style="s2">it&#39;s protected is the team right and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.380" end="00:01:49.910" style="s2">this sense is being improvement maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.229" end="00:01:52.429" style="s2">its not an improvement but this middle</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.910" end="00:01:54.319" style="s2">range this notion of coherence is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.429" end="00:01:59.170" style="s2">ability to move in and out of what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.319" end="00:02:01.970" style="s2">call locations and settle into a team</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.170" end="00:02:06.940" style="s2">interaction as quickly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.970" end="00:02:09.170" style="s2">without then creating a team that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.940" end="00:02:11.330" style="s2">protective and then you get the politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.170" end="00:02:14.840" style="s2">of inclusion and exclusion new people</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.330" end="00:02:17.239" style="s2">can&#39;t quite get on board and you know so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">this is something that general</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.239" end="00:02:20.290" style="s2">McChrystal about in his book team of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:22.900" style="s2">teams</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.290" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">as they knew how to have hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.900" end="00:02:28.450" style="s2">chain of commands and they knew how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:32.590" style="s2">create these great teams like the seals</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.450" end="00:02:38.019" style="s2">right these SWAT teams and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.590" end="00:02:42.849" style="s2">about what had to uh all the different</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.019" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">things that had to be emplaced for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.849" end="00:02:48.939" style="s2">seal team that saved that captain from</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:51.250" style="s2">those pirates you know it was a movie</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.939" end="00:02:55.540" style="s2">made by Tom Hanks right and they had</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.250" end="00:02:57.400" style="s2">they had to execute five shots all at</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.540" end="00:03:00.849" style="s2">the same time with two boats going up</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.400" end="00:03:03.959" style="s2">and down in people moving in or else if</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.849" end="00:03:06.639" style="s2">one person had been left alive they they</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.959" end="00:03:10.870" style="s2">would have killed Tom Hanks you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.639" end="00:03:13.269" style="s2">so he talked about how they experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.870" end="00:03:15.939" style="s2">that is one organism so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.269" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">deep cohesion right but it also in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.939" end="00:03:22.060" style="s2">book talks about how those teams can</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:25.569" style="s2">never get along with other teams you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.060" end="00:03:28.389" style="s2">know right right and and that so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.569" end="00:03:30.430" style="s2">unit of the bounded unit becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.389" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">team so that could be better but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.430" end="00:03:37.150" style="s2">still a bounded unit so we try to look</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:39.400" style="s2">at that and look at the politics of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.150" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">inclusion and exclusion and say we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.400" end="00:03:44.260" style="s2">even do better than that so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:47.620" style="s2">big reason why we moved to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.260" end="00:03:49.659" style="s2">location and it could be that you you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:52.690" style="s2">know a team is a location and you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.659" end="00:03:56.199" style="s2">have just a very cohesive team as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.690" end="00:03:58.329" style="s2">location but ideally you have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.199" end="00:04:01.359" style="s2">different locations and people self</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.329" end="00:04:04.540" style="s2">organized into different teams to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.359" end="00:04:06.459" style="s2">those locations like you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.540" end="00:04:08.709" style="s2">different people going to different</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.459" end="00:04:10.569" style="s2">people&#39;s houses for a barbecue that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.709" end="00:04:13.449" style="s2">it&#39;ll self organized in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.569" end="00:04:17.019" style="s2">who cooks who this who gets drunk who</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.449" end="00:04:19.660" style="s2">plays baseball watches TV you know right</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.019" end="00:04:22.600" style="s2">I&#39;m them and yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">the end of the day there are some groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.600" end="00:04:26.470" style="s2">of people that are tighter than other</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:33.910" style="s2">groups of people but that would be kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.470" end="00:04:36.700" style="s2">of the idea there and and so broadly one</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.910" end="00:04:38.440" style="s2">of the mistakes that people doing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.700" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">teal organizations or alternative</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.440" end="00:04:44.980" style="s2">organizations is that they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:46.840" style="s2">they&#39;re just switching the context and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.980" end="00:04:49.210" style="s2">making the same mistakes right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.840" end="00:04:51.160" style="s2">they&#39;re switching to a team context but</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.210" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re making the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.160" end="00:04:55.030" style="s2">mistakes they&#39;re not eliminating the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:57.490" style="s2">politics of inclusion and exclusion now</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.030" end="00:04:59.860" style="s2">ideally you know that&#39;s an idealist</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.490" end="00:05:03.100" style="s2">position you can&#39;t eliminate it entirely</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.860" end="00:05:05.380" style="s2">but you can make it transparent in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.100" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">teamwork in your team-building exercises</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.380" end="00:05:16.480" style="s2">and your facilitation so it can tap into</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">higher performance so uh yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.480" end="00:05:21.330" style="s2">one little distinction is this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:21.330" style="s2">big deal</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.289" end="00:05:29.349" style="s2">you</p>
