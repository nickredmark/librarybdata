<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:17.190" style="s2">very nice day good</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:19.770" style="s2">so just I&#39;ll say up up top here that</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.190" end="00:00:23.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of delay between the zoom</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.770" end="00:00:24.630" style="s2">call and then the YouTube chat so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.160" end="00:00:27.270" style="s2">not gonna be able to engage with people</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.630" end="00:00:29.600" style="s2">if people have questions let&#39;s just save</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.270" end="00:00:32.249" style="s2">them for a little bit of time at the end</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.600" end="00:00:35.070" style="s2">and I&#39;ll check those when we get to that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.249" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">place yeah I mean periodically take a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.070" end="00:00:41.940" style="s2">few like a pause and see yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:44.179" style="s2">for sure okay I like that idea okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.940" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">so maybe I can just say a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.179" end="00:00:58.109" style="s2">about the impetus for this idea sorry</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:00.749" style="s2">the YouTube screen just popped up and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:05.399" style="s2">was hearing two voices okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.749" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">reason for this this conversation was I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.399" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">was interested in double-clicking on one</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">of the really important pieces of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">idea of cultivating sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:23.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a relationship to money and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">wealth and I&#39;ve been learning more about</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:27.509" style="s2">wealth creation I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">interested in it before I come from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.509" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">performing arts background and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">like never I&#39;ve never felt like it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">my ballgame so I never really paid much</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:40.670" style="s2">attention to it until very recently and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">one of my ways in was hearing people in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.670" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">this particular space game be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">system thinking space a lot of what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">thinkers had in common was some success</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">in in some entrepreneurial activity or</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:09.659" style="s2">venture that led to wealth and from an</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:13.129" style="s2">outsider&#39;s perspective seeing what your</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.659" end="00:02:13.129" style="s2">experience has been Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.240" end="00:02:17.620" style="s2">somebody who invested a lot of front-end</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.530" end="00:02:21.310" style="s2">energy into creating freedom for</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.620" end="00:02:24.580" style="s2">yourself the only reason you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.310" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">able to do like the deep thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.580" end="00:02:29.380" style="s2">sort of deep-sea diving into this game</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:33.100" style="s2">be spaces because you had the freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.380" end="00:02:38.680" style="s2">do it you didn&#39;t have to work you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.100" end="00:02:41.080" style="s2">have a clock in at an eye job so so as</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.680" end="00:02:43.210" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about game B and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.080" end="00:02:45.130" style="s2">transition be like what like what do</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.210" end="00:02:46.750" style="s2">business ventures look like in this new</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.130" end="00:02:51.370" style="s2">space that where people are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.750" end="00:02:52.710" style="s2">about what what&#39;s coming next and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.370" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">and a crucial piece just feels like</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.710" end="00:03:00.820" style="s2">being right relationship with with money</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:03.460" style="s2">and we had a pre call yesterday and one</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.820" end="00:03:04.750" style="s2">of the one of the things that which i</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.460" end="00:03:08.320" style="s2">think is a good place to start is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.750" end="00:03:11.470" style="s2">made a distinction between wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.320" end="00:03:14.170" style="s2">prosperity mm-hmm do you remember that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.470" end="00:03:15.610" style="s2">at the top of the conversation yeah does</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.170" end="00:03:20.320" style="s2">that feel like a good place to dive in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.610" end="00:03:21.880" style="s2">yeah I think so I think um I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.320" end="00:03:23.710" style="s2">I was also thinking about our call</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.880" end="00:03:25.480" style="s2">yesterday and some notions in that area</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.710" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">cannot summate Samir you can we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.480" end="00:03:30.820" style="s2">weave it together and another concept</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:32.350" style="s2">that came up for me that felt very close</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.820" end="00:03:37.300" style="s2">to connect it was just a more basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.350" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">notion called choice making and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.300" end="00:03:41.650" style="s2">one of the ways that we can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">notion of money is that money at the end</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.650" end="00:03:47.140" style="s2">of the day is a proxy for choice making</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:49.690" style="s2">and so if I am paying you if you&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.140" end="00:03:51.940" style="s2">employee one of the things that is part</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.690" end="00:03:54.250" style="s2">of that relationship is that I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.940" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">you money and you&#39;re giving me your</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.250" end="00:04:00.100" style="s2">choices meaning I get to tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:01.390" style="s2">to do to some extent right hmm and to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.100" end="00:04:04.810" style="s2">greater or lesser extent depending on</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.390" end="00:04:07.390" style="s2">the the nature of the relationship and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.810" end="00:04:09.700" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really nice way to to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.390" end="00:04:12.310" style="s2">begin to walk into at least one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.700" end="00:04:13.750" style="s2">to the question so this question is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.310" end="00:04:15.670" style="s2">distinct between wealth and prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.750" end="00:04:20.709" style="s2">came up when you were talking about your</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.670" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">own experience having a story yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.709" end="00:04:27.110" style="s2">the the inevitable corrupting</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:29.599" style="s2">characteristics of well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.110" end="00:04:32.780" style="s2">to make to have money and to have made</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.599" end="00:04:35.900" style="s2">money differently both involve different</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.780" end="00:04:39.650" style="s2">levels of unreasonable and inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.900" end="00:04:40.819" style="s2">corruption and and I talked about is</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.650" end="00:04:43.460" style="s2">this destitution wealth and prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.819" end="00:04:44.840" style="s2">which you know I mentioned by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.460" end="00:04:46.759" style="s2">you could just use this as two terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.840" end="00:04:48.199" style="s2">like I&#39;m don&#39;t want anchor on either one</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.759" end="00:04:49.879" style="s2">of those neither of those terms has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.199" end="00:04:51.500" style="s2">long eddy of a long etymologically</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.879" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">lineage that I&#39;d like to sort of point</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.500" end="00:04:53.689" style="s2">out as being more right than the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">than just saying because two ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.689" end="00:04:59.240" style="s2">looking at it and saying that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:03.379" style="s2">something about one direction or one</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:06.110" style="s2">origin or one disposition or basis of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.379" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">approach that we can call wealth or on</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.110" end="00:05:11.090" style="s2">the left hand side that tends to be more</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:13.000" style="s2">closely associated with with both</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.090" end="00:05:17.210" style="s2">personal corruption things that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.000" end="00:05:18.590" style="s2">reducing your sovereignty and external</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.210" end="00:05:20.389" style="s2">corruption things that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.590" end="00:05:22.310" style="s2">reducing other people&#39;s sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.389" end="00:05:24.229" style="s2">making actions in the world and reduce</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.310" end="00:05:26.180" style="s2">other people&#39;s sovereignty and we might</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.229" end="00:05:29.599" style="s2">say that at the center of that is his</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.180" end="00:05:31.009" style="s2">choices on the basis of beer and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.599" end="00:05:33.650" style="s2">talked about the notion of prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.009" end="00:05:36.159" style="s2">which has the characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.650" end="00:05:38.419" style="s2">increasing your sovereignty and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.159" end="00:05:40.310" style="s2">synergistically as you make choices out</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.419" end="00:05:41.900" style="s2">in the world tends to increase other</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.310" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">people&#39;s sovereignty and we might say</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.900" end="00:05:45.469" style="s2">that on the basis of love and if those</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:47.960" style="s2">of you who are familiar with Forrest</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.469" end="00:05:50.120" style="s2">Landers work I&#39;m clearly referencing</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.960" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">that in some way although my level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.120" end="00:05:52.909" style="s2">mastery of his workers to wear near high</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.379" style="s2">enough to say that I am sourcing from it</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.909" end="00:05:56.900" style="s2">but the distinctions that I&#39;m making are</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.379" end="00:06:00.440" style="s2">clearly echoed in Morocco in what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.900" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">written about in his book the effective</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.440" end="00:06:05.629" style="s2">choice and the ethics so so I&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:09.139" style="s2">you some examples that I thought over</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.629" end="00:06:10.129" style="s2">the past few days and this is one landed</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.139" end="00:06:11.479" style="s2">this morning that I thought was quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.129" end="00:06:13.699" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s turn this is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.479" end="00:06:15.229" style="s2">terms of just having well so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.699" end="00:06:17.029" style="s2">right now just talking about how you how</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.229" end="00:06:19.789" style="s2">you how you get well just active having</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.029" end="00:06:23.509" style="s2">it so just a pile of money lands on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.789" end="00:06:25.729" style="s2">lap magic and then I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.509" end="00:06:27.349" style="s2">actually quite interesting so what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.729" end="00:06:29.629" style="s2">is to say is that a pile of choice</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.349" end="00:06:33.050" style="s2">making a pile of the capacity to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.629" end="00:06:36.649" style="s2">your your will your what you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.050" end="00:06:38.149" style="s2">the case has just shifted in the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.649" end="00:06:41.180" style="s2">like you now have much more ability to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.149" end="00:06:43.250" style="s2">influence the nature of choice the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.180" end="00:06:45.800" style="s2">than you did before and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.250" end="00:06:47.780" style="s2">questions is how much and I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.800" end="00:06:50.950" style="s2">had this conversation the number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.780" end="00:06:55.640" style="s2">people and there actually seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.950" end="00:06:57.170" style="s2">converging notion that one there needs</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.640" end="00:06:58.940" style="s2">to be a symmetry between your</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.170" end="00:07:02.060" style="s2">sovereignty and your choice linking</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.940" end="00:07:04.250" style="s2">capacity so as you have more let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.060" end="00:07:07.190" style="s2">wisdom as an aspect of sovereignty as</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.250" end="00:07:09.140" style="s2">you have more capacity to make choice as</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.190" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">you people more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.140" end="00:07:15.220" style="s2">looking to you to be making choices</p>

<p begin="00:07:22.700" end="00:07:26.060" style="s2">like this that notion of symmetry and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.350" end="00:07:28.220" style="s2">being very mindful of it but then we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.060" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">this interesting artifact that because</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.220" end="00:07:33.110" style="s2">of the nature of money money in many</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:34.760" style="s2">ways is certainly decouples those two</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.110" end="00:07:36.410" style="s2">you can have money without having wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.760" end="00:07:38.150" style="s2">and in many ways in fact goes the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.410" end="00:07:41.290" style="s2">opposite the less wisdom you have making</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.150" end="00:07:42.890" style="s2">the more possibility of money might have</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.290" end="00:07:45.800" style="s2">but then there&#39;s another really</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.890" end="00:07:47.150" style="s2">interesting thing which is it is fair to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.800" end="00:07:48.860" style="s2">say and which is to say I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.150" end="00:07:52.490" style="s2">number of conversations with quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.860" end="00:07:55.240" style="s2">thoughtful people that no human can have</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.490" end="00:07:57.590" style="s2">enough wisdom to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.240" end="00:08:00.470" style="s2">effective choices beyond about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.590" end="00:08:02.870" style="s2">million dollars so if you have more than</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.470" end="00:08:04.130" style="s2">a hundred million dollars and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.870" end="00:08:05.390" style="s2">making effective choices it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.130" end="00:08:06.650" style="s2">impossible like if you have a billion</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.650" end="00:08:11.090" style="s2">ineffective choices no matter how wise</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.390" end="00:08:12.410" style="s2">and sovereign you are there&#39;s just way</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.090" end="00:08:15.170" style="s2">too much asymmetry like if you think</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.410" end="00:08:16.970" style="s2">about how much choice making embodied in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.170" end="00:08:19.100" style="s2">money so how much wealth the average</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.970" end="00:08:21.170" style="s2">person has you know the average American</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.100" end="00:08:23.270" style="s2">has you know whatever $50,000 worth of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.170" end="00:08:25.040" style="s2">networks maybe less I don&#39;t know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.270" end="00:08:26.810" style="s2">a lot of debt going around may average</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.040" end="00:08:29.000" style="s2">human probably has you know close close</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.810" end="00:08:30.290" style="s2">to a buck all right so or maybe less</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.000" end="00:08:32.300" style="s2">again so let&#39;s just say it&#39;s a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.290" end="00:08:35.000" style="s2">per person on the planet and you happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.300" end="00:08:36.830" style="s2">to have a billion dollars well in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.000" end="00:08:39.530" style="s2">sense what that says is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.830" end="00:08:42.650" style="s2">have at least a billion times as much</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.530" end="00:08:43.940" style="s2">wisdom to be able to have the enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.650" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">wisdom to carry that amount of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.940" end="00:08:47.810" style="s2">choice-making capacity and that ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:49.160" style="s2">gonna happen and presumably a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.810" end="00:08:50.450" style="s2">million is also pretty high standard</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.160" end="00:08:53.300" style="s2">like that seems also pretty darn</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.450" end="00:08:55.480" style="s2">impossible but it&#39;s an interesting kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.300" end="00:08:59.570" style="s2">of heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.480" end="00:09:00.529" style="s2">it seems that it&#39;s plausible like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.570" end="00:09:03.560" style="s2">really does seem like a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.529" end="00:09:06.200" style="s2">proposition to say in terms of creating</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.560" end="00:09:08.350" style="s2">wealth in terms of having wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.200" end="00:09:10.459" style="s2">then you cream wealth and having wealth</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.350" end="00:09:12.620" style="s2">once you&#39;ve made about ten million</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.459" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">dollars you&#39;re beginning to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.620" end="00:09:17.570" style="s2">zone where you&#39;re increasingly likely to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:21.230" style="s2">be having more choice making capacity</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.570" end="00:09:23.000" style="s2">than you can actually deploy with wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.230" end="00:09:24.770" style="s2">with effect to make effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.000" end="00:09:26.300" style="s2">with that and if you blown past a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.770" end="00:09:28.820" style="s2">hundred million you have almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.300" end="00:09:29.959" style="s2">certainly put yourself in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.820" end="00:09:31.520" style="s2">you&#39;re just going to be making more</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.959" end="00:09:33.410" style="s2">trouble more and more bad than good</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.520" end="00:09:35.779" style="s2">kind of an odd heuristic like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.410" end="00:09:37.160" style="s2">funny thing to say and I remember when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.779" end="00:09:38.810" style="s2">first got into the Entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.160" end="00:09:41.089" style="s2">gamma class first getting involvement</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.810" end="00:09:43.670" style="s2">very first startup I remember thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.089" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">to myself that ten million dollars was</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.670" end="00:09:46.580" style="s2">an insane amount of money like I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">grow up with any meaningful amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.580" end="00:09:48.740" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:50.510" style="s2">I&#39;m intact we were reasonably poor for</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.740" end="00:09:52.820" style="s2">sensible fractional they&#39;re not all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.510" end="00:09:54.529" style="s2">it and I remember being like if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.820" end="00:09:55.820" style="s2">came to me and said you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.529" end="00:09:57.230" style="s2">this is gonna work out is you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.820" end="00:09:58.550" style="s2">do acts and at the end it actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.230" end="00:10:01.730" style="s2">have ten million dollars I would have</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.550" end="00:10:03.620" style="s2">gone like yes done signed I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.730" end="00:10:05.270" style="s2">going to cap and if they&#39;d come and said</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.620" end="00:10:06.740" style="s2">look here&#39;s the deal you&#39;re gonna get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.270" end="00:10:08.350" style="s2">work and it&#39;s gonna be hard like a low</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:11.029" style="s2">likelihood of success hard work and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.350" end="00:10:12.290" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna cap you can make no more</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.029" end="00:10:14.120" style="s2">than a hundred million dollars I</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.290" end="00:10:15.800" style="s2">would&#39;ve just sort of laughed at like</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.120" end="00:10:17.089" style="s2">what you basically just do a magic</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.800" end="00:10:20.089" style="s2">number I mean these aren&#39;t real numbers</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.089" end="00:10:21.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not a real set and I&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.089" end="00:10:23.480" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s actually a really good idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.320" end="00:10:24.980" style="s2">like as an individual if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.480" end="00:10:27.110" style="s2">into entrepreneurship you&#39;re going into</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.980" end="00:10:28.339" style="s2">the startup gig for example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.110" end="00:10:30.980" style="s2">really trying to go hard in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.339" end="00:10:33.170" style="s2">direction of moving a whole bunch of gay</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.980" end="00:10:34.579" style="s2">made ships from other people to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.170" end="00:10:36.410" style="s2">which so what&#39;s happening right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.579" end="00:10:41.690" style="s2">taking choice-making away from some</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.410" end="00:10:43.490" style="s2">people and giving it to yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.690" end="00:10:44.990" style="s2">know if you if you&#39;ve done something</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.490" end="00:10:46.520" style="s2">where ten million dollars has it has</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.990" end="00:10:48.649" style="s2">accrued to your side of the balance</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.520" end="00:10:50.420" style="s2">sheet that that&#39;s the point at which</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.649" end="00:10:53.779" style="s2">taking your foot off the accelerator is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.420" end="00:10:55.310" style="s2">an increasingly wise choice and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.779" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">probably shouldn&#39;t be making a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.310" end="00:10:58.700" style="s2">more than like 30 40 unless it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:00.170" style="s2">luck like you just did something where</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.700" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just gonna kind of have some number</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.170" end="00:11:04.430" style="s2">and if you&#39;ve made more than a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably actually been doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.430" end="00:11:10.570" style="s2">something that has been call it to my</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:10.570" style="s2">in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.690" end="00:11:15.290" style="s2">making too much money and not in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.970" style="s2">direction of actually making effective</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.290" end="00:11:21.410" style="s2">choices as a heuristic as a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.970" end="00:11:22.550" style="s2">now notably oddly enough and some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.410" end="00:11:27.160" style="s2">these conversations we actually were</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.550" end="00:11:30.230" style="s2">able to identify certain locations where</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.160" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">some of the some of the objectives the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.230" end="00:11:35.420" style="s2">things that were being endeavored we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:37.640" style="s2">almost certainly important they needed</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.420" end="00:11:39.590" style="s2">to happen and it seemed to be very much</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.640" end="00:11:42.010" style="s2">part of the vocation like the colony of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.590" end="00:11:44.900" style="s2">the individual would say L on Musk and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.010" end="00:11:47.240" style="s2">searching the world from oil to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.900" end="00:11:48.530" style="s2">electricity thank you it&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.240" end="00:11:51.380" style="s2">really good idea like that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.530" end="00:11:53.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s in the path viable</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.380" end="00:11:57.260" style="s2">futures is that shift and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.270" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like he&#39;s uniquely called to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.260" end="00:12:00.410" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about his very</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:02.660" style="s2">being that seems to be uniquely called</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.410" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">to do that and to the degree to which he</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.660" end="00:12:07.160" style="s2">is truly fully in service to his calling</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:09.470" style="s2">and also money is flowing through that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.160" end="00:12:10.640" style="s2">that seems plausible but then you look</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.470" end="00:12:13.640" style="s2">at something like neural lace and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.640" end="00:12:15.260" style="s2">like hmm mmm neural lace feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.640" end="00:12:18.680" style="s2">may be something where his choice making</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.260" end="00:12:20.210" style="s2">is now too high and that&#39;s not his</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.680" end="00:12:22.070" style="s2">calling I don&#39;t think it feels very much</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.210" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">like he&#39;s doing something where he has</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.070" end="00:12:25.130" style="s2">the ability to make it happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:27.230" style="s2">world but it&#39;s not really his to do and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.130" end="00:12:31.820" style="s2">there&#39;s an error that&#39;s beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.230" end="00:12:34.390" style="s2">emerge on that side so wait a second hi</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.820" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">I&#39;m just curious how you pick up on that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.390" end="00:12:37.880" style="s2">likes it like the making that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:39.170" style="s2">distinction between oh this might not be</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.880" end="00:12:40.580" style="s2">as calling us because these it is</p>

<p begin="00:12:40.580" end="00:12:47.180" style="s2">into other things already if I listen to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.050" end="00:12:50.690" style="s2">the thought process that goes into</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.180" end="00:12:52.340" style="s2">neural lace it&#39;s it&#39;s he&#39;s basically</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.840" style="s2">the AI story and the singularity story</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.160" end="00:13:10.910" style="s2">is really big and real and dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.840" end="00:13:12.770" style="s2">my sure istic SAR telling me that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.910" end="00:13:14.270" style="s2">only viable path is one more man and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.770" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">machine merge and so we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.270" end="00:13:18.410" style="s2">that happen but it doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:19.910" style="s2">it&#39;s something that he&#39;s embodying all</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.410" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">the way down to the bottom like if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.910" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">were to really go in and start beginning</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.500" end="00:13:25.430" style="s2">to ask deep questions about the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:26.810" style="s2">nature of synapses and the nature</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.430" end="00:13:28.730" style="s2">of consciousness like these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.810" end="00:13:32.810" style="s2">hard questions that honestly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.730" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">gonna be promoting human brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.810" end="00:13:37.670" style="s2">augmentation and into machines you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">should have that you should be a master</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.670" end="00:13:41.029" style="s2">of this field like this should be your</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:44.390" style="s2"> life like you shouldn&#39;t be even</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.029" end="00:13:46.430" style="s2">the least bit of a tourist you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.390" end="00:13:48.050" style="s2">about cars at that point you should give</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.430" end="00:13:49.490" style="s2">zero shits about cars yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.050" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing it should be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.490" end="00:13:52.610" style="s2">hundred percent of your focus so much so</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:54.110" style="s2">that you don&#39;t even know you came in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.610" end="00:13:56.360" style="s2">distinguish between yourself in it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.110" end="00:13:59.080" style="s2">that&#39;s my point and that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.360" end="00:13:59.080" style="s2">by calling so</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.300" end="00:14:02.089" style="s2">that kind of branches so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.890" end="00:14:03.769" style="s2">thousand they stop there so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.089" end="00:14:06.110" style="s2">point of saying okay let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.769" end="00:14:07.670" style="s2">choice making in this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.110" end="00:14:08.899" style="s2">symmetry between your sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.670" end="00:14:10.850" style="s2">the amount of choice making that you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.899" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">literally able to carry like how much</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.850" end="00:14:16.190" style="s2">responsibility can you actually take in</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:17.300" style="s2">the world and be likely quite likely to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.190" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">make effective choices with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.300" end="00:14:20.450" style="s2">responsibility and the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:22.250" style="s2">there&#39;s almost certainly just an upper</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.450" end="00:14:24.260" style="s2">limit that no human being could ever</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.250" end="00:14:26.060" style="s2">carry more than a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.260" end="00:14:27.170" style="s2">responsibility which then shows up as an</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">upper limit of the amount of wealth that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.170" end="00:14:33.740" style="s2">you should ever accrue to yourself hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:38.180" style="s2">do you think do you think if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.740" end="00:14:39.709" style="s2">really tuned in to their calling they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.180" end="00:14:43.399" style="s2">have an idea of how much responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.709" end="00:14:44.600" style="s2">they should be taking on yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.399" end="00:14:46.700" style="s2">think this actually has a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.600" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">different characteristics to it and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.700" end="00:14:51.230" style="s2">said really so me just focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:57.820" style="s2">word because it has a lot of nuance to</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.230" end="00:14:57.820" style="s2">it hmm so one piece is something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.510" end="00:15:05.720" style="s2">some people many people I think who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.149" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">attracted to the story of game B put</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.720" end="00:15:09.890" style="s2">themselves too much into it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:11.899" style="s2">trying to carry more than is theirs to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.890" end="00:15:13.250" style="s2">care in fact sometimes I try to carry</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.899" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">the whole thing oftentimes they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:16.700" style="s2">I&#39;m the only one like they don&#39;t they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:19.010" style="s2">never met anybody else who&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.700" end="00:15:21.230" style="s2">really earnestly like sees it and feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.010" end="00:15:22.490" style="s2">it just is committed to it and so like</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.230" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">oh I guess I guess I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.490" end="00:15:27.800" style="s2">have to do the whole thing yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:29.420" style="s2">is of course too heavy it&#39;s way too much</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.800" end="00:15:31.459" style="s2">no human could possibly carry the whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.420" end="00:15:34.190" style="s2">thing even vaguely yeah can I can I say</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.459" end="00:15:37.100" style="s2">something about that sure I like I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.190" end="00:15:40.220" style="s2">a lot of a lot of the engagements happy</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.100" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">happening on social media and Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.220" end="00:15:43.130" style="s2">for example is like where a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:47.209" style="s2">sorts of conversations happen and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.130" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">Twitter definitely selects for a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.209" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">Pythias like a like really sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.170" end="00:15:54.730" style="s2">if you were good at writing philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:56.930" style="s2">papers in college and like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.730" end="00:15:59.180" style="s2">decent sense of humor when you write</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.930" end="00:16:02.930" style="s2">like Twitter&#39;s gonna select for those</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.180" end="00:16:04.459" style="s2">sort of ideas or memes that pop up you</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.930" end="00:16:06.199" style="s2">know and I think I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.459" end="00:16:07.990" style="s2">saying about people feeling like they</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.199" end="00:16:10.520" style="s2">need to take on more than it&#39;s theirs</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.990" end="00:16:12.950" style="s2">there might be just like a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.520" end="00:16:15.410" style="s2">imagination of the lab</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.950" end="00:16:18.980" style="s2">that these sorts of ideas could be could</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.410" end="00:16:20.510" style="s2">be played in does that make sense no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.980" end="00:16:21.950" style="s2">sure it does but I didn&#39;t follow so it</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.510" end="00:16:23.089" style="s2">felt like a shift that happened there</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.950" end="00:16:25.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something in that shift that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.089" end="00:16:28.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t receive okay okay I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.190" end="00:16:30.709" style="s2">it like because because Twitter or</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.700" end="00:16:33.949" style="s2">social media is like the public square</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.709" end="00:16:39.290" style="s2">where these ideas are talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.949" end="00:16:42.199" style="s2">seems kind of like a one it&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.290" end="00:16:44.560" style="s2">facet of engaging with these ideas like</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.199" end="00:16:47.779" style="s2">there are other places for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:49.790" style="s2">experiments with collectives in-person</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.779" end="00:16:51.350" style="s2">collectives and that may not be open</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.790" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">sourcing their experiments on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.350" end="00:16:55.639" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">or maybe and we just haven&#39;t found them</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.639" end="00:17:01.430" style="s2">because the Internet&#39;s are gigantic</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:03.819" style="s2">you know that&#39;s yeah yeah so I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.430" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">the whole point of what I was saying is</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.819" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">people taking on too much part of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:13.100" style="s2">just feels like for what&#39;s selected for</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:14.329" style="s2">in the public square right now so some</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.100" end="00:17:17.329" style="s2">that maybe maybe let me just say some</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.329" end="00:17:19.549" style="s2">things back so let&#39;s imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.329" end="00:17:20.829" style="s2">there&#39;s a really big story oh how fun -</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.549" end="00:17:23.150" style="s2">with the concept of transmedia</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.829" end="00:17:27.410" style="s2">transmedia I can put the two words</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.150" end="00:17:30.380" style="s2">together but what&#39;s funny cuz if if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.410" end="00:17:32.179" style="s2">if you use like the transcendent sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.380" end="00:17:33.980" style="s2">like Conte and transcendence or</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.179" end="00:17:35.780" style="s2">transcendence and you and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.980" end="00:17:37.100" style="s2">combine that with media and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.780" end="00:17:38.600" style="s2">it like that&#39;s an interesting comment</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.100" end="00:17:40.970" style="s2">combination you&#39;re definitely the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.600" end="00:17:42.470" style="s2">zone but for the moment I&#39;ll just make</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.970" end="00:17:44.570" style="s2">it a little bit more prosaic and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.470" end="00:17:47.059" style="s2">pop it back up but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.570" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">that we learn in transmedia is that each</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.059" end="00:17:55.400" style="s2">medium is kind of has its thing so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:57.919" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to tell a story and the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.400" end="00:17:59.390" style="s2">should be told in a comic book because</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.919" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">of the nature of the story and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.390" end="00:18:04.460" style="s2">nature of the medium and I tried it -</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:06.049" style="s2">that story in a movie I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.460" end="00:18:07.640" style="s2">something wrong it won&#39;t land right like</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.049" end="00:18:09.230" style="s2">the medium just can&#39;t carry the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.640" end="00:18:10.280" style="s2">characteristics of whatever it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.230" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">the nature of the particular story</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.280" end="00:18:14.270" style="s2">rightly to make it more obvious like if</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.280" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to tell the story that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.270" end="00:18:17.929" style="s2">should be told in a painting and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.280" end="00:18:20.419" style="s2">trying to tell it in a radio play</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.929" end="00:18:22.790" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be hard random like and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.419" end="00:18:24.590" style="s2">see green and the brushstrokes are thick</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.790" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">you know that just as an obvious you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.590" end="00:18:29.420" style="s2">know each medium can carry different</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">aspects what transmedia says is hey man</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.420" end="00:18:35.240" style="s2">there is no story that any one medium</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">can hold and in fact all media and by</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.240" end="00:18:39.830" style="s2">all media I mean literally all phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.340" end="00:18:42.410" style="s2">in physical reality that can carry</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.830" end="00:18:44.210" style="s2">signal must be considered as part of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.169" end="00:24:58.850" style="s2">yeah well okay when you were first</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:02.059" style="s2">talking I immediately saw its connection</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.850" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">to relationship with money and then I</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.059" end="00:25:06.830" style="s2">didn&#39;t for a while and then maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:09.669" style="s2">kind of circled back so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.830" end="00:25:13.509" style="s2">kind of let me take a crack at where</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.669" end="00:25:13.509" style="s2">where I think I want to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.899" end="00:25:22.609" style="s2">the idea of propositional verses</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.409" end="00:25:26.059" style="s2">participatory knowing yeah it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.609" end="00:25:28.309" style="s2">stories are constructed based on either</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.059" end="00:25:34.450" style="s2">or both sort of those two ways of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.309" end="00:25:37.450" style="s2">knowing interacting in some way and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.450" end="00:25:40.789" style="s2">was reflecting on how stories around</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:47.710" style="s2">money are created people&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.789" end="00:25:50.840" style="s2">relationship to safety security like</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.710" end="00:25:53.720" style="s2">whether or not they deserve abundance</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.840" end="00:25:55.879" style="s2">like there are all these like codes that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.720" end="00:25:59.059" style="s2">can get put in place that might affect</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.879" end="00:26:08.389" style="s2">one&#39;s relationship to money which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.059" end="00:26:12.739" style="s2">just flow energy so let&#39;s talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.389" end="00:26:15.289" style="s2">bit about where some of those stories</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.739" end="00:26:18.950" style="s2">come from and as someone who talks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.289" end="00:26:20.690" style="s2">about sovereignty what are ways of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.950" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">engaging with those stories in a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.690" end="00:26:29.389" style="s2">that feels helpful wow that&#39;s great so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:31.909" style="s2">obviously right now I would like to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.389" end="00:26:33.859" style="s2">up there as a caveat a big caveat which</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.909" end="00:26:38.600" style="s2">is just to say that we&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.859" end="00:26:40.460" style="s2">conversation and it&#39;s just us and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.600" end="00:26:43.309" style="s2">people commenting on it in YouTube but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.460" end="00:26:44.539" style="s2">have no no sense whatsoever but I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.309" end="00:26:47.480" style="s2">vaguely answer the question you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.539" end="00:26:49.369" style="s2">asking in a deeply rich or whole way all</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.480" end="00:26:50.690" style="s2">I can do is maybe nudge a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.369" end="00:26:52.369" style="s2">the direction right so I would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.690" end="00:26:54.230" style="s2">putting some things out there it&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.369" end="00:26:56.929" style="s2">that makes sense to me and feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.230" end="00:26:58.639" style="s2">meaningful I am quite certain that if</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.929" end="00:27:00.679" style="s2">this is even a small part it&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.639" end="00:27:02.090" style="s2">very small part of that news story cool</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.679" end="00:27:07.889" style="s2">and it&#39;s coming each person will have</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.090" end="00:27:13.529" style="s2">their own yeah so some things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.889" end="00:27:13.529" style="s2">as we&#39;re talking about money my is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.179" end="00:27:22.179" style="s2">there&#39;s struggle has our has is implicit</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:25.629" style="s2">in money there has been money is is mm</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.179" end="00:27:28.179" style="s2">Wow so should take this for as part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.629" end="00:27:30.129" style="s2">the story and then I know if this is how</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.179" end="00:27:34.589" style="s2">true this story is but it is something</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.129" end="00:27:38.769" style="s2">to that&#39;s useful a long time ago like</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.589" end="00:27:42.579" style="s2">100 years ago and a lot longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.769" end="00:27:44.979" style="s2">humans routinely had to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.579" end="00:27:46.779" style="s2">problem of scarcity like it was just the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.979" end="00:27:48.940" style="s2">nature of life the nature of life was</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.779" end="00:27:49.899" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna go hungry and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.940" end="00:27:51.399" style="s2">the nature of life was the quite often</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.899" end="00:27:52.809" style="s2">would go a lot hungry and some of us</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.399" end="00:27:54.849" style="s2">from die of starvation depending on</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.809" end="00:27:57.190" style="s2">where we were and the the vicissitudes</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.849" end="00:27:58.989" style="s2">of nature in fact if you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.190" end="00:28:01.329" style="s2">origin story of humans like the way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.989" end="00:28:04.419" style="s2">we currently tell the story in Western</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.329" end="00:28:06.759" style="s2">science is that we almost didn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.419" end="00:28:08.889" style="s2">as a species like we almost died out and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.759" end="00:28:12.009" style="s2">so this notion of how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.889" end="00:28:14.589" style="s2">deal with privation not just scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.009" end="00:28:16.690" style="s2">for privation is deeply fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.589" end="00:28:18.579" style="s2">the notion that we we live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.690" end="00:28:20.889" style="s2">where it&#39;s at least plausible that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.579" end="00:28:23.409" style="s2">people no longer need to go hungry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.889" end="00:28:25.389" style="s2">actually a relatively recent idea you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.409" end="00:28:28.659" style="s2">know up until the middle of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.389" end="00:28:30.669" style="s2">century it was obvious that some people</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.659" end="00:28:32.709" style="s2">are going to go without and some people</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.669" end="00:28:34.899" style="s2">gonna go and go without a lot and go</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.709" end="00:28:36.789" style="s2">without lots of things like food and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.899" end="00:28:38.769" style="s2">know warmth in the in the winter and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.789" end="00:28:44.079" style="s2">nice clothes and fill in the plain and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.769" end="00:28:45.609" style="s2">so the money exists in in at least in</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.079" end="00:28:46.809" style="s2">some sense at the some aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.609" end="00:28:49.659" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of things going on here but</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.809" end="00:28:51.629" style="s2">least in some aspects in order to answer</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.659" end="00:28:53.829" style="s2">the question who&#39;s gonna go without</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.629" end="00:28:55.509" style="s2">those who have more money don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.829" end="00:28:56.469" style="s2">those who have less money do and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.509" end="00:28:58.659" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the question of how do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.469" end="00:28:59.589" style="s2">get it how do we allocate the money but</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.659" end="00:29:01.419" style="s2">that&#39;s actually really important to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.589" end="00:29:03.459" style="s2">recognize the embedded in the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.419" end="00:29:06.070" style="s2">fundamental assumption of money is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.459" end="00:29:07.809" style="s2">scarcity and in embedded in in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.070" end="00:29:11.829" style="s2">psychology of scarcity is its act</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.809" end="00:29:13.779" style="s2">privation of truly being at the edge and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.829" end="00:29:16.179" style="s2">maybe on the other side of the edge and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.779" end="00:29:17.619" style="s2">this is this makes sense so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.179" end="00:29:19.479" style="s2">touching money like when you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.619" end="00:29:21.040" style="s2">holding it you&#39;re holding that lineage</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.479" end="00:29:24.250" style="s2">you&#39;re holding that history in it can I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.040" end="00:29:26.050" style="s2">help would be felt inside you and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.250" end="00:29:27.220" style="s2">moment that I have money is also the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.050" end="00:29:30.340" style="s2">moment become aware the fact that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.220" end="00:29:31.990" style="s2">might not have money and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.340" end="00:29:34.510" style="s2">even a point in childhood we become</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.990" end="00:29:37.810" style="s2">aware of this we become aware the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.510" end="00:29:39.910" style="s2">that whatever is coming to you that has</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.810" end="00:29:42.070" style="s2">so far been coming to you as a nature of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.910" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">family and your family may or may not</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.070" end="00:29:44.710" style="s2">have resources but you don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">what&#39;s the limit you just know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.710" end="00:29:48.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a flow that come because of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:49.870" style="s2">relationship and there&#39;s a point in</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.700" end="00:29:51.100" style="s2">which become conscious to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.870" end="00:29:54.550" style="s2">there&#39;s this other object out there</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.100" end="00:29:57.940" style="s2">called money that is the thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.550" end="00:29:59.170" style="s2">that implication so then we have all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.940" end="00:30:01.000" style="s2">stories that are built around that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.170" end="00:30:03.550" style="s2">kinds of stories right you&#39;ve got like</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.000" end="00:30:05.170" style="s2">class conflict stories there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.550" end="00:30:09.310" style="s2">right for the past several hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.170" end="00:30:11.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve had formal efforts to shift the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.310" end="00:30:13.150" style="s2">way that we resource and allocate</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.500" end="00:30:16.710" style="s2">privation and whether we&#39;re a loss or</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.150" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">resource and allocate plenitude through</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.710" end="00:30:22.210" style="s2">formal narrative through manifestos and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:24.460" style="s2">propaganda right telling stories that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.210" end="00:30:26.290" style="s2">weaponize or try to create conflict to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.460" end="00:30:27.190" style="s2">shift that and I&#39;m not you know saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.290" end="00:30:28.510" style="s2">that that&#39;s a bad thing I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.190" end="00:30:30.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s been out there</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.510" end="00:30:34.240" style="s2">and a lot of that stuff but those</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.370" end="00:30:36.910" style="s2">stories in the the mimetic vector of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.240" end="00:30:38.140" style="s2">those stories the they were designed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.910" end="00:30:40.570" style="s2">land right they were designed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.140" end="00:30:42.130" style="s2">influence and change behavior and some</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.570" end="00:30:43.630" style="s2">of them are told in a very pithy way and</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.130" end="00:30:45.790" style="s2">they land aggressively and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.630" end="00:30:48.460" style="s2">this is true on both sides right so one</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.790" end="00:30:50.590" style="s2">side might tell a story of you know you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.460" end="00:30:52.420" style="s2">worked really hard you earned this money</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.590" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">and the money that you have is in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.420" end="00:30:57.430" style="s2">sign of your virtue alright and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:31:00.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a story and that story protects</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.430" end="00:31:02.290" style="s2">your readiness and willingness to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.490" end="00:31:05.530" style="s2">an earn money and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.290" end="00:31:07.270" style="s2">story that says that merely</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.530" end="00:31:09.250" style="s2">participating in the system of money</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.270" end="00:31:11.260" style="s2">makes you as complicit in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.250" end="00:31:14.830" style="s2">exploitation of the billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.260" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">who are absolutely harmed in at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.830" end="00:31:20.590" style="s2">some senses by the global capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">there&#39;s another story right and and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.590" end="00:31:25.630" style="s2">story makes it very difficult to choose</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:27.130" style="s2">to to make an older money and we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.630" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">recognize these are both weapons both of</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.170" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">I can tell once I can pick some stories</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.300" end="00:35:28.630" style="s2">to talk about how I&#39;m really justified</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:30.730" style="s2">and by the way I can rationalize the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.630" end="00:35:32.230" style="s2"> out of it because they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.730" end="00:35:33.400" style="s2">that job I&#39;ve made sure that if they</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.230" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that what would they have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.400" end="00:35:38.140" style="s2">be even more impoverished or I could</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:40.750" style="s2">pick the other stories and try to tell</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.140" end="00:35:42.250" style="s2">other stories that support that the</p>

<p begin="00:35:42.250" end="00:35:49.060" style="s2">make and in my the thing that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.640" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">to convey is all of that all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.060" end="00:35:53.350" style="s2">actually getting in between you and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:55.030" style="s2">truly being a sovereign being in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.350" end="00:35:57.960" style="s2">world and your capacity to make</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.650" end="00:36:07.269" style="s2">and that&#39;s a which loosing weights</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.749" end="00:36:09.130" style="s2">ethics so that&#39;s the proposition that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.269" end="00:36:11.160" style="s2">would put out there is almost first</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.130" end="00:36:13.779" style="s2">order for any choice that you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.160" end="00:36:17.650" style="s2">and in the context of what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.779" end="00:36:19.210" style="s2">about here at least ostensively of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.650" end="00:36:22.859" style="s2">know entrepreneurship or wealth creation</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.210" end="00:36:27.249" style="s2">same thing if you are being guided by</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.859" end="00:36:29.170" style="s2">memes if you&#39;re being guided by malware</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.249" end="00:36:31.240" style="s2">by narratives that have been constructed</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.170" end="00:36:34.569" style="s2">by other people for their own purposes</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.240" end="00:36:36.339" style="s2">then you&#39;re being separated from your</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.569" end="00:36:42.190" style="s2">capacity to make the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.339" end="00:36:46.619" style="s2">choices that you could make hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.190" end="00:36:51.789" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it seems like what&#39;s required</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.619" end="00:36:56.170" style="s2">is a disciplined practice in perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.789" end="00:36:58.749" style="s2">what is rather than overlaying it with</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.170" end="00:37:00.609" style="s2">cuz cuz overlaying something with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.749" end="00:37:02.170" style="s2">meaning or a story happens unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.609" end="00:37:05.279" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.170" end="00:37:07.720" style="s2">oh yeah you like think you&#39;re observing</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.279" end="00:37:11.200" style="s2">reality as it is and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.720" end="00:37:13.239" style="s2">actually doing is there&#39;s some story</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.200" end="00:37:15.730" style="s2">that&#39;s in there that maybe you developed</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.239" end="00:37:17.440" style="s2">as a kid to survive in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.730" end="00:37:19.269" style="s2">and it&#39;s still running your your</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.440" end="00:37:22.529" style="s2">programming and you can just accept that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.269" end="00:37:27.069" style="s2">as you could accept that as as reality</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.529" end="00:37:30.299" style="s2">so like is it Turtles all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.069" end="00:37:32.230" style="s2">to really seeing reality truly as it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.299" end="00:37:32.589" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.230" end="00:37:33.789" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.589" end="00:37:34.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s Turtles all the way down if</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.789" end="00:37:36.190" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to run it from the top of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.839" end="00:37:37.989" style="s2">the stack you&#39;re trying to run it</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.190" end="00:37:39.400" style="s2">through propositional knowing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.989" end="00:37:40.660" style="s2">Turtles all the way down which is to say</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.339" end="00:39:36.529" style="s2">vastly too much yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.859" end="00:39:38.359" style="s2">can you talk about what what you meant</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.529" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">by that unpack that idea a little more</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.359" end="00:39:42.589" style="s2">yeah but can I just hold me to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:43.579" style="s2">and bring me back to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.589" end="00:39:45.319" style="s2">something that in what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.579" end="00:39:46.670" style="s2">that I wanted to I wanted to pop out</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.670" end="00:39:49.940" style="s2">important yeah that&#39;s right cuz so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.770" end="00:39:51.619" style="s2">branch that brought us here was the</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:01.490" style="s2">projects right okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.460" end="00:40:06.109" style="s2">yeah and what I wanted to highlight was</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.490" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">that my sense is that the the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.109" end="00:40:10.460" style="s2">choice for a given individual say for</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.230" end="00:40:53.460" style="s2">very little bit that I can say about my</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.120" end="00:40:57.720" style="s2">own personal experience that should be</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.590" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">end up going in this direction and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.420" end="00:41:09.870" style="s2">you can say well okay well nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:12.090" style="s2">enquiries know who am i and how does my</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.870" end="00:41:14.280" style="s2">- show up like if it turns out that your</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.290" end="00:44:19.980" style="s2">particularly the domain of strategy</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.880" end="00:44:21.900" style="s2">around technology because I would do</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.980" end="00:44:24.300" style="s2">strategy around technology I need to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.900" end="00:44:25.580" style="s2">able to grasp technology very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.300" end="00:44:29.250" style="s2">which means I need to be able to hold</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.580" end="00:44:31.070" style="s2">like lots of stuff in my head so I need</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.250" end="00:44:33.090" style="s2">to be really smart like really smart and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.070" end="00:44:34.740" style="s2">I need to have done something</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.090" end="00:44:36.900" style="s2">developmentally that put a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.740" end="00:44:38.250" style="s2">information in my head and also not be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.900" end="00:44:39.990" style="s2">scientist because that&#39;s the scientist</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.250" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">is like really smart may understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.990" end="00:44:43.320" style="s2">Science and Technology have to have this</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:45.860" style="s2">other characteristic which is that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.320" end="00:44:48.210" style="s2">actually have strategy as part of my</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.860" end="00:44:49.740" style="s2">modus operandi something that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.210" end="00:44:51.420" style="s2">motivated to deploy in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.740" end="00:44:54.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually spent lifetime life energy</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.420" end="00:44:55.890" style="s2">on developing capacity so that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.510" end="00:44:57.180" style="s2">like I just described myself like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.890" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">and then by the way just to add one</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.180" end="00:45:01.120" style="s2">third</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:03.010" style="s2">piece to it because as I was growing up</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.120" end="00:45:04.390" style="s2">things like role-playing games and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.010" end="00:45:05.620" style="s2">science fiction and comic books are a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.390" end="00:45:09.310" style="s2">big part of my developmental environment</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.620" end="00:45:11.770" style="s2">the notion that the world is very much</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.310" end="00:45:13.240" style="s2">made up and we can we can choose to just</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.770" end="00:45:16.090" style="s2">make up a different story and if we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.240" end="00:45:17.470" style="s2">make that story more real than it is was</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.090" end="00:45:17.920" style="s2">again part of my developmental</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.470" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.920" end="00:45:22.660" style="s2">okay well only a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:23.710" style="s2">characteristics that are gonna select</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.660" end="00:45:26.050" style="s2">for people who are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.710" end="00:45:28.390" style="s2">successful in any niche that has those</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.050" end="00:45:28.870" style="s2">as the constraints most doesn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.390" end="00:45:31.510" style="s2">like me</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.870" end="00:45:33.880" style="s2">those them will look like you know al</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.510" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">Han musk I are our arcs have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.880" end="00:45:39.240" style="s2">similarity to including failed marriages</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:39.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.360" end="00:45:42.820" style="s2">Silicon Valley is littered with these</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:44.260" style="s2">kinds of kids because Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.820" end="00:45:48.550" style="s2">figured out that that particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.260" end="00:45:49.930" style="s2">typology fits a particular niche back in</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.550" end="00:45:51.580" style="s2">the early days of Silicon Valley they</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.930" end="00:45:53.370" style="s2">were like there remember they were like</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.580" end="00:45:54.910" style="s2">coming out of World War two and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.370" end="00:45:56.500" style="s2">recognizing that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.910" end="00:45:58.750" style="s2">about technology that was important and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.500" end="00:46:00.250" style="s2">powerful and trying to figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.750" end="00:46:02.500" style="s2">okay how do we do this better with like</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.250" end="00:46:04.660" style="s2">IBM was the East Coast you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.500" end="00:46:06.850" style="s2">archetype so they come over to the West</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.660" end="00:46:08.080" style="s2">Coast and they start experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.850" end="00:46:12.030" style="s2">different approaches on how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.080" end="00:46:14.080" style="s2">do this technology innovation thing and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.030" end="00:46:16.030" style="s2">here they start getting these archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.080" end="00:46:17.260" style="s2">where I just have used Steve Jobs as an</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.030" end="00:46:18.340" style="s2">example it&#39;s a little bit late in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.260" end="00:46:20.500" style="s2">curve and then that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.340" end="00:46:23.590" style="s2">example of a particular kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.500" end="00:46:26.040" style="s2">who had these skills these capacities in</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.590" end="00:46:28.570" style="s2">the capacity to to have this vast</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.040" end="00:46:30.490" style="s2">imaginal space of all the possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.570" end="00:46:32.740" style="s2">of what technologies could be combined</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.490" end="00:46:34.210" style="s2">into to create a particular effect in</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.740" end="00:46:36.430" style="s2">his case he had kind of a design</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.210" end="00:46:37.420" style="s2">marketing version of it so he was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.430" end="00:46:38.830" style="s2">it from the point of view of something</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.420" end="00:46:40.390" style="s2">to be sexy that other people do</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.830" end="00:46:43.740" style="s2">interesting to get because it&#39;s a kid he</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.390" end="00:46:46.150" style="s2">had a lot of conman experienced and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.740" end="00:46:48.490" style="s2">grifter experience so that was part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.150" end="00:46:50.710" style="s2">his developmental skillset but you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.490" end="00:46:51.910" style="s2">was the act was his key partner in crime</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.710" end="00:46:53.770" style="s2">in the beginning there was niak was</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.910" end="00:46:55.270" style="s2">coming at it from more the kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.770" end="00:46:57.340" style="s2">systems design and seeing how these</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.270" end="00:46:58.900" style="s2">things were possible and Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.340" end="00:47:02.380" style="s2">is like oh wow okay I get it</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.900" end="00:47:03.580" style="s2">these kind of really weird low EQ like</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.380" end="00:47:04.870" style="s2">when I&#39;m talking to him I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.580" end="00:47:06.370" style="s2">getting the facial expressions that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.870" end="00:47:09.550" style="s2">indicate that they&#39;re human being</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.370" end="00:47:11.230" style="s2">sometimes kids they&#39;re the ones who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.550" end="00:47:13.030" style="s2">the peak predator in this niche okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.230" end="00:47:16.300" style="s2">cool I need to optimize for that I need</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.030" end="00:47:17.920" style="s2">to get more find a way to make them more</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.300" end="00:47:19.720" style="s2">effective so how do I put them in</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.920" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">constructs that either incentivize them</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.720" end="00:47:22.570" style="s2">to do things that they don&#39;t want like</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:25.150" style="s2">to do naturally they have to like talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.570" end="00:47:26.830" style="s2">to other people and work with people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.150" end="00:47:28.210" style="s2">have collaborative skill sets and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.830" end="00:47:30.280" style="s2">this stuff like it figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.210" end="00:47:32.590" style="s2">create a construct that super empower</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.280" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">these particular individuals so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.590" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">what I was saying is that in the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:37.590" style="s2">that I found myself attracted to and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:40.570" style="s2">frankly it&#39;s still attracted to because</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.590" end="00:47:42.370" style="s2">if I can earn this weird capacity</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.570" end="00:47:44.890" style="s2">through all kinds of tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.370" end="00:47:47.170" style="s2">sacrifice online in part and the people</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.890" end="00:47:48.910" style="s2">who I care about and it&#39;ll be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.170" end="00:47:52.660" style="s2">able to put to use so the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.910" end="00:47:53.710" style="s2">see vast complex systems and see all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.660" end="00:47:57.010" style="s2">pieces fit together</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.710" end="00:47:58.570" style="s2">- notice how subtle shifts in science</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.010" end="00:48:00.460" style="s2">can be shifted in technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.570" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">could disrupt certain characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.460" end="00:48:05.560" style="s2">the system to shift things in a big way</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">is attractive to me because I can do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.560" end="00:48:08.500" style="s2">and it would be nice to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:09.970" style="s2">it&#39;s useful but in any event what I&#39;d do</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.500" end="00:48:11.619" style="s2">if I go into that space is that I find</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.970" end="00:48:15.820" style="s2">myself a whole lot of other folks who</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.619" end="00:48:18.070" style="s2">are somewhat similarly disabled and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.820" end="00:48:19.900" style="s2">noticed that particularly over the past</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.070" end="00:48:21.700" style="s2">decade and a half unless you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.900" end="00:48:22.869" style="s2">the Silicon Valley game straight down</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.700" end="00:48:28.300" style="s2">the middle so unless you like build an</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.869" end="00:48:31.900" style="s2">uber or Facebook or snapchat that</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.300" end="00:48:34.690" style="s2">particular typology is new is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.900" end="00:48:37.060" style="s2">actually the right typology for building</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.690" end="00:48:39.300" style="s2">this next kind of thing mmm it throws</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.060" end="00:48:42.970" style="s2">too many errors they can&#39;t collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.300" end="00:48:46.270" style="s2">anywhere near as well as is necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.970" end="00:48:47.770" style="s2">build game B for example so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.270" end="00:48:50.260" style="s2">I was trying to say in that Twitter that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.770" end="00:48:57.730" style="s2">you know 50 said it like nine Langara</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.260" end="00:48:59.170" style="s2">tours all right right yeah mmm I could</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.730" end="00:49:00.430" style="s2">respond to this or we could look we</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.170" end="00:49:03.220" style="s2">could pop over to the YouTube page and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.430" end="00:49:06.580" style="s2">yeah like that there&#39;s something going</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.220" end="00:49:12.359" style="s2">on there that feels good okay cool okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.580" end="00:49:12.359" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at the YouTube chat box now</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:19.990" style="s2">let&#39;s see hmm this is the first live</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.820" end="00:49:22.359" style="s2">stream ever done actually I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.990" end="00:49:23.800" style="s2">realized me too me too if I do this</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.359" end="00:49:25.240" style="s2">there are people who are perceiving it</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.800" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">in real time that I happen I have no</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.240" end="00:49:29.770" style="s2">idea who they are correct yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:31.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a 20 second delay - oh well the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.770" end="00:49:33.990" style="s2">proceeding in 15 seconds from now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.810" end="00:49:33.990" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.310" end="00:49:47.190" style="s2">okay I&#39;m just gonna read a read the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.720" end="00:49:57.540" style="s2">first comment that I see see what</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.190" end="00:49:59.400" style="s2">happens here if you consider the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.540" end="00:50:02.970" style="s2">different functions of money unit of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.400" end="00:50:04.980" style="s2">exchange store value fungible etc does</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.970" end="00:50:10.260" style="s2">not need all of these features anymore</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.980" end="00:50:12.540" style="s2">we have computers for trust that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.260" end="00:50:16.140" style="s2">a little snippet I sort of chose at</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.540" end="00:50:19.080" style="s2">random is anything interesting in there</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.140" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">that you want to okay yeah sure let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.080" end="00:50:22.020" style="s2">pop that open so it took me a while to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:23.430" style="s2">actually process it because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.020" end="00:50:24.870" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been thinking that for a long</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.430" end="00:50:27.540" style="s2">time so I just need to think okay what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.870" end="00:50:30.360" style="s2">hmm maybe obvious to me but is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.540" end="00:50:32.760" style="s2">not common knowledge so the first piece</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.360" end="00:50:37.710" style="s2">is to recognize that the thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.760" end="00:50:40.590" style="s2">call money has a bundle of function that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.710" end="00:50:43.550" style="s2">it tends to bundle together mm-hmm so it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.590" end="00:50:45.810" style="s2">bundles things like unit of account and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.550" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">it bundles things like medium of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.810" end="00:50:49.740" style="s2">exchange and store values of things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">in economics is the way they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.740" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.080" end="00:50:54.990" style="s2">I should mention some other ones by the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.700" end="00:50:56.970" style="s2">way just as long as we&#39;re at it because</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.990" end="00:50:58.740" style="s2">because the key the key thing what about</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.970" end="00:51:00.270" style="s2">to say is we can we can decouple we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.740" end="00:51:01.830" style="s2">we can unbundle these things and think</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.270" end="00:51:03.990" style="s2">about them as not necessarily having to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.830" end="00:51:05.100" style="s2">be part of the same cost or I should</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.990" end="00:51:07.860" style="s2">mention by the way that had a meta-level</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.100" end="00:51:09.780" style="s2">in terms of ethics bundling and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.860" end="00:51:12.860" style="s2">unbundling is a massive consideration</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.780" end="00:51:17.310" style="s2">and the notion for example that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.860" end="00:51:18.450" style="s2">bundle what&#39;s one we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.310" end="00:51:20.130" style="s2">well this is maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.450" end="00:51:22.650" style="s2">challenging but the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.130" end="00:51:25.230" style="s2">recently in California getting vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.650" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">and going to school have been bundled is</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.230" end="00:51:28.230" style="s2">an ethical quandary because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:29.490" style="s2">naturally belong together like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.230" end="00:51:31.650" style="s2">no reason for them to be together other</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.490" end="00:51:33.450" style="s2">than the fact that because people want</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.650" end="00:51:35.240" style="s2">to go to school if we bundle vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.450" end="00:51:37.080" style="s2">with school now vaccines is upregulated</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.240" end="00:51:38.730" style="s2">but the same thing happens like with</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.080" end="00:51:40.140" style="s2">cable companies they don&#39;t you know if</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.730" end="00:51:41.490" style="s2">you want to get ESPN you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.140" end="00:51:42.840" style="s2">get Disney or whatever if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.490" end="00:51:44.820" style="s2">get Internet you have to pay for TV like</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.840" end="00:51:46.740" style="s2">bundling things to its enormous amounts</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.820" end="00:51:49.650" style="s2">of ethical quandary because it takes</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.740" end="00:51:50.730" style="s2">people&#39;s choices away so maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.650" end="00:51:53.990" style="s2">even part of the implication here is</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.730" end="00:51:53.990" style="s2">that because money has</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.140" end="00:51:58.860" style="s2">bundles lots of things together they</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.980" end="00:52:00.660" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily need to be bundled it</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.860" end="00:52:01.830" style="s2">creates an ethical quandary because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.660" end="00:52:03.840" style="s2">takes people&#39;s choices away and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.830" end="00:52:06.600" style="s2">we&#39;re now in a moment where we could</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.840" end="00:52:08.660" style="s2">begin to unbundle them in more and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.600" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">act akahl which is to say more choice</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.660" end="00:52:12.390" style="s2">enhancing ways so the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:16.830" style="s2">I was going to mention that are bundled</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.390" end="00:52:22.290" style="s2">are if you look at the way that we that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.830" end="00:52:23.580" style="s2">we use money in in the economy it does a</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.290" end="00:52:26.970" style="s2">bunch of different things simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.580" end="00:52:29.300" style="s2">and this is a big reason why it would</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.970" end="00:52:37.020" style="s2">kind of get selected for as a convergent</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.300" end="00:52:42.990" style="s2">attractor so the the price gives me an</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.020" end="00:52:45.570" style="s2">orientation towards where I might orient</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.990" end="00:52:48.260" style="s2">my or spend my time so if I look at say</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.570" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">wages as a price signal the price signal</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.260" end="00:52:54.780" style="s2">that job which will pay me the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:55.800" style="s2">money and that I can get maybe is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.780" end="00:52:57.540" style="s2">best the thing that I should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.800" end="00:53:00.870" style="s2">right the most value that I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.540" end="00:53:02.370" style="s2">contribute to the economy by hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.870" end="00:53:04.590" style="s2">is that job which will pay me the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.370" end="00:53:07.560" style="s2">money and that I can also get that I can</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.590" end="00:53:10.310" style="s2">qualify for so the the price signal</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.560" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">helps us orient our time and attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.310" end="00:53:14.640" style="s2">towards those those activities of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:16.110" style="s2">most valuable that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.640" end="00:53:17.580" style="s2">important like super hard like at this</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.110" end="00:53:20.070" style="s2">very moment what conversation I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.580" end="00:53:21.120" style="s2">having I&#39;m talking with you is this the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.070" end="00:53:23.310" style="s2">right one are you and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.120" end="00:53:25.230" style="s2">spending our time optimally but</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.310" end="00:53:27.330" style="s2">economics would say is that if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.230" end="00:53:28.860" style="s2">price signal every single choice that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.330" end="00:53:30.090" style="s2">made was guided by a price signal I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.860" end="00:53:31.740" style="s2">could just look out there have like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.090" end="00:53:33.960" style="s2">bunch of bid-ask markets for my</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.740" end="00:53:35.610" style="s2">particular podcast time whichever</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.960" end="00:53:36.690" style="s2">bid-ask market had the highest price by</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.610" end="00:53:38.040" style="s2">definition would be the place where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.690" end="00:53:39.720" style="s2">giving the most vile is everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.040" end="00:53:40.530" style="s2">paying to the minutes of podcasts and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.720" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the ones the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.530" end="00:53:44.970" style="s2">important so that&#39;s one piece right</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:47.130" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece and this it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.970" end="00:53:51.120" style="s2">powerful because it&#39;s simple yet</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.130" end="00:53:52.920" style="s2">universal meaning whether it&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.120" end="00:53:54.830" style="s2">on a podcast we&#39;re making an asparagus</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.920" end="00:53:57.750" style="s2">and whether it&#39;s me or it&#39;s somebody in</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.830" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">Zimbabwe the price signal can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.750" end="00:54:05.720" style="s2">slow through all those things but it</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:05.720" style="s2">also does things like</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:12.660" style="s2">orient it&#39;s actually how we go about</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.440" end="00:54:15.120" style="s2">allocating resources so not just how do</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.660" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">we personally like how do I get my</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.120" end="00:54:20.010" style="s2">choice is activated out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:22.590" style="s2">it&#39;s also through money and so I am</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.010" end="00:54:24.330" style="s2">oriented towards how I choose to attend</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.590" end="00:54:27.150" style="s2">my time and energy what work will I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.330" end="00:54:28.590" style="s2">to give value to the whole but also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.150" end="00:54:30.750" style="s2">telling the whole what value I want them</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.590" end="00:54:32.940" style="s2">to give me and these two things match so</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.750" end="00:54:35.310" style="s2">if I&#39;ve got you know $10 I put those 10</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.940" end="00:54:37.290" style="s2">dollars on a new iPhone then the entire</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.310" end="00:54:39.600" style="s2">economy is like iPhones are better let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.290" end="00:54:41.010" style="s2">be doing more of that good $10 on orange</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.600" end="00:54:43.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the entire economy shifts to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.010" end="00:54:48.180" style="s2">oranges and more importantly terms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.950" end="00:54:50.010" style="s2">ethics if I say I want to is it organic</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.180" end="00:54:51.930" style="s2">orange as opposed to a pesticide Orange</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.010" end="00:54:53.310" style="s2">then in principle that signal percolates</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.930" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">out and there&#39;s some shift in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.310" end="00:54:59.310" style="s2">choice field towards slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:55:02.460" style="s2">organic ish this is a lot of noise in</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.310" end="00:55:03.690" style="s2">the total attenuated signal but then</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.460" end="00:55:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s also incentives it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.690" end="00:55:06.750" style="s2">orientation it&#39;s incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.800" end="00:55:08.370" style="s2">motivation like well you know okay the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.750" end="00:55:09.390" style="s2">entire value field is telling me that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.370" end="00:55:10.950" style="s2">should be a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.390" end="00:55:12.180" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s you know what we pay me the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.950" end="00:55:13.800" style="s2">most money and that I can get I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.180" end="00:55:16.380" style="s2">qualify for but I don&#39;t want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.800" end="00:55:18.210" style="s2">doctor being a doctor sucks right but</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.380" end="00:55:19.800" style="s2">nope that&#39;s your motivation your</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.210" end="00:55:21.630" style="s2">incentive and here&#39;s the trade-off do</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.800" end="00:55:23.730" style="s2">something that you think sucks you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.630" end="00:55:25.980" style="s2">are interested in make a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.730" end="00:55:27.690" style="s2">and then you get more choice making to</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.980" end="00:55:30.540" style="s2">get the things that you want say that</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.690" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">little loop right there which of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.540" end="00:55:34.020" style="s2">we&#39;re all familiar with that trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:35.430" style="s2">I&#39;ll go be an investment banker do</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.020" end="00:55:37.230" style="s2">really bad things make a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.430" end="00:55:39.510" style="s2">and then get whatever I want which tends</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.230" end="00:55:42.750" style="s2">to also be interesting enough vapid and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.510" end="00:55:45.240" style="s2">not fulfilling but they&#39;ve got another</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.750" end="00:55:48.140" style="s2">one which is really interesting at a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.240" end="00:55:50.760" style="s2">higher level we had this hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.140" end="00:55:54.570" style="s2">the collective allocation of resources</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.760" end="00:55:57.270" style="s2">that are being created by this bimodal</p>

<p begin="00:55:57.270" end="00:56:01.950" style="s2">my time and attention by the price</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.530" end="00:56:05.210" style="s2">signal and how I&#39;m getting what I want</p>

<p begin="00:58:17.540" end="00:58:19.910" style="s2">because it bundles all those things</p>

<p begin="00:58:23.870" end="00:58:26.930" style="s2">together and it&#39;s really hard to pull</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:30.970" style="s2">them apart because they&#39;re part of this</p>

<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:25.730" style="s2">us make sense of those values as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.859" end="00:59:29.930" style="s2">to all these things that are bundled</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.730" end="00:59:31.670" style="s2">together so yes by the way challenge it</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.930" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not obvious exactly how you do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.670" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">and most efforts in that direction have</p>

<p begin="00:59:42.619" end="00:59:49.700" style="s2">this sort that are sort of obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.030" end="00:59:52.520" style="s2">successful Amazon and Yelp ratings so</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.700" end="00:59:54.980" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to find out how to most fully</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.520" end="00:59:56.630" style="s2">satisfy my desire to have a really good</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.980" end="00:59:57.010" style="s2">book or having a good meal a good cup of</p>

<p begin="00:59:57.010" end="01:00:00.800" style="s2">well one mechanism might might use is</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.240" end="01:00:02.660" style="s2">the price signal I might look for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.800" end="01:00:04.250" style="s2">most expensive book most expensive book</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.660" end="01:00:06.349" style="s2">but I can afford looking at say okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.250" end="01:00:09.470" style="s2">this book&#39;s $30 I&#39;ve only want to spend</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.349" end="01:00:10.940" style="s2">20 20 go that&#39;s the price signal trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.470" end="01:00:13.730" style="s2">to help me orient my time and attention</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.940" end="01:00:15.650" style="s2">efficiently but of course that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.730" end="01:00:19.150" style="s2">a shitty signal it&#39;s obviously terrible</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.650" end="01:00:21.500" style="s2">so Amazon signal of ratings and reviews</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.150" end="01:00:23.089" style="s2">radically increases my capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.500" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">process that information space and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.089" end="01:00:28.069" style="s2">might notice really shift the price</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:30.440" style="s2">signal no so if I have a book is trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.069" end="01:00:31.640" style="s2">to sell itself for 30 bucks and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.440" end="01:00:33.020" style="s2">another book that&#39;s sort of roughly in</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.640" end="01:00:35.210" style="s2">the same domain so they&#39;re comparable</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.020" end="01:00:36.349" style="s2">and ones that one star wants a five star</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.210" end="01:00:38.329" style="s2">the one star&#39;s not going to sell it all</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.349" end="01:00:40.220" style="s2">zero did everyone this five star is</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.329" end="01:00:41.569" style="s2">gonna sell can&#39;t take all the man so the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.220" end="01:00:43.190" style="s2">price signal something it&#39;s shifted and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.569" end="01:00:45.349" style="s2">this one either just goes away or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.190" end="01:00:47.360" style="s2">price has to go down more more clearly</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.349" end="01:00:49.280" style="s2">the case in yellow I said I&#39;ve got five</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.360" end="01:00:51.320" style="s2">gunshots and one of the coffee shops has</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.280" end="01:00:53.330" style="s2">five stars and each one has like going</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.320" end="01:00:54.530" style="s2">down coffee shop with three stars if</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.330" end="01:00:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s for charity turning exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.530" end="01:00:58.670" style="s2">same price it&#39;s gonna be getting much</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.720" end="01:00:59.990" style="s2">less sales yeah so this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.670" end="01:01:02.150" style="s2">completely different information</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.990" end="01:01:04.010" style="s2">signaling mechanism the currency in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.150" end="01:01:06.940" style="s2">case in the form of a review or a star</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.010" end="01:01:09.050" style="s2">rating that is not money and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.940" end="01:01:10.460" style="s2">meaningfully changes our capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.050" end="01:01:13.820" style="s2">make effective choices and getting our</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.460" end="01:01:16.490" style="s2">are our needs fulfilled and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.820" end="01:01:18.590" style="s2">also has direct real measurable</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.490" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">implications for the price signal</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.590" end="01:01:22.430" style="s2">affecting money so we can be very very</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:24.860" style="s2">clever about that we can begin to think</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.430" end="01:01:26.090" style="s2">about modulating different forms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.860" end="01:01:27.410" style="s2">currencies including little bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.090" end="01:01:29.030" style="s2">different forms of money that have</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:36.920" style="s2">ones and there&#39;s you know hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.910" end="01:01:39.170" style="s2">millions of other variations and see</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.920" end="01:01:43.210" style="s2">what kinds of consequences does have so</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.170" end="01:01:43.210" style="s2">what I have to say about that hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.310" end="01:01:48.760" style="s2">another question that I want to ask you</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.810" end="01:01:57.470" style="s2">someone threw it on the group was um</p>

<p begin="01:02:24.200" end="01:02:26.870" style="s2">at peak predator feels a little off and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.550" end="01:02:28.460" style="s2">I think that&#39;s yep that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.870" end="01:02:31.250" style="s2">characteristic yeah my notion if</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.460" end="01:02:35.660" style="s2">something feels off like a basic</p>

<p begin="01:02:35.660" end="01:02:39.890" style="s2">feeling there&#39;s aesthetic discernment an</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.810" end="01:02:44.900" style="s2">orientation towards aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.890" end="01:02:46.640" style="s2">discernment meaning a basal capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.900" end="01:02:49.610" style="s2">attend to building skillfulness and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.640" end="01:02:51.500" style="s2">using that modality to make choices that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.610" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">would be a primary characteristic</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.500" end="01:02:55.820" style="s2">because this particular modality is</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:57.650" style="s2">increasingly meaningful increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.820" end="01:02:59.540" style="s2">important for example in navigating</p>

<p begin="01:02:59.540" end="01:03:04.310" style="s2">complexity using analytical</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.090" end="01:03:06.220" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have a very bad day if</p>

<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:11.660" style="s2">better day by the way it still not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.490" end="01:03:14.920" style="s2">be an awesome day because complexity is</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.660" end="01:03:18.020" style="s2">complex but it could be a much better</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.920" end="01:03:19.070" style="s2">here&#39;s another one I called this and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.020" end="01:03:22.940" style="s2">don&#39;t think it really landed I called</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.070" end="01:03:25.400" style="s2">infinitesimal courage so the story there</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.940" end="01:03:27.080" style="s2">was something like an inquiry into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.400" end="01:03:29.960" style="s2">nature of courage itself what is courage</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.080" end="01:03:31.970" style="s2">and one of the things that I noticed was</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.960" end="01:03:34.880" style="s2">that at least I proposed so who knows</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.970" end="01:03:36.680" style="s2">that this is vaguely valid but I propose</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:37.700" style="s2">that courage was an instant a simple</p>

<p begin="01:03:37.700" end="01:03:45.260" style="s2">of the fact that it was discovered in</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.590" end="01:06:16.280" style="s2">is very outward facing but we find that</p>

<p begin="01:06:27.830" end="01:06:32.240" style="s2">there that we can you know gear up for</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.560" end="01:06:34.220" style="s2">old-school courage to go out and combat</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.240" end="01:06:35.450" style="s2">precisely to distract ourselves from</p>

<p begin="01:10:46.440" end="01:10:51.300" style="s2">right now as you&#39;re listening to me</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.060" end="01:10:54.000" style="s2">spew nonsense out of my mouth to what</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.300" end="01:10:54.600" style="s2">degree are you able to just separate the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.000" end="01:10:57.150" style="s2">signal from the noise</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.600" end="01:10:58.620" style="s2">like if you&#39;re rejecting what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.150" end="01:11:00.330" style="s2">because some of its noise then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.620" end="01:11:01.320" style="s2">wasting everybody&#39;s time if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.330" end="01:11:02.310" style="s2">rejecting what I&#39;m saying because some</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.320" end="01:11:04.170" style="s2">of this noise and then you actually take</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.310" end="01:11:06.540" style="s2">the time to write that down on YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.170" end="01:11:08.100" style="s2">you&#39;re wasting even more time but if</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.540" end="01:11:09.060" style="s2">you&#39;re able to say okay look nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.100" end="01:11:10.230" style="s2">gonna be telling the whole truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.060" end="01:11:11.850" style="s2">in fact almost everybody&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.230" end="01:11:14.880" style="s2"> a lot because it&#39;s hard not to</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.850" end="01:11:16.170" style="s2">people to I&#39;m gonna listen and</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.880" end="01:11:17.910" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna throw away the parts that</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.170" end="01:11:19.440" style="s2">are noise and take the parts to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.910" end="01:11:20.820" style="s2">signal and that&#39;s that that&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.440" end="01:11:23.040" style="s2">these relationships work all right so</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.820" end="01:11:25.260" style="s2">that that&#39;s like three levels that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.040" end="01:11:26.880" style="s2">just went through right one level is not</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.260" end="01:11:28.620" style="s2">to be so fully reactive that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.880" end="01:11:31.560" style="s2">actually waste your own time reacting</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.620" end="01:11:33.570" style="s2">and then expressing your reaction not to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.560" end="01:11:35.130" style="s2">be reactive but then to actually just</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.570" end="01:11:36.810" style="s2">learn that that&#39;s just you that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.130" end="01:11:38.730" style="s2">the world we&#39;re in or your real world</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.810" end="01:11:41.370" style="s2">where you need to learn how to listen</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.730" end="01:11:43.590" style="s2">and pull that signal which is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.370" end="01:11:45.210" style="s2">that is nutritive for you throw away the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.590" end="01:11:46.980" style="s2">noise and then and that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.210" end="01:11:50.550" style="s2">first move and then the second move is</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.980" end="01:11:52.230" style="s2">then how do you bring more signal back</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.550" end="01:11:53.610" style="s2">into the world and I may not be in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.230" end="01:11:55.320" style="s2">conversation I may be in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.610" end="01:11:56.349" style="s2">conversation you hear what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.320" end="01:11:58.030" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.349" end="01:11:59.889" style="s2">Jordan like 85% we just said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.030" end="01:12:01.630" style="s2"> it&#39;s 15% sounds pretty good so</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.889" end="01:12:03.460" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s focus on that and it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.630" end="01:12:05.320" style="s2">regulate that and get that to like 45%</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.460" end="01:12:06.520" style="s2">can we do that and here&#39;s how I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.320" end="01:12:08.949" style="s2">try to contribute right so you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.520" end="01:12:09.909" style="s2">using your discernment in expression and</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.949" end="01:12:10.810" style="s2">adding something back into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.909" end="01:12:12.760" style="s2">conversation which makes the</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.810" end="01:12:14.889" style="s2">conversation even richer for us and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.760" end="01:12:16.179" style="s2">anybody else who perceives it or you</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.889" end="01:12:17.889" style="s2">might just bring it into other</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.179" end="01:12:19.150" style="s2">conversations could be anywhere right</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.889" end="01:12:20.770" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing that signal back into</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.150" end="01:12:22.750" style="s2">the world isn&#39;t that exactly where it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.770" end="01:12:25.570" style="s2">as long as it is an increase in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.750" end="01:12:28.630" style="s2">overall signal in the world hmm but I</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.570" end="01:12:31.860" style="s2">was talking to a woman I think Romanian</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.630" end="01:12:34.780" style="s2">descent who now lives in Germany named</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.860" end="01:12:37.329" style="s2">Alex Alex s I think who&#39;s what she told</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.780" end="01:12:38.949" style="s2">me to call her or how to name her and</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.329" end="01:12:41.230" style="s2">she was telling me about a ritual that</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.949" end="01:12:43.989" style="s2">she loved when she was a child I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.230" end="01:12:46.840" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the Orthodox religion and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.989" end="01:12:49.540" style="s2">Eastern and the way that it worked was I</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.840" end="01:12:52.179" style="s2">mean I I don&#39;t I&#39;m just gonna tell the</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.540" end="01:12:53.560" style="s2">story the way I have probably</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.179" end="01:12:54.940" style="s2">embellished it so I&#39;m probably not</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.560" end="01:12:58.420" style="s2">telling you the truth I&#39;m telling you a</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.940" end="01:12:59.829" style="s2">story that landed for me that is largely</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.420" end="01:13:02.260" style="s2">based about what she actually told me</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.829" end="01:13:04.420" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll toss out the yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.260" end="01:13:06.280" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.420" end="01:13:11.290" style="s2">exactly perfect now we&#39;re friends I plan</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.280" end="01:13:13.829" style="s2">we&#39;re playing together so midnight on</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.290" end="01:13:17.920" style="s2">Easter the lights are out it&#39;s dark</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.829" end="01:13:20.050" style="s2">candles are lit at churches people come</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.920" end="01:13:22.030" style="s2">with candles unlit candles they come to</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.050" end="01:13:23.320" style="s2">the church they light their candle they</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.030" end="01:13:25.420" style="s2">come out of the church they walk down</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.320" end="01:13:27.099" style="s2">the street if you encounter somebody on</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.420" end="01:13:29.800" style="s2">the street with an unlit candle you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.099" end="01:13:33.579" style="s2">a lit candle it is sort of the thing to</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.800" end="01:13:35.800" style="s2">do to light their candles your candle so</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.579" end="01:13:38.619" style="s2">in the beginning the source of light is</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.800" end="01:13:40.659" style="s2">at the church very quickly the</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.619" end="01:13:42.579" style="s2">overwhelming source of light is just</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.659" end="01:13:45.159" style="s2">people in your community who are walking</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.579" end="01:13:46.599" style="s2">through the streets and if you just by</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.159" end="01:13:48.550" style="s2">the way do the math on this it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.599" end="01:13:50.409" style="s2">be a very steep exponential curve right</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.550" end="01:13:51.760" style="s2">so for a while there&#39;s only a few people</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.409" end="01:13:54.219" style="s2">who have walked into churches that their</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.760" end="01:13:55.869" style="s2">candles were walking out but as they</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.219" end="01:13:57.550" style="s2">encounter somebody with a unlit candle</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.869" end="01:13:58.929" style="s2">and they lighted the number of lit</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.550" end="01:13:59.860" style="s2">candles begins to increase the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.929" end="01:14:02.290" style="s2">probability of an unlit candle</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.860" end="01:14:04.270" style="s2">encountering a lit candle increases and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.290" end="01:14:06.150" style="s2">you get an explosion and now the whole</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.270" end="01:14:07.900" style="s2">town is lit by these candles of</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.150" end="01:14:10.030" style="s2">relationships that people actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.900" end="01:14:11.800" style="s2">encountering each other and these thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.030" end="01:14:13.300" style="s2">the metaphor because the signal noise</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.800" end="01:14:17.380" style="s2">metaphor is very similar to the light</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.300" end="01:14:20.290" style="s2">heat metaphor in thermodynamics so one</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.380" end="01:14:22.360" style="s2">thing is to become in yourself so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.290" end="01:14:24.790" style="s2">now I&#39;m using the metaphor the this</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.360" end="01:14:26.770" style="s2">capacity that we&#39;re exploring is to</p>

<p begin="01:14:26.770" end="01:14:33.430" style="s2">that when exposed to heat can become</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.280" end="01:14:36.160" style="s2">light and produce light oh don&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.430" end="01:14:37.450" style="s2">wet a green stick right where I can put</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.160" end="01:14:39.160" style="s2">a lot of heat on you nothing comes out</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.450" end="01:14:41.530" style="s2">except for maybe acrid smoke don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.160" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">that become a candle we&#39;re just to not</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.530" end="01:14:47.260" style="s2">too much heat combustion light and by</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.560" end="01:14:48.820" style="s2">the way it gives off more heat so now</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.260" end="01:14:52.390" style="s2">what happens is become candle is one</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.820" end="01:14:53.830" style="s2">thing then seek the light as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.390" end="01:14:54.670" style="s2">walking around you&#39;ve become candle and</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.830" end="01:14:56.920" style="s2">you seek the light</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.670" end="01:14:58.990" style="s2">seek the light find the light when you</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.920" end="01:15:00.910" style="s2">find the light come close enough to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.990" end="01:15:03.010" style="s2">light that you yourself have become a</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.910" end="01:15:05.980" style="s2">source of light when you&#39;re a source of</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.010" end="01:15:07.780" style="s2">light share that light as you see other</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.980" end="01:15:09.400" style="s2">people who are becoming candle share</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.780" end="01:15:11.830" style="s2">whatever light you have which actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.400" end="01:15:14.140" style="s2">means also sharing heat to help them</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.830" end="01:15:15.610" style="s2">combust but it&#39;s through the signal of</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.140" end="01:15:17.320" style="s2">light to traction able to perceive that</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.610" end="01:15:18.490" style="s2">relationship at the end of the day you</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.320" end="01:15:20.290" style="s2">don&#39;t want you don&#39;t want to melt their</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.490" end="01:15:21.730" style="s2">candle you don&#39;t it&#39;s like hold your</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.290" end="01:15:23.410" style="s2">candle near their candle so just melts</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.730" end="01:15:26.440" style="s2">you actually want to turn that heat into</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.410" end="01:15:28.330" style="s2">light Oh enlighten them and if enough</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.440" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">people become candles and enough people</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.330" end="01:15:32.860" style="s2">seek the light and that people share the</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:35.050" style="s2">light skilfully then you get an</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.860" end="01:15:37.240" style="s2">explosion an exponential explosion that</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.050" end="01:15:39.580" style="s2">starts flow but if and maybe in certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.240" end="01:15:41.350" style="s2">locations certain individuals or places</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.580" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">or places where the first candles are</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.350" end="01:15:44.470" style="s2">lit but eventually more and more and</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:47.380" style="s2">more of the candles are actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.470" end="01:15:50.110" style="s2">happening from the community and then it</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.380" end="01:15:52.570" style="s2">becomes everyone hmm are you just trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.110" end="01:15:53.260" style="s2">to get me to accept Jesus Christ as my</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.570" end="01:15:56.290" style="s2">Lord and Savior</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.260" end="01:15:57.550" style="s2">haha if you will decide to Orthodox is</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.290" end="01:15:59.170" style="s2">your thing then definitely you should do</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.550" end="01:16:01.450" style="s2">that it&#39;d be a very weird choice to</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.170" end="01:16:03.940" style="s2">become a Eastern Orthodox and not accept</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.450" end="01:16:05.530" style="s2">Jesus Christ but I imagine there are</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.940" end="01:16:08.920" style="s2">other metaphors that can be employed no</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.530" end="01:16:11.080" style="s2">it&#39;s beautiful one thing one other thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.920" end="01:16:16.050" style="s2">that I want to ask you is about oh man I</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.080" end="01:16:21.420" style="s2">should reduce how much time do you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.050" end="01:16:21.420" style="s2">10 more minutes ok 10 more minutes ok</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.810" end="01:16:25.650" style="s2">generative</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.590" end="01:16:30.070" style="s2">collective&#39;s what did you say generative</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.650" end="01:16:32.230" style="s2">something it was like tribes generative</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.070" end="01:16:34.210" style="s2">tribes one of the things you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.230" end="01:16:37.150" style="s2">about social media was people constantly</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.210" end="01:16:38.830" style="s2">signaling in group non generative tribes</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.150" end="01:16:39.880" style="s2">action is what I said and so the inverse</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.830" end="01:16:41.650" style="s2">that would be a generative tribe yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.880" end="01:16:44.050" style="s2">want to I want to point to the inverse</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.650" end="01:16:45.880" style="s2">of it so okay I&#39;ve been thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.050" end="01:16:48.429" style="s2">about like what what makes up a</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.880" end="01:16:51.659" style="s2">generative tribe and yeah and like</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.429" end="01:16:55.810" style="s2">wanting to out like outsource and</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.659" end="01:16:59.679" style="s2">experiment in in creating a tribe&#39;</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.810" end="01:17:01.810" style="s2">degenerative in nature and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.679" end="01:17:05.639" style="s2">what that looks like yet I&#39;m just sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.810" end="01:17:09.659" style="s2">of like hovering around that idea and I</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.639" end="01:17:09.659" style="s2">wonder if you have any thoughts about</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.929" end="01:17:15.219" style="s2">yeah boy do it it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s you it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:18.040" style="s2">huge topic and it&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.219" end="01:17:19.659" style="s2">depend on like this particular tribes</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.040" end="01:17:25.020" style="s2">disposition what their work is in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.659" end="01:17:28.360" style="s2">world but just in the spirit of like</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.020" end="01:17:30.400" style="s2">shining a light in that direction do you</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.360" end="01:17:33.820" style="s2">have any ideas of groups that are doing</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.400" end="01:17:37.150" style="s2">something something like this or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.820" end="01:17:38.409" style="s2">just your own thoughts of how you could</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.150" end="01:17:41.380" style="s2">see that being a potentially valuable</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.409" end="01:17:43.060" style="s2">exercise I know that&#39;s the only looking</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.380" end="01:17:44.920" style="s2">huge question when you say groups are</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.060" end="01:17:47.110" style="s2">doing something too like this what was</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.920" end="01:17:52.449" style="s2">the this was you&#39;re pointing yet I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.110" end="01:17:56.889" style="s2">it&#39;s like um tribes that are groups that</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.449" end="01:17:59.830" style="s2">are experimenting with with collective</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.889" end="01:18:03.250" style="s2">coherence so maybe it&#39;s a start up maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.830" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">for experimenting with generativity yes</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.250" end="01:18:07.119" style="s2">so they&#39;re not so there at least at</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:10.030" style="s2">least they&#39;re conscious they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.119" end="01:18:12.190" style="s2">consciously aware of the possibility and</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.030" end="01:18:15.820" style="s2">maybe importance of we might call</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.190" end="01:18:17.830" style="s2">technologies of generativity in what</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.820" end="01:18:19.239" style="s2">they are doing and they may they may be</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.830" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">just that that may be all they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.239" end="01:18:22.420" style="s2">let&#39;s just do that or they may be saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:23.889" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do X but what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.420" end="01:18:24.940" style="s2">expert are also be mindful of this like</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.889" end="01:18:29.139" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.940" end="01:18:31.480" style="s2">yeah so yeah yeah there&#39;s a an</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.139" end="01:18:32.380" style="s2">increasingly large number it was</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.480" end="01:18:35.619" style="s2">interesting actually now that I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.380" end="01:18:36.239" style="s2">about it is that they seem to come from</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.619" end="01:18:43.199" style="s2">a number of</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.239" end="01:18:44.699" style="s2">different qualitative alright well</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.199" end="01:18:46.559" style="s2">different kinds of approaches to</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.699" end="01:18:50.159" style="s2">addressing that problem so I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.559" end="01:18:55.260" style="s2">an example one approach we might think</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.159" end="01:18:57.480" style="s2">of as being architectural so I was</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.260" end="01:18:59.639" style="s2">talking to a guy named Oliver Sauter I</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.480" end="01:19:02.639" style="s2">think he&#39;s working on a project called</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.639" end="01:19:04.949" style="s2">world brain of which one when pieces is</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.639" end="01:19:06.719" style="s2">called mimics so they&#39;re looking at it</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.949" end="01:19:09.570" style="s2">from the point of view of how do we</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.719" end="01:19:11.550" style="s2">generate an information architecture a</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.570" end="01:19:14.969" style="s2">technical tool like Wikipedia is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.550" end="01:19:17.090" style="s2">technical tool that by its nature the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.969" end="01:19:19.619" style="s2">way that it&#39;s physically designed up</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.090" end="01:19:21.780" style="s2">regulates the generativity of anybody</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.619" end="01:19:22.769" style="s2">who uses it so that&#39;s one example by the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.780" end="01:19:24.179" style="s2">way it&#39;s very important the very</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.769" end="01:19:25.800" style="s2">important example that sounds like we</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.179" end="01:19:28.619" style="s2">said think that the media that we use</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.800" end="01:19:29.730" style="s2">sure our expressive capacity in certain</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.619" end="01:19:31.320" style="s2">ways and then don&#39;t further than other</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.730" end="01:19:34.499" style="s2">ways well one of the things we can use</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.320" end="01:19:36.449" style="s2">is design we can design or redesign the</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.499" end="01:19:38.489" style="s2">tools that we use to upregulate our</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.449" end="01:19:42.599" style="s2">generative capacity so in this case what</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.489" end="01:19:44.400" style="s2">happens is the this piece this approach</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.599" end="01:19:45.989" style="s2">has it has the advantage of scale in</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.400" end="01:19:47.969" style="s2">some sense everybody on the planet could</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.989" end="01:19:49.619" style="s2">use this tool and so everybody in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.969" end="01:19:52.590" style="s2">planet would then be participating in</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.619" end="01:19:55.550" style="s2">some level in a meta generative meta</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.590" end="01:19:58.590" style="s2">tribe so that&#39;s one more approach as</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.550" end="01:20:02.519" style="s2">another approach I actually participated</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.590" end="01:20:04.559" style="s2">in a I guess a project or a gathering I</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.519" end="01:20:08.610" style="s2">think that the overall project headline</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.559" end="01:20:10.530" style="s2">is called Jubilee and they were using a</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.610" end="01:20:14.610" style="s2">with you&#39;re calling a sacred technology</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.530" end="01:20:18.749" style="s2">from the indigenous peoples of North</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.610" end="01:20:19.800" style="s2">America called circle circle practice or</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.749" end="01:20:23.059" style="s2">circle talking it&#39;s not it&#39;s not guys</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.800" end="01:20:23.059" style="s2">since dr. circling it&#39;s more like a</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.269" end="01:20:27.869" style="s2">Kevin&#39;s in the language so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.519" end="01:20:30.440" style="s2">very specific term Anthony I know there</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.869" end="01:20:32.460" style="s2">is anyway a circle of people talking and</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.440" end="01:20:33.749" style="s2">particular characteristics exactly how</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.460" end="01:20:36.960" style="s2">it works in what you do when your prep</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.749" end="01:20:39.499" style="s2">is we are called called upon and they</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.960" end="01:20:41.849" style="s2">were bringing in the inquiry of</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.499" end="01:20:44.400" style="s2">endeavouring to actually do the work of</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.849" end="01:20:46.260" style="s2">healing the primordial wound of science</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:48.780" style="s2">which involves first the inquiry of what</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.260" end="01:20:50.059" style="s2">is that primordial world and we may be</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.780" end="01:20:51.589" style="s2">just getting to the bottom of it</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.059" end="01:20:53.539" style="s2">healing them and what they brought</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.589" end="01:20:56.300" style="s2">together was a quite diverse group of</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.539" end="01:20:57.379" style="s2">individuals which was me as well as</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.300" end="01:20:58.789" style="s2">individuals who are representing</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.379" end="01:21:01.519" style="s2">different indigenous groups and</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.789" end="01:21:03.319" style="s2">different cultures that were</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.519" end="01:21:04.669" style="s2">participating in this circle in Oakland</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.319" end="01:21:06.169" style="s2">and then there will be others in</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.669" end="01:21:08.239" style="s2">different locations using the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.169" end="01:21:11.449" style="s2">sacred technology and certain cross over</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.239" end="01:21:14.209" style="s2">participants and there was a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.449" end="01:21:16.729" style="s2">distinct awareness both in the circle</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.209" end="01:21:19.099" style="s2">and then after by on the part of this</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.729" end="01:21:21.530" style="s2">group of this of the sacred technology</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.099" end="01:21:24.139" style="s2">itself like the technology the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.530" end="01:21:28.189" style="s2">was saying ok you know we&#39;ve got like a</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.139" end="01:21:30.109" style="s2">you know Western scientists from just</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.189" end="01:21:32.510" style="s2">straight down the middle in this group</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.109" end="01:21:36.289" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve got you know an in person</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.510" end="01:21:39.109" style="s2">for an indigenous nation that they had a</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.289" end="01:21:42.649" style="s2">lot of epistemological and historical</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.109" end="01:21:43.609" style="s2">and emotional distance between them how</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.649" end="01:21:45.979" style="s2">can we actually have a generative</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.609" end="01:21:47.300" style="s2">conversation these are these are</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.979" end="01:21:49.429" style="s2">actually two very concrete tribes that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.300" end="01:21:50.989" style="s2">are quite distinct and oftentimes don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.429" end="01:21:52.339" style="s2">get along and can&#39;t enough times in fact</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.989" end="01:21:54.829" style="s2">it pissed OMA logically can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.339" end="01:21:57.379" style="s2">communicate and I remember actually a</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.829" end="01:22:00.589" style="s2">particular story where it was a just</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.379" end="01:22:01.909" style="s2">sort of spoken as obvious that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.589" end="01:22:04.429" style="s2">part of the same human family because we</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.909" end="01:22:05.719" style="s2">all started in Africa and the indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.429" end="01:22:06.889" style="s2">guys like I don&#39;t know about you but my</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.719" end="01:22:09.589" style="s2">people came out of a hole in the ground</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.889" end="01:22:11.149" style="s2">near the river he just tried to impose</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.589" end="01:22:12.679" style="s2">an epistemology on me about the nature</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.149" end="01:22:15.499" style="s2">of reality that I don&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.679" end="01:22:17.209" style="s2">that&#39;s not my mr. Hollin gman so like</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.499" end="01:22:19.249" style="s2">whoa okay so that&#39;s and she&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.209" end="01:22:21.260" style="s2">resolve that gradient with an effort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.249" end="01:22:23.359" style="s2">this particular sacred technology thank</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.260" end="01:22:25.129" style="s2">you for participating in this it was a</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.359" end="01:22:27.829" style="s2">lot a lot of that you know like guys in</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.129" end="01:22:29.889" style="s2">stocks were circling practice is efforts</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.829" end="01:22:33.169" style="s2">to figure out how to actually generate</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.889" end="01:22:34.189" style="s2">relationality dynamics that change the</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.169" end="01:22:35.599" style="s2">way that we&#39;re actually able to have</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.189" end="01:22:38.539" style="s2">kinds of conversations I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.599" end="01:22:40.729" style="s2">beginning a project with gai and John</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.539" end="01:22:41.869" style="s2">for baekje and Kris I don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.729" end="01:22:43.309" style="s2">how it&#39;s gonna play out but the four of</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.869" end="01:22:46.039" style="s2">us just started having a conversation of</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.309" end="01:22:47.359" style="s2">being more self aware like being more</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.039" end="01:22:51.109" style="s2">intentional about trying to do exactly</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.359" end="01:22:53.869" style="s2">that kind of thing at a meta level what</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.109" end="01:22:56.719" style="s2">I would say is that the there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.869" end="01:23:00.800" style="s2">set of basic characteristics that will</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.719" end="01:23:04.480" style="s2">give you the generativity of a of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.800" end="01:23:07.100" style="s2">tribe but of a gathering of human beings</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.480" end="01:23:08.450" style="s2">these are like the design constraints</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.100" end="01:23:11.030" style="s2">and they&#39;re actually constraints and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.450" end="01:23:12.410" style="s2">they have tensions so I mentioned one</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.030" end="01:23:14.480" style="s2">earlier like homogeneity versus</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.410" end="01:23:18.350" style="s2">heterogeneity or diversity versus</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.480" end="01:23:20.180" style="s2">sameness so a fully homogeneous group</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.350" end="01:23:21.530" style="s2">has a very low generativity essentially</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.180" end="01:23:22.880" style="s2">they collapse wasn&#39;t called a physical</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.530" end="01:23:24.380" style="s2">point you know if you and I believe</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.880" end="01:23:25.460" style="s2">exactly the same things there is no</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.380" end="01:23:29.630" style="s2">difference between us we are the same</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.460" end="01:23:30.860" style="s2">person and this that and then we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.630" end="01:23:31.820" style="s2">generative like our dialogue and I</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.860" end="01:23:33.820" style="s2">helpful it&#39;s just some of us will be</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.820" end="01:23:35.690" style="s2">dying with myself I&#39;m closer to myself</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.820" end="01:23:38.660" style="s2">to the degree to which you and I have</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.690" end="01:23:41.450" style="s2">diverse perspectives the possibility is</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.660" end="01:23:43.700" style="s2">larger and then the generativity is some</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.450" end="01:23:45.830" style="s2">something but of course as the diversity</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.700" end="01:23:47.720" style="s2">increases then you have the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.830" end="01:23:49.820" style="s2">actually communicating I&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.720" end="01:23:51.860" style="s2">space we have to traverse if you speak</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.820" end="01:23:53.510" style="s2">Klingon and I only speak through a</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.860" end="01:23:55.010" style="s2">language of light signals and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.510" end="01:23:56.570" style="s2">blind we&#39;re gonna have a really hard</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.010" end="01:23:58.550" style="s2">time communicating of a huge diversity</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.570" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">of perspective but the diversity is so</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.550" end="01:24:02.660" style="s2">large that the actualization of that</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.320" end="01:24:03.650" style="s2">possibility is essentially zero and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.660" end="01:24:05.380" style="s2">you&#39;re actually solving for two</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.650" end="01:24:07.730" style="s2">different constraints you need to have</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.380" end="01:24:10.010" style="s2">enough diversity of perspective the</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.730" end="01:24:11.720" style="s2">possibility space is large but you have</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.010" end="01:24:13.490" style="s2">to have enough sameness that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.720" end="01:24:15.290" style="s2">actualization of that possibility is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.490" end="01:24:17.180" style="s2">real and those are there&#39;s a two</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.290" end="01:24:19.400" style="s2">constraint you need to have and then in</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.180" end="01:24:21.020" style="s2">between those two now you have your</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.400" end="01:24:22.490" style="s2">psycho technologies or your sacred</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.020" end="01:24:24.230" style="s2">technology or associate technologies</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.490" end="01:24:26.870" style="s2">depending on what you&#39;d like to do which</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.230" end="01:24:29.630" style="s2">are precisely about enabling the</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.870" end="01:24:30.830" style="s2">shifting of that gradient and so a wide</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.630" end="01:24:32.360" style="s2">variety of different kinds of psycho</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.830" end="01:24:35.420" style="s2">technologies cannot be regulate the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.360" end="01:24:38.090" style="s2">capacity to process different things</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.420" end="01:24:39.410" style="s2">that get in the way of communication so</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.090" end="01:24:40.100" style="s2">if I want to go in the direction of</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.410" end="01:24:42.050" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.100" end="01:24:43.460" style="s2">Google Translate helps somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.050" end="01:24:44.630" style="s2">speaks French speaks somebody who speaks</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.460" end="01:24:45.800" style="s2">English to a greater or lesser extent</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.630" end="01:24:47.750" style="s2">they help a lot better than that have</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.800" end="01:24:51.860" style="s2">endured all right so let&#39;s say socio</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.750" end="01:24:53.840" style="s2">technology that allows now me who speaks</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.860" end="01:24:56.060" style="s2">English to have a much larger capacity</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.840" end="01:24:57.200" style="s2">to actualize the possibility of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.060" end="01:24:59.210" style="s2">conversation of somebody who&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.200" end="01:25:00.500" style="s2">fluent in French and the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.210" end="01:25:02.000" style="s2">between us might be quite large</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.500" end="01:25:04.180" style="s2">there&#39;s something about languages it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.000" end="01:25:07.940" style="s2">real and this is kind of a neat thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.180" end="01:25:10.480" style="s2">circling practice since duck stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.940" end="01:25:13.850" style="s2">really helps with people when you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.480" end="01:25:16.070" style="s2">drama between people where the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.850" end="01:25:17.390" style="s2">relationality is an issue just to sheer</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.070" end="01:25:19.310" style="s2">ability to be in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.390" end="01:25:20.510" style="s2">is an issue and it creates a container</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.310" end="01:25:21.920" style="s2">where we&#39;re actually exploring what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.510" end="01:25:24.740" style="s2">going on in our relationship is almost a</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.920" end="01:25:25.940" style="s2">primary inquiry and that dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.740" end="01:25:27.320" style="s2">increases the possibility of at least</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.940" end="01:25:28.730" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s happening and then maybe</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.320" end="01:25:29.870" style="s2">being able to address it in an</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.730" end="01:25:31.250" style="s2">increasingly mature and effective</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.870" end="01:25:32.150" style="s2">fashion and then we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.250" end="01:25:33.590" style="s2">potentially have generative</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.150" end="01:25:35.540" style="s2">conversations outside of that and it may</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.590" end="01:25:36.830" style="s2">be the only dinner to we we want end or</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.540" end="01:25:38.050" style="s2">need is relational because that may be</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.830" end="01:25:41.980" style="s2">the thing that we&#39;re trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.050" end="01:25:44.960" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of lots I mean the spaces</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.980" end="01:25:46.220" style="s2">absurdly enormous but broadly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.960" end="01:25:49.730" style="s2">I&#39;d say it&#39;s there&#39;s three primary</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.220" end="01:25:51.710" style="s2">characteristics one is sovereignty so</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.730" end="01:25:53.480" style="s2">this is your capacity as an individual</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.710" end="01:25:56.030" style="s2">to more and more and more be able to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.480" end="01:25:59.240" style="s2">in relationship with reality which</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.030" end="01:26:01.460" style="s2">includes other people the second is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.240" end="01:26:03.980" style="s2">set of psycho technologies that are</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.460" end="01:26:06.080" style="s2">associated with increasing the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.980" end="01:26:08.270" style="s2">to move from the possibility of a</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.080" end="01:26:10.940" style="s2">conversation into exact shoe allottee</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.270" end="01:26:11.900" style="s2">through the complexity whatever happens</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.940" end="01:26:15.080" style="s2">through the characteristics of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.900" end="01:26:17.090" style="s2">conversation and then the third is the</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.080" end="01:26:19.580" style="s2">actual conversations who&#39;s talking to</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.090" end="01:26:21.740" style="s2">who and what was the was the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.580" end="01:26:23.840" style="s2">thing that&#39;s bringing people into place</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.740" end="01:26:26.210" style="s2">what is the discernment that is allowing</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.840" end="01:26:27.800" style="s2">people to choose exactly where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.210" end="01:26:29.690" style="s2">going to put their time and attention in</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.800" end="01:26:32.570" style="s2">which combination of possible</p>
