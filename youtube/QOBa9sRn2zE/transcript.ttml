<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:08.130" style="s2">thing and that thing is the</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.950" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">the mainstream media has pretended not</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">been a monopoly effectively on narrative</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">held by the collection of major</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:48.560" style="s2">institutional voices and to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:52.670" style="s2">you have something like Fox News versus</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.560" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">NPR and those are going to be different</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.670" end="00:01:58.770" style="s2">flavors but to a remarkable extent even</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">those two voices are remarkably agreed</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">on things that I don&#39;t think the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:09.170" style="s2">us should be agreed on and so the true</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">spectrum of thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.170" end="00:02:14.090" style="s2">is far broader than people have been led</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.860" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">to believe and I think that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.090" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">IDW comes in that we are it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">we&#39;re just outside of the Overton Window</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.650" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">many of the points we&#39;re making really</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.630" end="00:02:33.739" style="s2">simply commonplace observations did you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.390" end="00:02:38.840" style="s2">have any doubts about that New York</p>

<p begin="00:02:38.840" end="00:02:47.870" style="s2">infinite number of doubts about the New</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.870" end="00:02:54.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a conflict part of me wants to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.390" end="00:02:56.780" style="s2">work quietly and part of me realizes</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.049" end="00:03:01.160" style="s2">that we have to work in some public</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.780" end="00:03:03.410" style="s2">facing capacity and I personally have</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.160" end="00:03:08.360" style="s2">found it much more comfortable to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.410" end="00:03:11.569" style="s2">private life to not have everything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.360" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking broadcast to a large</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.569" end="00:03:16.340" style="s2">audience but I think we&#39;ve run out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:20.090" style="s2">time and so I think some of us are</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.340" end="00:03:22.880" style="s2">somewhat reluctantly choosing to make a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.090" end="00:03:24.380" style="s2">different call now I think that with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.880" end="00:03:28.790" style="s2">current administration and the White</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.380" end="00:03:30.200" style="s2">House you&#39;re seeing a real discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.790" end="00:03:32.870" style="s2">with the past and it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.200" end="00:03:34.790" style="s2">discontinuity that I was hoping for we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.870" end="00:03:36.079" style="s2">had to break with the past and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.790" end="00:03:38.470" style="s2">that the way in which we are now</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.079" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">breaking with the past is so destructive</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.470" end="00:03:42.230" style="s2">nobody knows what to believe nobody</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:44.019" style="s2">quite knows what&#39;s true nobody knows</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.230" end="00:03:47.239" style="s2">where to turn</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.019" end="00:03:48.890" style="s2">this is not a tenable situation and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.239" end="00:03:52.100" style="s2">either we&#39;re going to descend into some</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.890" end="00:03:53.930" style="s2">kind of permanent chaos or there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.100" end="00:03:55.609" style="s2">going to be have to be something that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.930" end="00:03:58.850" style="s2">reboot from and that thing cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.609" end="00:04:00.829" style="s2">simply left or simply right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.850" end="00:04:04.310" style="s2">one of the reasons the IDW is hopeful to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:07.250" style="s2">me is that it&#39;s a collection of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.310" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">who agree really on what a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.250" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">sounds like and and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:14.180" style="s2">because ultimately you have to self</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:15.980" style="s2">referee it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.180" end="00:04:18.950" style="s2">different species of person that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.980" end="00:04:22.070" style="s2">to referee conversations you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.950" end="00:04:23.150" style="s2">whether one point carried the day by</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.070" end="00:04:25.340" style="s2">listening to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.150" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">versus NPR because those two sets of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.340" end="00:04:29.210" style="s2">referees might disagree as to who made</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:30.830" style="s2">the better point you need a group of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.210" end="00:04:31.970" style="s2">people who are willing to say hey you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.830" end="00:04:34.520" style="s2">know you made a better point and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.970" end="00:04:36.220" style="s2">changed my mind and I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.520" end="00:04:40.490" style="s2">something that I didn&#39;t think about and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.220" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">that kind of integrity in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.490" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2">is what characterizes a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">internal IDW discussion to me it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:50.330" style="s2">people agree not on their positions they</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:52.280" style="s2">may not even agree as to what the facts</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.330" end="00:04:55.340" style="s2">are but they usually agree as to what</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.280" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">constitutes a conversation I&#39;d say I</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.340" end="00:04:59.560" style="s2">mean as an outside observer being also</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:01.850" style="s2">sort of caught up in the excitement</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.560" end="00:05:03.020" style="s2">what&#39;s amazing is that kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.850" end="00:05:05.900" style="s2">seeing the conversation becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.020" end="00:05:08.120" style="s2">self-aware on the Rubin report this sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.900" end="00:05:09.110" style="s2">of sense of Dave Rubin in particular is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.120" end="00:05:11.660" style="s2">kind of like something&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.110" end="00:05:14.660" style="s2">something&#39;s happening and you call it a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.660" end="00:05:16.310" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s also it seems it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.660" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">also modeling what thinking looks like</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.310" end="00:05:21.410" style="s2">what genuine thinking looks like where</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:24.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of your mind could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.410" end="00:05:26.330" style="s2">changed by this conversation it and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.050" end="00:05:28.550" style="s2">I guess is is showing how thirsty maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.330" end="00:05:30.980" style="s2">we are for that sort of sense of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.550" end="00:05:34.190" style="s2">inquiry and genuine thinking I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.980" end="00:05:36.590" style="s2">Dave in particular is very moved by</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.190" end="00:05:38.990" style="s2">being out on the road both going and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.590" end="00:05:41.000" style="s2">touring his own comedy club appearances</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.990" end="00:05:44.480" style="s2">and also opening for Jordan Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.000" end="00:05:48.740" style="s2">he&#39;s insisted that I follow him and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.480" end="00:05:50.360" style="s2">couple of occasions onto the stage and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.740" end="00:05:53.540" style="s2">now understand what he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.360" end="00:05:55.370" style="s2">he people are coming up after these gigs</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.540" end="00:05:57.980" style="s2">and saying I&#39;m afraid to express what</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.370" end="00:05:59.270" style="s2">you expressed thank you for doing it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.980" end="00:06:01.460" style="s2">almost at the point where I feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.270" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">comfortable but I lost a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.460" end="00:06:04.820" style="s2">friends and some relatives who won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:06.830" style="s2">talk to me anymore like well what did</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.820" end="00:06:09.980" style="s2">you say the person might have said</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.830" end="00:06:11.510" style="s2">something as innocuous as I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.980" end="00:06:14.510" style="s2">convinced that there aren&#39;t biological</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.770" end="00:06:27.380" style="s2">people are very worried about what the</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.190" end="00:07:03.540" style="s2">and I want may want fewer immigrants</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.200" end="00:07:05.400" style="s2">rather than more immigrants that person</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.540" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">is now held up as if they&#39;ve said</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">so we&#39;ve gotten to a completely crazy</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.470" end="00:07:32.550" style="s2">in a funhouse mirror and they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.600" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">themselves come back so distorted and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:37.890" style="s2">ugly that they&#39;re asking like what just</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.880" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">happened I fell asleep for a few years</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.890" end="00:07:41.880" style="s2">and I wake up Rick Van Rip Van Winkle</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:44.250" style="s2">style and I&#39;m in a world in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.880" end="00:07:48.270" style="s2">suddenly I&#39;m the bad guy for simply</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.250" end="00:07:53.120" style="s2">holding very commonplace ideas now those</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.270" end="00:07:55.860" style="s2">people are so excited to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.120" end="00:08:01.229" style="s2">conversations taking place with decency</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.860" end="00:08:03.990" style="s2">with with you know comity and equanimity</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.229" end="00:08:06.150" style="s2">so that these positions are not held in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.990" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">an ugly fashion but they&#39;re simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.150" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">seeing a conversation take place that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.840" style="s2">they remember or that they dreamed was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">possible and they&#39;re not seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.840" end="00:08:17.250" style="s2">reflected anywhere else I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:20.790" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s really exciting is is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.250" end="00:08:23.340" style="s2">the IDW conversation is the public front</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.790" end="00:08:26.310" style="s2">of a national conversation that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.340" end="00:08:29.900" style="s2">bizarrely taking place in hushed</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.310" end="00:08:33.510" style="s2">whispers with people metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.900" end="00:08:36.450" style="s2">living in closets not ready to jump out</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.510" end="00:08:38.250" style="s2">and declare hey I have some beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.450" end="00:08:40.200" style="s2">you are going to find shocking but to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.250" end="00:08:41.669" style="s2">are absolutely garden-variety believes</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.200" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">the counter-argument to that would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.669" end="00:08:43.840" style="s2">that actually the writer in power at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:46.090" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.840" end="00:08:47.890" style="s2">you look at what Trump is doing with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.090" end="00:08:48.520" style="s2">the children in cages and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.890" end="00:08:51.700" style="s2">sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.520" end="00:08:53.050" style="s2">so there is a political movement where a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.700" end="00:08:56.680" style="s2">lot of these things are actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.050" end="00:09:00.270" style="s2">happening well I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.680" end="00:09:03.370" style="s2">really believe that what I believe is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.270" end="00:09:05.830" style="s2">that you&#39;ve starved people for any</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.370" end="00:09:09.240" style="s2">ability to make a very simple point</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.830" end="00:09:12.910" style="s2">all right so for example imagine that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.240" end="00:09:15.100" style="s2">analogize the country to a house and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.910" end="00:09:19.510" style="s2">key question was should we allow people</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.100" end="00:09:21.370" style="s2">to come for dinner like a visitor so</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.510" end="00:09:24.100" style="s2">that would be like a tourist visa or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.370" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">temporary worker so now we have an issue</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.100" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">where every person who comes for dinner</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:31.270" style="s2">somebody in the family wants to give</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">them a key and to formally adopt them</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.270" end="00:09:35.590" style="s2">into the family well some members of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">family are saying where were we whoa</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.590" end="00:09:37.870" style="s2">slow down</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:39.820" style="s2">we know we&#39;re just having visitors over</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.870" end="00:09:41.590" style="s2">for dinner and maybe we could adopt a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.820" end="00:09:43.950" style="s2">child but this is not something that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.590" end="00:09:46.870" style="s2">want to do in an uncontrolled fashion</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.950" end="00:09:49.050" style="s2">suddenly that being told by the couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.870" end="00:09:51.580" style="s2">members of the family who wants sky-high</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.050" end="00:09:53.620" style="s2">adoption inside of the family that these</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.580" end="00:09:56.260" style="s2">are bad people and that they&#39;re bigoted</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.620" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">and etc etcetera well you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.260" end="00:10:01.990" style="s2">an absolutely embittered angry group of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.390" style="s2">people who are who are saying look this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.990" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">is a home and we&#39;re generous people but</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.390" end="00:10:09.700" style="s2">adoption I mean you you&#39;re gonna dilute</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:11.770" style="s2">all of us in some fashion well this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.700" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">mirror of the national conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.770" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">what you&#39;re hearing is not the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.180" end="00:10:23.970" style="s2">astronomers n ting a restriction</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.860" end="00:10:27.160" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the only people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.970" end="00:10:29.020" style="s2">so incensed I guess in such a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.160" end="00:10:32.020" style="s2">desensitized State that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.020" end="00:10:35.850" style="s2">make terrible arguments for holding up</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.020" end="00:10:38.260" style="s2">borders or enforcing visas and not</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.850" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">pushing everybody towards it on a path</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.260" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">toward citizenship so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:45.730" style="s2">what&#39;s going on is is that you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:47.230" style="s2">a very bad version of restriction ISM in</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.730" end="00:10:49.570" style="s2">the White House because that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.230" end="00:10:51.460" style="s2">that&#39;s been offered by the system but</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.570" end="00:10:53.110" style="s2">what is the IDW it&#39;s going to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.460" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">completely different alternative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.110" end="00:10:56.950" style="s2">going to say look other cultures are</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:58.780" style="s2">super exciting we&#39;re deaf</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.950" end="00:11:00.670" style="s2">going to have some immigration and some</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.780" end="00:11:02.920" style="s2">of it&#39;s good for our country some of its</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.670" end="00:11:04.570" style="s2">good for the UK but what is that level</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.920" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">maybe that level should go up maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.570" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">level should go down it has zero to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.670" end="00:11:10.840" style="s2">with xenophobia it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:13.000" style="s2">legitimate interests of a country people</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.840" end="00:11:14.500" style="s2">not wanting to be diluted people wanting</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:16.060" style="s2">to have something of their own culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.500" end="00:11:18.220" style="s2">that they can bring to the international</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.060" end="00:11:19.990" style="s2">potluck and not being told that their</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.220" end="00:11:22.270" style="s2">substrate culture is somehow deficient</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.990" end="00:11:24.220" style="s2">and that every culture that&#39;s coming in</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.270" end="00:11:27.010" style="s2">should be held up and celebrated I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.220" end="00:11:29.620" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty common sense I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.010" end="00:11:31.480" style="s2">understand in any way shape or form why</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.620" end="00:11:33.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve gotten to a place where the only</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.480" end="00:11:36.280" style="s2">people who can sort of talk in public</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.640" end="00:11:38.830" style="s2">are either very far</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.280" end="00:11:41.860" style="s2">you know jingoistic far far gone</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.830" end="00:11:44.710" style="s2">jingoistic restriction estai negro of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.860" end="00:11:47.250" style="s2">people in the IDW who are going to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.710" end="00:11:49.750" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.250" end="00:11:52.420" style="s2">you&#39;ve described this as a civil war</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.750" end="00:11:53.530" style="s2">within the left could you could you</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.420" end="00:12:01.690" style="s2">explain what you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.530" end="00:12:05.770" style="s2">um sure I mean I think that the the left</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.690" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">that I relate to is the left that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.770" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">realizes that the past cannot supply the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:14.050" style="s2">answers and that we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.110" end="00:12:17.170" style="s2">progress because we can&#39;t stay here it</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.050" end="00:12:19.630" style="s2">is not the left that believes we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.170" end="00:12:21.910" style="s2">wish ourselves into a beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.630" end="00:12:23.560" style="s2">by pretending that the reap that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.910" end="00:12:26.770" style="s2">world is different than it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.560" end="00:12:29.230" style="s2">so I think that the key thing that it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.770" end="00:12:31.750" style="s2">an agreement between these two groups is</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.230" end="00:12:33.910" style="s2">that we have to get to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.750" end="00:12:36.850" style="s2">better place and that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.910" end="00:12:39.310" style="s2">progressive in progressivism where we</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.850" end="00:12:40.960" style="s2">are deeply divided and you know again</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.310" end="00:12:44.310" style="s2">these are the divisions that are is much</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:47.890" style="s2">worse than between left and right</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.310" end="00:12:51.070" style="s2">how these absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.890" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">imbecilic figures believe that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.070" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">just wish yourself into paradise that</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:13:00.430" style="s2">that you can just say you know free good</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.180" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">things for everybody well it just</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.430" end="00:13:04.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make a whit of sense or you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:08.110" style="s2">you&#39;re going to wish human beings to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.780" end="00:13:09.030" style="s2">both simultaneously non-diverse so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.110" end="00:13:11.580" style="s2">you can argue that</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.580" end="00:13:17.400" style="s2">group in any occupation is evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.060" end="00:13:18.630" style="s2">oppression and then you&#39;re going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.400" end="00:13:20.040" style="s2">around and argue that people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.630" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">actually incredibly different because</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:28.410" style="s2">diversity I mean this is not even self</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.080" end="00:13:30.420" style="s2">consistent this is this would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.410" end="00:13:32.640" style="s2">offensive to an intelligent</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.230" end="00:15:44.140" style="s2">voter base labour has economic issues so</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.010" end="00:15:46.810" style="s2">this is the great search for something</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.140" end="00:15:48.670" style="s2">cheaper than labour and identity turns</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.810" end="00:15:51.090" style="s2">out to be much cheaper than labour if</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.410" end="00:16:02.890" style="s2">you&#39;re going to celebrate the fact you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.170" end="00:16:06.550" style="s2">know that they came from Laos that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.890" end="00:16:08.890" style="s2">bad deal nothing against the Laotians</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.550" end="00:16:11.830" style="s2">but for God&#39;s sake stand up for yourself</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.340" end="00:16:32.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly why I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.320" end="00:16:36.010" style="s2">happening I think it&#39;s because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.140" end="00:16:37.900" style="s2">traditional Democratic voter base was</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.010" end="00:16:39.850" style="s2">too expensive they wanted real change</p>

<p begin="00:16:45.670" end="00:16:49.810" style="s2">there isn&#39;t there anything cheaper than</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.260" end="00:16:51.880" style="s2">labour and I think they found something</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.810" end="00:16:55.030" style="s2">do you see the IDW is primarily a</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.880" end="00:16:59.470" style="s2">political project no I don&#39;t I see it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.030" end="00:17:04.120" style="s2">primarily as a precursor to anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.470" end="00:17:05.950" style="s2">decent it&#39;s what has to succeed for us</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.120" end="00:17:07.090" style="s2">to have a political conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.950" end="00:17:10.870" style="s2">think we&#39;re having a political</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.090" end="00:17:12.910" style="s2">conversation either internationally or</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.870" end="00:17:14.770" style="s2">nationally I think we have people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.910" end="00:17:16.540" style="s2">are talking about nonsense positions we</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.770" end="00:17:18.040" style="s2">just went back to the immigration</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.540" end="00:17:20.380" style="s2">position there are only two positions</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.040" end="00:17:22.030" style="s2">I&#39;m convinced aren&#39;t political one is</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.060" end="00:17:30.660" style="s2">and yet you very often encounter people</p>

<p begin="00:17:30.660" end="00:17:35.000" style="s2">these are the actual positions so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.790" end="00:17:36.590" style="s2">don&#39;t think that we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.000" end="00:17:38.570" style="s2">political conversation I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.590" end="00:17:40.280" style="s2">what&#39;s been going on is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.570" end="00:17:43.340" style="s2">mainstream media has been playing</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.280" end="00:17:44.720" style="s2">keep-away ball right so this game where</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.340" end="00:17:46.190" style="s2">you&#39;re throwing the ball over somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:47.420" style="s2">who&#39;s trying to catch it now the public</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.190" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">had been trying to get in on this</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.420" end="00:17:52.460" style="s2">conversation but what keeps happening is</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:54.380" style="s2">is that our fake left and our fake right</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.460" end="00:17:56.930" style="s2">are engaged in a completely fake</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.380" end="00:17:59.300" style="s2">conversation about fake items including</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.930" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">fake news which they themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.300" end="00:18:03.380" style="s2">pushing out and then claiming to fight</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:06.710" style="s2">fake news so the whole thing is so</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.380" end="00:18:08.990" style="s2">saturated in falsehood that people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.710" end="00:18:10.940" style="s2">waking up to the idea ohm I forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.990" end="00:18:12.560" style="s2">what it sound sounded like for people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.940" end="00:18:15.680" style="s2">actually have a discussion about a topic</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.560" end="00:18:18.530" style="s2">and how much time it takes you know in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.680" end="00:18:20.840" style="s2">general it can&#39;t be done with four or</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.530" end="00:18:22.280" style="s2">five voices on a panel in 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.840" end="00:18:24.470" style="s2">with a few commercial interruptions</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.280" end="00:18:26.150" style="s2">there&#39;s just almost nothing can be</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.150" end="00:18:29.390" style="s2">worse is that the very people who would</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.740" end="00:18:30.740" style="s2">be best able to discuss it are never</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.390" end="00:18:33.260" style="s2">going to be invited on to those programs</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.740" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">and how would you describe your</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.360" end="00:18:42.740" style="s2">mean I think we had two tariffs that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.890" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">had to three terrible candidates and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.740" end="00:18:48.740" style="s2">thought Bernie was absolutely the least</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:50.450" style="s2">bad of the three but none of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.740" end="00:18:54.350" style="s2">people were fit for the White House I</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.450" end="00:18:59.900" style="s2">mean Donald Trump is by far too erratic</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.350" end="00:19:02.990" style="s2">and too destructive to the to the fabric</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.290" end="00:19:18.490" style="s2">thought that he was the most decent of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.060" end="00:19:20.900" style="s2">the three and that we could easily</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.710" end="00:19:59.090" style="s2">is that you realize things have got to a</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.700" end="00:27:02.940" style="s2">probably on the Rubin report that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.490" end="00:27:05.940" style="s2">going on is that when you ask any large</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.940" end="00:27:07.769" style="s2">collection of people to salute a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.940" end="00:27:11.340" style="s2">nonsensical flag and pledge allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.769" end="00:27:14.039" style="s2">to it and more or less everyone makes</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.340" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">the calculation I guess if this is going</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.039" end="00:27:18.690" style="s2">to get me through my day I&#39;ll salute any</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">flag and you&#39;ve got the one gal or one</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.690" end="00:27:23.070" style="s2">guy who doesn&#39;t want to well my</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:25.559" style="s2">observation is that that person is</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.070" end="00:27:28.529" style="s2">usually sitting on an entire mountain of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.559" end="00:27:30.539" style="s2">interesting thoughts that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.529" end="00:27:33.809" style="s2">have the freedom to simply make a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.539" end="00:27:36.419" style="s2">convenience readjustment and so from</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.809" end="00:27:39.779" style="s2">that perspective yeah in general if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.419" end="00:27:41.820" style="s2">ask a thousand people to salute a flag</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.779" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">that makes no sense and tell them that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.820" end="00:27:45.330" style="s2">they&#39;ll be incentivize you&#39;ll get a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">thousand-dollar check at the end or you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.330" end="00:27:50.700" style="s2">know you won&#39;t lose your job and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.370" end="00:27:52.139" style="s2">somebody stands up and says no way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.700" end="00:27:54.629" style="s2">getting out of here do what you want</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.139" end="00:27:56.669" style="s2">that person is usually much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.629" end="00:27:59.009" style="s2">interesting than just being a contrarian</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.669" end="00:28:01.610" style="s2">that person is usually saying no because</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.009" end="00:28:05.070" style="s2">they&#39;ve got an entire worldview that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.610" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">built by hand and and bespoke</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.070" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why this method of finding</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:12.750" style="s2">people has been relatively fruitful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.429" style="s2">people who don&#39;t back down usually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.750" end="00:28:17.580" style="s2">back down for a reason because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.429" end="00:28:19.320" style="s2">every reason just to go along and what</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.580" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">is what is the nature of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.320" end="00:28:24.840" style="s2">ideology that&#39;s the thing that unites</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:26.429" style="s2">the thing that unites I guess the IDW at</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.840" end="00:28:28.129" style="s2">the moment is a resistance to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.429" end="00:28:30.509" style="s2">type of thinking or a certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.129" end="00:28:32.789" style="s2">ideological thinking especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.509" end="00:28:36.039" style="s2">media how would you define that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.789" end="00:28:38.169" style="s2">thinking well it means very simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.039" end="00:28:39.940" style="s2">here are two characteristics that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.169" end="00:28:42.909" style="s2">think you&#39;d find in almost any member of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.940" end="00:28:47.379" style="s2">the IBEW almost every member of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.909" end="00:28:52.239" style="s2">that I can think of is going to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.379" end="00:28:54.879" style="s2">very positive responses to things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.239" end="00:28:57.369" style="s2">come out of Muslim culture and almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.879" end="00:28:59.909" style="s2">every member of the IDW is going to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.369" end="00:29:02.950" style="s2">a sense that there is a link between</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.909" end="00:29:04.389" style="s2">Islam and terror that is active at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.950" end="00:29:06.279" style="s2">moment that is not active at the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.389" end="00:29:09.749" style="s2">level for any other group terror against</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.279" end="00:29:11.889" style="s2">civilians okay well these are two simple</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.749" end="00:29:14.679" style="s2">principles which is you&#39;ve got a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.889" end="00:29:15.999" style="s2">large religion most people in that</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.009" end="00:29:40.059" style="s2">who are flummoxed why is it that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.960" end="00:29:43.509" style="s2">observe that somebody is saying allahu</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.059" end="00:29:45.099" style="s2">akbar after a mass killing the news</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.009" end="00:30:10.629" style="s2">that people in the IDW I think are</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.019" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">better at striking which is like we</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.629" end="00:30:14.289" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be closed borders we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.220" end="00:30:38.169" style="s2">these idiocy x&#39; for years and the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:41.499" style="s2">in the IDW in general hold relatively</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.169" end="00:30:45.429" style="s2">moderate perspectives and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.499" end="00:30:47.379" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s bizarre that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.429" end="00:30:48.940" style="s2">distinguishes us that we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.379" end="00:30:52.419" style="s2">hold moderate perspective</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.499" end="00:31:13.629" style="s2">in a dialectic and it is strange that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:16.269" style="s2">there is no training for holding those</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.629" end="00:31:18.779" style="s2">positions in public when the awesome</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.269" end="00:31:21.309" style="s2">power of the media is to miss portray</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.220" end="00:31:40.179" style="s2">think it&#39;s a bigger movement than just</p>

<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:49.629" style="s2">the collection of people who&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.340" end="00:31:51.489" style="s2">you know add to the conversation who</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.629" end="00:31:55.149" style="s2">might not be part of the core group and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.489" end="00:31:58.149" style="s2">I think what I see there is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.149" end="00:32:01.059" style="s2">enough to try to struggle outside of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.369" end="00:32:47.369" style="s2">speaking doesn&#39;t take the easy outs it</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.710" end="00:32:51.309" style="s2">would prefer to struggle between two</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.369" end="00:32:53.700" style="s2">competing ideas then simply sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.309" end="00:32:56.349" style="s2">one or the other because it&#39;s clean you</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.700" end="00:32:59.849" style="s2">in the the Rubin report I think with</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.349" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">your brother Brett you talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.849" end="00:33:03.999" style="s2">we pretty much had a blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:06.419" style="s2">we were starting from a blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.999" end="00:33:09.909" style="s2">because all of the prefab answers</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.419" end="00:33:12.279" style="s2">libertarianism socialism even capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.909" end="00:33:14.499" style="s2">don&#39;t work or play themselves out for</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.279" end="00:33:16.870" style="s2">game theoretic reasons could you explain</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.499" end="00:33:18.460" style="s2">what that means and in if so what what</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.870" end="00:33:21.580" style="s2">does that conversation start looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.460" end="00:33:24.249" style="s2">like well think about any of the major</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.580" end="00:33:26.649" style="s2">schools of thought that have failed to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.249" end="00:33:30.009" style="s2">carry the day it could be Austrian</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.030" end="00:35:05.349" style="s2">there was a really sort of deceptively</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.630" end="00:35:14.799" style="s2">difficult to survive market forces is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.460" end="00:35:15.400" style="s2">the pursuit of truth the truth was</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.400" end="00:35:19.150" style="s2">market forces and that seems to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:20.440" style="s2">explain a lot of the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.150" end="00:35:22.210" style="s2">journalism as a lot of the crisis for</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.440" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">the educational institutions can you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.210" end="00:35:28.210" style="s2">explain a little bit more about why you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:30.549" style="s2">think that is well this goes back to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.210" end="00:35:34.260" style="s2">point I made that the clearing price of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.549" end="00:35:38.200" style="s2">truth is far higher than the newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.260" end="00:35:40.119" style="s2">reader was willing to pay so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.200" end="00:35:43.270" style="s2">that if you actually had real truth</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.119" end="00:35:45.220" style="s2">would be very valuable to you and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.270" end="00:35:47.410" style="s2">circumstances where you could act upon</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.220" end="00:35:50.740" style="s2">it and on the other hand a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.410" end="00:35:53.020" style="s2">other truth is not very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.740" end="00:35:56.140" style="s2">so occasionally you find truths that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.020" end="00:35:58.809" style="s2">that can&#39;t command important price</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.140" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">because they&#39;re just too dull they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.809" end="00:36:04.599" style="s2">not important so I do believe that in</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:09.160" style="s2">part you should look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.599" end="00:36:12.369" style="s2">journalism and realize that the business</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.160" end="00:36:17.559" style="s2">model doesn&#39;t quite make sense but that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.369" end="00:36:19.510" style="s2">there might be ways in which we would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.559" end="00:36:22.150" style="s2">better served for example independent</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.510" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">investigative journalists might be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.150" end="00:36:28.740" style="s2">better force for finding out</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:31.619" style="s2">institutional malfeasance than corporate</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.740" end="00:36:34.329" style="s2">investigative journalists who might be</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.619" end="00:36:37.180" style="s2">captured by virtue of the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.329" end="00:36:42.549" style="s2">have a mixed subscriber and advertiser</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.180" end="00:36:45.369" style="s2">model I do think that sometimes you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.549" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">to treat truth as a public good and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.369" end="00:36:51.549" style="s2">may have to decide that you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:54.130" style="s2">pay for it not at the level that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.549" end="00:36:55.630" style="s2">market will bear that amount of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.130" end="00:36:57.910" style="s2">price at the market will bear but at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.630" end="00:37:00.039" style="s2">higher price because it&#39;s in the long</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.039" end="00:37:04.839" style="s2">survival I think that&#39;s very true in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.049" end="00:37:06.520" style="s2">sciences it is important to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.839" end="00:37:09.039" style="s2">scientists produce a public good which</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.520" end="00:37:11.380" style="s2">is both inexhaustible in excludable and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.039" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">often not patentable by virtue of</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.980" end="00:37:24.600" style="s2">should be trying to figure out as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.690" end="00:37:27.300" style="s2">society how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.600" end="00:37:30.060" style="s2">those people from the market the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.300" end="00:37:32.970" style="s2">is is that the people who want that not</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.060" end="00:37:35.460" style="s2">done are very powerful because they are</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.460" end="00:37:41.250" style="s2">interests so it&#39;s an uphill battle it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.360" end="00:37:44.370" style="s2">seems that the the phenomena of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.250" end="00:37:45.780" style="s2">is is part of this great intellectual</p>

<p begin="00:37:49.830" end="00:37:55.530" style="s2">people are clearly hungry for a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.210" end="00:37:57.360" style="s2">intellectual stimulation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.530" end="00:38:01.970" style="s2">actually agree with this this is an idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.360" end="00:38:05.010" style="s2">that I think Jordan has slightly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.970" end="00:38:09.710" style="s2">so for a while I&#39;ve been making the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.010" end="00:38:09.710" style="s2">point that there was a change between</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.450" end="00:38:18.660" style="s2">writing for television was sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.860" end="00:38:20.580" style="s2">lowest form of of an art and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.660" end="00:38:24.750" style="s2">writing for movies allowed for real</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.580" end="00:38:27.840" style="s2">character development but that the multi</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.750" end="00:38:30.750" style="s2">season multi episode shows with very</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.840" end="00:38:32.490" style="s2">long storylines actually has the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.750" end="00:38:34.710" style="s2">greatest character development and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.490" end="00:38:38.850" style="s2">the the greatest writers are now writing</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.710" end="00:38:41.940" style="s2">for TV the important thing to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.850" end="00:38:45.830" style="s2">is is that it&#39;s not just the advent of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.940" end="00:38:49.140" style="s2">long-form podcasting what it is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.830" end="00:38:52.290" style="s2">having the courage to say something</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.290" end="00:38:57.620" style="s2">podcasts that aren&#39;t attracting almost</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.210" end="00:39:01.410" style="s2">anybody and the only reason that the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.620" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">is behaving in a different fashion is</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.410" end="00:39:08.820" style="s2">that it&#39;s marrying the content that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:11.820" style="s2">brave people are starved for with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.820" end="00:39:13.860" style="s2">change in technology and so in general</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.820" end="00:39:17.340" style="s2">most things don&#39;t work in a three-hour</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.860" end="00:39:18.630" style="s2">format what works in a three-hour format</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.340" end="00:39:21.840" style="s2">is when you&#39;re living through what I&#39;m</p>
