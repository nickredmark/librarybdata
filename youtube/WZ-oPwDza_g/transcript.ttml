<p begin="00:00:39.559" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">I was saying before we went live that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.780" end="00:00:49.370" style="s2">like last week was a good learning</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:51.239" style="s2">experience like Jasper brought a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.370" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">insight he&#39;s a very intelligent person</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t our board meeting right</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">like it wasn&#39;t moving our project</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">forward because we didn&#39;t have an agenda</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">lined out for a guest to come be part of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">and yeah just I have it on her agenda</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">for this week to discuss like if we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">future guests what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">to empower both them and us to move</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">forward or maybe I&#39;m wrong and yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">was last week was perfect it was moving</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">us forward I don&#39;t know how did you feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">about it I am struggling to remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:26.970" style="s2">last week actually I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t really move</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.970" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">forward so but I&#39;m trying to remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">why that was so because we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">his ideas mostly or I think I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">got in a bit debate about how to move</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">forward in a certain way sort of right</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">we were instructed not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">Microsoft garetty&#39;s I think what we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">looking to talk about and then instead</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">it was more explaining together tech and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">in his opinion our lack of direction</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">which is our direction it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:02.040" style="s2">exploring new ways to every time to move</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">forward in like what is working and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.040" end="00:02:06.149" style="s2">what&#39;s not working and so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">wanted to talk about micro solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.149" end="00:02:12.120" style="s2">and I wanted to talk about solutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">cooperative and how we turn this time</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:15.690" style="s2">spot this hour we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">together into how do we create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.690" end="00:02:19.560" style="s2">whether that&#39;s for together tech itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:21.330" style="s2">or for the worlds called fix our world</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.560" end="00:02:26.360" style="s2">Friday&#39;s like how does this hour</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.330" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">actually move together tech forward and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.360" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">create solutions using us and I go my</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">crystal linearity is a great way like</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:35.640" style="s2">that is kind of they were very</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:39.540" style="s2">intertwined so thinking that through I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.640" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">think one of the challenges was that his</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.540" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">a guest had more questions that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t already have answered before so</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">if the board meeting is a constructive</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:51.480" style="s2">meeting then we do need to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:54.210" style="s2">that everyone has had an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.480" end="00:02:55.740" style="s2">get those out so maybe having you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.210" end="00:02:57.210" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be like a perspective board</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.740" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">meeting or someone would be more like it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.210" end="00:03:00.930" style="s2">let&#39;s give them a time to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">talk and answer ask and ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.930" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">maybe outside the board meeting make</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">sure that we&#39;re all kind of aligned</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:12.240" style="s2">before we kind of move forward in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">board meeting yeah but that&#39;s just a but</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.240" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">I&#39;m just throwing that out there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">know if that work yeah no I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:19.709" style="s2">was part is like our agendas with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:20.790" style="s2">two of us is fine like we&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.709" end="00:03:22.230" style="s2">throw it together five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.790" end="00:03:23.580" style="s2">beforehand what we want to talk about I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.230" end="00:03:26.070" style="s2">think it works for the two of us when a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.580" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">third person comes in to that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.070" end="00:03:30.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of figuring it so right</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">is as more people we have to home as</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.390" end="00:03:36.209" style="s2">where people are added permanently and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:37.650" style="s2">just on a in a no basis to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.209" end="00:03:40.739" style="s2">that piece of it as different</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.650" end="00:03:42.330" style="s2">personality these people don&#39;t have we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.739" end="00:03:43.380" style="s2">don&#39;t have the blurb of like here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.330" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">we&#39;re doing looks like it&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.380" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">evolving and that is is in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:51.270" style="s2">kind of the project is that when things</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">don&#39;t work we fix them and figure them</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.270" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">out and try new things and most of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:57.930" style="s2">we&#39;re creating is chicken and egg like</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:03:58.980" style="s2">if what we were creating existed we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.930" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need to create it we could use</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.980" end="00:04:03.690" style="s2">it to create everything else but which</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:05.700" style="s2">piece do we play first and how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.690" end="00:04:08.280" style="s2">that within our capacity our time our</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.700" end="00:04:10.410" style="s2">money the people involved you know about</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.280" end="00:04:13.709" style="s2">that piece of it and working through</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.410" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">that every week but I don&#39;t like I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.709" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something we can do during this</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:22.470" style="s2">hour that is kind of putting it on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:25.200" style="s2">back burner well still moving it forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.470" end="00:04:26.370" style="s2">kind of like with project raising we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.200" end="00:04:28.440" style="s2">finding the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.370" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">in pain right like project raising is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.440" end="00:04:31.949" style="s2">moving our project forward just in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:33.330" style="s2">different way we&#39;re focusing on someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.949" end="00:04:37.139" style="s2">else&#39;s project and finding that common</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.330" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">pain and there&#39;s something that for that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.139" end="00:04:40.470" style="s2">here in the other tag like having people</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:42.690" style="s2">come on board and help us move it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.470" end="00:04:47.100" style="s2">forward but dealing with like actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.690" end="00:04:51.139" style="s2">solutions that aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.100" end="00:04:53.910" style="s2">together tech like there and I put out</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.139" end="00:04:56.430" style="s2">on game be an alpha point and my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.910" end="00:05:00.060" style="s2">personal page and I tweeted something</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.430" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">about creating a conference for a food</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.060" end="00:05:04.500" style="s2">conference on zero slaves and three tons</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:07.110" style="s2">of carbon and I basically thought that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.500" end="00:05:09.389" style="s2">crickets hey there was no and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.110" end="00:05:10.979" style="s2">quite I mean I got some people respond</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.389" end="00:05:12.150" style="s2">to you know I got just frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.979" end="00:05:14.280" style="s2">yesterday cuz I was like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.150" end="00:05:16.949" style="s2">explaining this Velux like oh yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.280" end="00:05:18.810" style="s2">doing that we sold food like no because</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.949" end="00:05:20.280" style="s2">it isn&#39;t about the solving food it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.810" end="00:05:22.949" style="s2">about coming together and creating a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.280" end="00:05:25.050" style="s2">solution having everyday people not</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.949" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">experts right not current permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.050" end="00:05:29.070" style="s2">people and people who like know they</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:31.380" style="s2">know food it&#39;s like everyone eats so</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.070" end="00:05:34.680" style="s2">what are you currently doing and how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.380" end="00:05:36.090" style="s2">we co-create something that is Omni wind</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.680" end="00:05:37.979" style="s2">that is both bringing down our</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.090" end="00:05:40.050" style="s2">footprints of slavery and carbon but</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.979" end="00:05:41.910" style="s2">also bringing up our nutrition right no</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.050" end="00:05:43.740" style="s2">you don&#39;t I mean like not because all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.910" end="00:05:46.229" style="s2">the solutions to carbon and slavery&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.740" end="00:05:47.599" style="s2">like you pay more money you know just</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.229" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">grow your own food</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.599" end="00:05:52.349" style="s2">buy from farmers market and those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:54.810" style="s2">accessible whereas no matter what your</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.349" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">diet is if we were able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:05:57.810" style="s2">discussion and not be shamed for it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:00.210" style="s2">figure out ways to move forward that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.810" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">why I outlines on there what how I</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.210" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">thought a conference would go and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">still gonna hold the same call on Monday</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:12.530" style="s2">we&#39;ll see if anyone shows up but um like</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">something like that here but it still is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.530" end="00:06:17.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t know like I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:19.349" style="s2">make this time be how do we focus on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.370" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">solution and showcase that anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.349" end="00:06:24.810" style="s2">have an opinion and that&#39;s the power is</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:27.030" style="s2">that isn&#39;t that my opinion Trump&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.810" end="00:06:28.889" style="s2">opinion it&#39;s that I get to you know like</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.030" end="00:06:30.419" style="s2">I get to be empowered in my diet you got</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.889" end="00:06:32.190" style="s2">to be empowered in your diet and we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.419" end="00:06:34.469" style="s2">to own that our diets cost the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.190" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">carbon enslaves you know like how can we</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.469" end="00:06:40.430" style="s2">reduce that while still making choices</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:40.430" style="s2">in our own lives</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.050" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">so our Jonas go ahead if you ever am I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.950" end="00:06:53.930" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet thought directly on that one</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:58.100" style="s2">but more on a such generally for me I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.930" end="00:07:03.060" style="s2">always like to do something practical</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.100" end="00:07:05.640" style="s2">along with the theoretical thinking to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.060" end="00:07:07.800" style="s2">you know kind of prove with a terror</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.640" end="00:07:10.980" style="s2">theory is actually working out or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.800" end="00:07:14.310" style="s2">and so I really like that idea and I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.980" end="00:07:19.230" style="s2">even thinking of having this as part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.310" end="00:07:22.920" style="s2">this meeting here to think about one</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.230" end="00:07:25.950" style="s2">example how we would deal with bringing</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.920" end="00:07:27.900" style="s2">one or let&#39;s say we have three projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.950" end="00:07:30.750" style="s2">or so how we would deal with those three</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.900" end="00:07:35.400" style="s2">projects how we would move something for</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.750" end="00:07:40.110" style="s2">what and then you know going along with</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.400" end="00:07:44.450" style="s2">this kind of example to figure out where</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.110" end="00:07:50.040" style="s2">our processes of finding solutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.450" end="00:07:52.680" style="s2">finding out what take we want to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.040" end="00:07:54.930" style="s2">together whether that works and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.680" end="00:07:57.510" style="s2">think it&#39;s really it would be really</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.930" end="00:07:59.940" style="s2">good if we have this kind of conferences</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.510" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">and yeah project raising I guess as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.940" end="00:08:09.150" style="s2">as part of it to go along with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:14.910" style="s2">fixing the world Friday what making what</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.150" end="00:08:19.170" style="s2">meeting um yeah maybe all that in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.910" end="00:08:21.690" style="s2">little bit more structure or more</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.170" end="00:08:24.270" style="s2">obvious way so that people know how good</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.690" end="00:08:27.990" style="s2">this is all going along I mean of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.270" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">this is only evolving as we speak um so</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.990" end="00:08:34.470" style="s2">I guess it wasn&#39;t super consciously</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">going along together but maybe from now</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.470" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">on that could be so that&#39;s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:48.440" style="s2">brainstorming what this space could look</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:49.960" style="s2">like that is solutions focused but also</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.440" end="00:08:51.820" style="s2">fun</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.960" end="00:08:53.860" style="s2">engaging to be part of both hopefully to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.820" end="00:08:56.140" style="s2">watch but that&#39;s never the priority and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.860" end="00:08:57.580" style="s2">that&#39;s where like I had this idea in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:09:00.130" style="s2">head when I put out the conference that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.580" end="00:09:02.440" style="s2">like tons of people want to join it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.130" end="00:09:04.089" style="s2">they&#39;ll be a handful of people who want</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.440" end="00:09:05.140" style="s2">to actually create the conference and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.089" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">need the people to help create the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.140" end="00:09:10.990" style="s2">conference don&#39;t referred to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:13.899" style="s2">hosted and there wasn&#39;t interest in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.990" end="00:09:15.070" style="s2">either I was like is this not and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.899" end="00:09:17.020" style="s2">the same with like the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.070" end="00:09:19.240" style="s2">scheduling tool I&#39;m like I know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.020" end="00:09:21.850" style="s2">people need this the world needs it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.240" end="00:09:23.470" style="s2">have a social media thing that actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.850" end="00:09:26.140" style="s2">connects people so people can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.470" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">each other it&#39;s just about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.140" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">underlining infrastructure but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:33.190" style="s2">also like are we wrong am I wrong like</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:35.020" style="s2">do people not want that and we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.190" end="00:09:37.540" style="s2">created it for like the two of us and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.020" end="00:09:39.580" style="s2">I don&#39;t see that because everyone who</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.540" end="00:09:40.839" style="s2">experiences the idea cafe everyone who</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.580" end="00:09:44.770" style="s2">has a conference of starting a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.839" end="00:09:46.570" style="s2">conversation and game being that is game</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.770" end="00:09:50.020" style="s2">be like that is where the magic happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.570" end="00:09:50.980" style="s2">is in the conversations is in the not</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.020" end="00:09:52.600" style="s2">watching other people having</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:54.730" style="s2">conversations but actually having them</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.600" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">and getting to bring your ideas to it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.730" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">a group and to able to harness that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.700" style="s2">be able to generate ideas and a group of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.410" style="s2">100 but the point of the conference</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.700" end="00:10:04.390" style="s2">wasn&#39;t to figure out the food system it</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.410" end="00:10:06.520" style="s2">was to showcase that together we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.390" end="00:10:08.110" style="s2">brainstorm and some ideas can come out</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.520" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">of it and we can also do microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.110" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">linearity like form groups in between</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:13.630" style="s2">these conferences that might happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:15.160" style="s2">every two months and figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.630" end="00:10:16.779" style="s2">what&#39;s something that sparked you that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.160" end="00:10:18.250" style="s2">you wanted to move forward with whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.779" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">that&#39;s creating a garden with ten people</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.250" end="00:10:23.230" style="s2">or creating a technology system with</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:25.480" style="s2">10,000 people like what comes out of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:27.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s from the theoretical to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.480" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">real like unless people unless we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.670" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">able to get people to the conference</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:32.650" style="s2">we can&#39;t play there right like we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">have that and figure out how does that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.650" end="00:10:39.670" style="s2">move forward and stream yard has both</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:40.570" style="s2">personal boundary of like people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.670" end="00:10:42.100" style="s2">necessarily want to do it live right</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.570" end="00:10:44.410" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily want to be live</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.100" end="00:10:46.120" style="s2">on YouTube but also there can only be up</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.410" end="00:10:49.390" style="s2">to six of us having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.120" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">whereas Zune can have a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.390" end="00:10:54.190" style="s2">we can go into breakout rooms we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:57.579" style="s2">actually play with it and try but like</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.190" end="00:10:59.740" style="s2">everything we don&#39;t have the tool to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.579" end="00:11:03.310" style="s2">easily connect people to those groups</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.740" end="00:11:05.439" style="s2">and get people there and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.310" end="00:11:10.540" style="s2">just about like trying and failing in</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.439" end="00:11:12.610" style="s2">the right direction continually yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.540" end="00:11:15.129" style="s2">also kind of reminds me about every</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.610" end="00:11:17.350" style="s2">other idea I&#39;ve ever had where the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.129" end="00:11:21.959" style="s2">couple times I reach out and show it to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.350" end="00:11:24.309" style="s2">people I do don&#39;t usually get crickets</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.959" end="00:11:27.069" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if this is just part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.309" end="00:11:31.300" style="s2">the maturity model of ideas where you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.069" end="00:11:35.139" style="s2">find how to phrase it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.300" end="00:11:37.629" style="s2">people understand it with very little</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.139" end="00:11:41.439" style="s2">energy on their part in a way that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.629" end="00:11:47.589" style="s2">feel empowered or challenged or however</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.439" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">I want to say it so it&#39;s just a thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.589" end="00:11:55.629" style="s2">I had I was looking at your post to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:57.730" style="s2">if I could see anything obvious because</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.629" end="00:12:00.029" style="s2">it is surprising how often you&#39;ll write</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.730" end="00:12:02.439" style="s2">something and people just read it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.029" end="00:12:06.970" style="s2">like everyone reads it wrong it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.439" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not what this because I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.970" end="00:12:12.100" style="s2">even when I first read this I think I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:14.050" style="s2">was skimming so I thought this was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.100" end="00:12:16.300" style="s2">conference when really you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.050" end="00:12:20.649" style="s2">talking about creating a conference yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.300" end="00:12:23.379" style="s2">yes and that&#39;s fairly obvious with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.649" end="00:12:25.449" style="s2">way you wrote it whoever I switched it</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.379" end="00:12:26.620" style="s2">like because Colleen and someone else</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.449" end="00:12:28.089" style="s2">had been auditioning single names but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.620" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">like two people had comments on and put</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.089" end="00:12:31.990" style="s2">the stuff I was like clearly I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:36.069" style="s2">being clear so I swapped it and I put</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:38.439" style="s2">the new Facebook group in the comments</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.069" end="00:12:40.899" style="s2">and the document what I&#39;ve written in</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.439" end="00:12:43.029" style="s2">the document in the in the post of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.899" end="00:12:45.250" style="s2">hey this is a conference right I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.029" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">to have these five questions and work</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.250" end="00:12:49.329" style="s2">through this process then go out into</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">you know form groups I want to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.329" end="00:12:52.389" style="s2">together and discuss that is that right</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:53.769" style="s2">and then like how would we get people</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.389" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">into groups how do we get a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.769" end="00:12:57.970" style="s2">people or even twelve people to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:12:59.589" style="s2">conference what does the conference look</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.970" end="00:13:01.449" style="s2">like right are these good questions to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.589" end="00:13:04.990" style="s2">start with and work through that process</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.449" end="00:13:08.939" style="s2">together and there&#39;s something broken</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.990" end="00:13:08.939" style="s2">there like there&#39;s something that&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.879" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t want someone to come in and say</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.649" end="00:13:19.090" style="s2">this is how we fix the food system</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:20.530" style="s2">I want everyone who eats at the table</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.090" end="00:13:24.040" style="s2">saying here&#39;s what I&#39;m currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.530" end="00:13:26.290" style="s2">in and then together figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.040" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t next step we could do right what</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.290" end="00:13:31.320" style="s2">could we do with 10 people it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:34.450" style="s2">thought experiment that hopefully enacts</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.320" end="00:13:36.520" style="s2">enough actual interest to create</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.450" end="00:13:37.840" style="s2">something but that&#39;s not the point right</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.520" end="00:13:39.910" style="s2">the point isn&#39;t to create the app that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.840" end="00:13:42.490" style="s2">fixes our food system it&#39;s to see how</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.910" end="00:13:44.230" style="s2">that conversation generates an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.490" end="00:13:47.980" style="s2">I thought I was putting that out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.230" end="00:13:50.110" style="s2">but not clearly and honest I see your</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.980" end="00:13:52.030" style="s2">comments there I&#39;m just I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.110" end="00:13:53.380" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about when just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.030" end="00:13:54.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like how to actually fix the food</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.380" end="00:13:59.410" style="s2">system as opposed to how to like create</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.970" end="00:14:04.660" style="s2">this space into a solution generating</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.410" end="00:14:10.390" style="s2">our and/or how to do that off of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:12.010" style="s2">and use this to get people there like I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.390" end="00:14:14.920" style="s2">really like our project raisi I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.010" end="00:14:17.290" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome and I&#39;m enjoying having</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.920" end="00:14:18.520" style="s2">these conversations but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.290" end="00:14:21.430" style="s2">something about it switching to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.520" end="00:14:23.640" style="s2">solutions cooperative that we can do in</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.430" end="00:14:28.740" style="s2">this space of like everyone&#39;s invited</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.640" end="00:14:34.450" style="s2">how do we use this hour to create a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.740" end="00:14:36.760" style="s2">solution together and specifically this</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.450" end="00:14:41.230" style="s2">hour where this meaning we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.760" end="00:14:43.660" style="s2">right now or or the Saturday project</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.230" end="00:14:45.850" style="s2">raising or a separate hour or I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.660" end="00:14:48.250" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about that to fix our</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.850" end="00:14:50.860" style="s2">world Friday out like what does that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.250" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">look like where we were designing it</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.860" end="00:14:55.000" style="s2">kind of around a board meeting with an</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:55.780" style="s2">agenda which might be what we keep right</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.000" end="00:14:59.980" style="s2">that might be the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.780" end="00:15:01.330" style="s2">iteration but to be able to say how</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.980" end="00:15:03.250" style="s2">could we play with this our</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.330" end="00:15:06.310" style="s2">how can it be fun to come and create a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.250" end="00:15:08.350" style="s2">solution together that is solution</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.310" end="00:15:12.060" style="s2">generating the issue is if there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.350" end="00:15:15.010" style="s2">three or four of us or two of us that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.060" end="00:15:16.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not an idea cafe right even idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.010" end="00:15:18.610" style="s2">cafe isn&#39;t an idea the point of it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.839" end="00:15:19.870" style="s2">to be like this is one table of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.610" end="00:15:21.820" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.870" end="00:15:24.460" style="s2">three four or five other tables at least</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.820" end="00:15:25.780" style="s2">having the same conversation and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.460" end="00:15:28.270" style="s2">switching and having this you know same</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.780" end="00:15:31.529" style="s2">conversation again and building don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.270" end="00:15:34.749" style="s2">lean on that till we get to a point</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.529" end="00:15:35.860" style="s2">creating actual solutions and then out</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.749" end="00:15:37.240" style="s2">of that like let&#39;s say there&#39;s 100</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.860" end="00:15:38.439" style="s2">people participate in the conference not</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.240" end="00:15:39.910" style="s2">all hundred in one meeting</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.439" end="00:15:41.430" style="s2">smaller group so no hundred are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.910" end="00:15:44.759" style="s2">want to work on any project live alone</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.430" end="00:15:47.050" style="s2">whichever one is the most powerful I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.759" end="00:15:51.490" style="s2">just want to play in that space like I</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.050" end="00:15:54.420" style="s2">want to have a hundred people come and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.490" end="00:15:57.129" style="s2">be part of a conversation and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.420" end="00:15:59.800" style="s2">explain how that was for them so that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.129" end="00:16:02.199" style="s2">can make that process better and create</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.800" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">the technology so that it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.199" end="00:16:05.379" style="s2">million people having a conversation how</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:07.180" style="s2">they create their food system because</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.379" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">right now it is very top-down it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.180" end="00:16:10.329" style="s2">I have an idea and how do I get it out</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:12.279" style="s2">into the world as opposed to how can we</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.329" end="00:16:13.809" style="s2">create an idea together so that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.279" end="00:16:14.949" style="s2">already have the marketing we already</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.809" end="00:16:17.589" style="s2">have the funding because we have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.949" end="00:16:19.540" style="s2">people generating it who are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.589" end="00:16:21.220" style="s2">right they&#39;re both the people using it</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.540" end="00:16:23.259" style="s2">at the market like they&#39;re all of it in</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.220" end="00:16:26.439" style="s2">one but you first need a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.259" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">and the process has to be fun enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.439" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">that it&#39;s a natural attractor and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:33.699" style="s2">think the conference if there were</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">people there would be that because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.699" end="00:16:38.259" style="s2">can also it&#39;s a seed and then it can</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:39.670" style="s2">improve but I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.259" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">communicate it to get the people there</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.670" end="00:16:44.769" style="s2">and I jumped I said how do you get the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:46.180" style="s2">people there or the people here and do</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.769" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">we need the people here what does this</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.180" end="00:16:54.759" style="s2">look like yeah I&#39;m wondering actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:57.399" style="s2">with a um so your initial call about</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.759" end="00:17:01.240" style="s2">those projects for a project raising it</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.399" end="00:17:06.039" style="s2">did get like I don&#39;t know 20 30 projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.240" end="00:17:09.039" style="s2">so I&#39;m proposed and so people they I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.039" end="00:17:13.169" style="s2">think people have their own projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:17.140" style="s2">that I really like to work on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.169" end="00:17:21.100" style="s2">much easier to get them involved on</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.140" end="00:17:23.980" style="s2">their own projects as opposed to okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.100" end="00:17:26.919" style="s2">here&#39;s one project I want you all to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.980" end="00:17:28.980" style="s2">join and let&#39;s fix this one together</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.919" end="00:17:32.470" style="s2">because that one is not theirs</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.980" end="00:17:36.549" style="s2">yeah and so so I&#39;m I&#39;m wondering how can</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.470" end="00:17:38.440" style="s2">we create basically your post of hey</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.549" end="00:17:41.830" style="s2">what&#39;s your project what do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.440" end="00:17:47.409" style="s2">work on into this</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.830" end="00:17:52.360" style="s2">um life online sphere here and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.409" end="00:17:54.700" style="s2">split out from there yeah yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.360" end="00:17:58.059" style="s2">is like that is in what is like sitting</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.700" end="00:17:59.860" style="s2">inside is like that people love their</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.059" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">own project and that&#39;s where like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.860" end="00:18:04.149" style="s2">food idea was people love food that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:05.950" style="s2">you right like that isn&#39;t your project</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.149" end="00:18:10.059" style="s2">but it&#39;s something that it&#39;s intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.950" end="00:18:11.769" style="s2">in every area of your life and so but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.059" end="00:18:13.570" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s not their project it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.769" end="00:18:15.610" style="s2">them it&#39;s not their lives and so to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.570" end="00:18:17.470" style="s2">able to bring maybe that is it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.610" end="00:18:19.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a conference on projects maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.470" end="00:18:21.429" style="s2">a conference on not not find people with</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.960" end="00:18:23.289" style="s2">you for your project but like come and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.429" end="00:18:25.690" style="s2">tell us what makes projects hard for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.289" end="00:18:27.789" style="s2">right like maybe creating a conference</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.690" end="00:18:29.380" style="s2">like that around projects that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.789" end="00:18:32.529" style="s2">focusing on one project and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.380" end="00:18:36.789" style="s2">raise it but is focusing on does that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.529" end="00:18:39.370" style="s2">make like maybe that is the piece yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.789" end="00:18:43.630" style="s2">like that idea that the meta one metal</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.370" end="00:18:45.789" style="s2">level above our project raising is then</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.630" end="00:18:47.289" style="s2">how do we create that which is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.789" end="00:18:48.970" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about really I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.289" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">think of it how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.970" end="00:18:53.320" style="s2">infrastructures that will make these</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:54.549" style="s2">projects easier and maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:18:56.139" style="s2">infrastructure so it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.549" end="00:19:00.460" style="s2">lessons it could just be documentation</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.139" end="00:19:04.769" style="s2">it could you know what what can we go</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.460" end="00:19:06.610" style="s2">create to make these projects yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.769" end="00:19:08.019" style="s2">partly because I was like and then we</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.610" end="00:19:10.090" style="s2">cuz maybe if we have what I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.019" end="00:19:11.860" style="s2">envisioning for the food one was every</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:13.389" style="s2">other week or sorry every other month</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.860" end="00:19:15.429" style="s2">having like a conference on a Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.389" end="00:19:17.230" style="s2">for however many hours to go through</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.429" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">these questions and rotate tables and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.230" end="00:19:21.730" style="s2">then forming smaller groups that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:24.190" style="s2">meet weekly with if you want to to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.730" end="00:19:26.500" style="s2">able to either move an idea forward or</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.190" end="00:19:27.549" style="s2">whatever that looks like and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.500" end="00:19:29.260" style="s2">know if this was during our project</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.549" end="00:19:31.570" style="s2">raising our brainstorming one or whether</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.260" end="00:19:35.169" style="s2">who I had this conversation with but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.570" end="00:19:36.669" style="s2">idea of bringing like there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.169" end="00:19:37.929" style="s2">good like reasons score and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.669" end="00:19:39.880" style="s2">collection and there&#39;s things that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.929" end="00:19:41.380" style="s2">very tied together their food ones</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.880" end="00:19:43.659" style="s2">they&#39;re like actually having those</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.380" end="00:19:45.340" style="s2">people coordinator and stay together to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.659" end="00:19:46.870" style="s2">say just like kind of like what we were</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.340" end="00:19:48.700" style="s2">doing before project raising with me my</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.870" end="00:19:50.139" style="s2">brother of like goal setting like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.700" end="00:19:51.639" style="s2">group can decide right with micro</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.139" end="00:19:53.470" style="s2">solidarity they can say how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.639" end="00:19:55.020" style="s2">support each other in these smaller</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.470" end="00:19:58.290" style="s2">groups what are our call</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.020" end="00:19:59.990" style="s2">maybe they&#39;d find a way to create 19</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:03.210" style="s2">reasons for meets wiki election needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.990" end="00:20:05.010" style="s2">and creating together tech like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.210" end="00:20:06.450" style="s2">infrastructure underneath that is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.010" end="00:20:11.400" style="s2">marketing and funding and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.450" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">all of these things together and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.400" end="00:20:14.460" style="s2">funny to think we have more people in</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:15.480" style="s2">game B with their own project who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.460" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">willing to come and be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.480" end="00:20:25.290" style="s2">conference on that then there are people</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:27.240" style="s2">who eat but there was also you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.290" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">spin it in it like I&#39;m like zero slaves</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.240" end="00:20:31.950" style="s2">and three tons of carbon is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.910" style="s2">get rid of the negative instead of how</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.950" end="00:20:37.559" style="s2">do we draw in the positive right like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.910" end="00:20:39.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know the positive span of like how</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.559" end="00:20:41.640" style="s2">do we create abundance without stepping</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.390" end="00:20:43.640" style="s2">on people the environment it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.640" end="00:20:46.050" style="s2">negatives still in that spin and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.640" end="00:20:47.370" style="s2">creating your project it&#39;s gonna bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.050" end="00:20:50.850" style="s2">up all the emotion it&#39;s still gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.370" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">bring up ideas and but it&#39;s not we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.850" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">it&#39;s an easier thing to state positively</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">and drawing people I think so one</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:03.030" style="s2">thought I&#39;m having but I it may be</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:06.270" style="s2">because I&#39;m misunderstanding I I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.030" end="00:21:11.880" style="s2">think that a good place to start for</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.270" end="00:21:14.940" style="s2">this for the food idea is to have it do</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.880" end="00:21:18.600" style="s2">a project raising so do it on a Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.940" end="00:21:25.890" style="s2">and then we figure out in that meeting</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.600" end="00:21:27.300" style="s2">how to continue that part which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.890" end="00:21:30.540" style="s2">inch a question on what this meetings</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.300" end="00:21:32.910" style="s2">supposed to be but but how does it what</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.540" end="00:21:34.950" style="s2">does that resonate with you at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.910" end="00:21:37.410" style="s2">my only worry was like our next Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.950" end="00:21:39.480" style="s2">that&#39;s free is like four five Saturdays</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.410" end="00:21:41.309" style="s2">from now I theoretically cuz like</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.480" end="00:21:45.690" style="s2">tomorrow well you could always become a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.309" end="00:21:47.070" style="s2">dictator and just say three weeks is</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.690" end="00:21:50.460" style="s2">Jasper Skye and then we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.070" end="00:21:52.950" style="s2">podcast of Daniels head is named for</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.460" end="00:21:55.110" style="s2">ones from then but I don&#39;t want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.950" end="00:21:56.730" style="s2">dictator but maybe we can make this into</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.110" end="00:21:59.370" style="s2">our project crazy for that next week</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.730" end="00:22:02.160" style="s2">maybe we can put a call out for this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.370" end="00:22:03.630" style="s2">a project raising for that and invite</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.160" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">people does that resonate with people</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.630" end="00:22:08.850" style="s2">like that seems it&#39;s more focus like</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:12.419" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about with the agenda yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.850" end="00:22:16.679" style="s2">fine with that and then but to answer</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.419" end="00:22:21.240" style="s2">your question about about what fix our</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.679" end="00:22:23.070" style="s2">word Friday&#39;s would be I guess I have</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.240" end="00:22:26.009" style="s2">two thoughts on that one is it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.070" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">meta time where we talk about how what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.009" end="00:22:31.259" style="s2">can we do and maybe get more you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:34.049" style="s2">the may this is something that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.259" end="00:22:35.730" style="s2">in a project should be participating in</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.049" end="00:22:40.649" style="s2">saying what can we do to make to move</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.730" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">all of our projects forward with I hate</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.649" end="00:22:43.830" style="s2">to say faster because everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:45.779" style="s2">getting faster I really wanted maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.830" end="00:22:48.029" style="s2">more efficiently we want to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.779" end="00:22:50.940" style="s2">grease the wheels a bit it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.029" end="00:22:52.470" style="s2">to be higher speed just you know being</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.940" end="00:22:55.259" style="s2">able to make more movement with less</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.470" end="00:22:57.299" style="s2">people pushing or get more people</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.259" end="00:22:59.490" style="s2">involved more resources just working</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.299" end="00:23:01.710" style="s2">yeah I think this would be good which</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.490" end="00:23:03.960" style="s2">although I guess maybe we should change</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.710" end="00:23:05.970" style="s2">the name to fix our world Friday to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.960" end="00:23:08.129" style="s2">other one but because that that Nate I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.970" end="00:23:10.470" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that name fits if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.129" end="00:23:14.360" style="s2">really the meta project project yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.470" end="00:23:14.360" style="s2">that was always a placeholder anyway</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:19.830" style="s2">yeah I still like I do like having the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.539" end="00:23:22.950" style="s2">idea of having a meta project project</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.830" end="00:23:25.350" style="s2">meeting and then having a a single</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.950" end="00:23:27.960" style="s2">project raising or people bring up a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.350" end="00:23:29.549" style="s2">idea and then I think there&#39;s a time for</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.960" end="00:23:31.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if this is part of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.549" end="00:23:33.750" style="s2">project project or not but at a time</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.980" end="00:23:35.610" style="s2">where everybody who&#39;s running a project</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.750" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">can come in and say you know do a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.610" end="00:23:39.750" style="s2">regular mastermind you know where</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:41.190" style="s2">everyone does a five-minute update on</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.750" end="00:23:44.309" style="s2">where their project is and what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.190" end="00:23:45.629" style="s2">on and then you usually depend on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.309" end="00:23:47.309" style="s2">side of the group have one person in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.629" end="00:23:49.740" style="s2">hot seat and they get like 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.309" end="00:23:51.419" style="s2">two or 30 minutes and they can bring up</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.740" end="00:23:53.009" style="s2">a specific issue that they&#39;re having in</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.419" end="00:23:56.460" style="s2">their project and everyone brainstorms</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.009" end="00:23:59.309" style="s2">the solution so I think those three</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.460" end="00:24:01.889" style="s2">meetings would is an idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.309" end="00:24:05.070" style="s2">sounds good to me right now is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.889" end="00:24:06.840" style="s2">all three of them would be weekly or one</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.070" end="00:24:11.909" style="s2">of them is like monthly and one of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.840" end="00:24:13.649" style="s2">times was are they all an hour weekly</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.909" end="00:24:17.100" style="s2">for three meeting sounds like quite a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.649" end="00:24:19.019" style="s2">bit I would think the project were</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.100" end="00:24:22.290" style="s2">raising we have enough projects that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.019" end="00:24:23.460" style="s2">really need to keep that Weekly</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.290" end="00:24:25.290" style="s2">I do know that a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.460" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">masterminds every other week so I&#39;m have</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.290" end="00:24:29.910" style="s2">every week the Mehta project</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:31.650" style="s2">I mean maybe it&#39;d be good to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.910" end="00:24:32.190" style="s2">alternating I don&#39;t know if this confuse</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.650" end="00:24:35.010" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.190" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">but alternating wear and maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.010" end="00:24:38.430" style="s2">would work out really good so one week</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:39.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like this is our mastermind we talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.430" end="00:24:42.360" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening in our projects</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.960" end="00:24:43.740" style="s2">we we can mention a small issue in case</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.360" end="00:24:45.000" style="s2">someone has a quick solution and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.740" end="00:24:47.610" style="s2">someone gets a hot seat before there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.000" end="00:24:49.890" style="s2">actually quite a few mastermind formats</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.610" end="00:24:51.630" style="s2">we could try them and then I have that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.890" end="00:24:53.730" style="s2">alternating with the weeks where we just</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.630" end="00:24:59.220" style="s2">have an open discussion of what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.730" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">some central tech or resources or ideas</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.220" end="00:25:03.780" style="s2">that we can that we would all of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:05.250" style="s2">projects would benefit from so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.780" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">that way it wouldn&#39;t be three meetings</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.250" end="00:25:09.300" style="s2">every week for three hours already have</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:11.580" style="s2">a whole job just know I&#39;d like that idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.300" end="00:25:13.470" style="s2">also there was something about like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.580" end="00:25:15.270" style="s2">the conference for food again I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.470" end="00:25:17.130" style="s2">tied to a food conference I&#39;m more tied</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.270" end="00:25:18.600" style="s2">to a conference that like there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.130" end="00:25:21.830" style="s2">to bring us together and break us into</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.600" end="00:25:24.330" style="s2">groups to have the idea cafe or</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.830" end="00:25:26.190" style="s2">iterations on that of like you get to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.330" end="00:25:27.540" style="s2">meet with other people there&#39;s a power</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.190" end="00:25:29.370" style="s2">to meeting with new people there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.540" end="00:25:30.780" style="s2">power to having the same group right I</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.370" end="00:25:33.030" style="s2">think a mastermind group is the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.780" end="00:25:34.740" style="s2">group nante who was big conference with</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.030" end="00:25:37.320" style="s2">like the congregation in micro</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.740" end="00:25:39.030" style="s2">solidarity and then you you form your</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.320" end="00:25:40.440" style="s2">smaller groups and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.030" end="00:25:42.150" style="s2">there where like the smaller groups are</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.440" end="00:25:43.590" style="s2">the mastermind group and then maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.150" end="00:25:46.230" style="s2">is our mastermind group that we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.590" end="00:25:47.430" style="s2">every other week with whoever our little</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.230" end="00:25:48.870" style="s2">group is and then we maybe have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.430" end="00:25:51.210" style="s2">conference every two months</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.870" end="00:25:52.470" style="s2">for like a Saturday morning right that&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.210" end="00:25:54.330" style="s2">be inside of a Saturday morning you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.470" end="00:25:57.540" style="s2">don&#39;t have a project raising that week</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.330" end="00:25:59.310" style="s2">but but Pete everyone with this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.540" end="00:26:01.320" style="s2">meta right some people with projects are</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.310" end="00:26:02.760" style="s2">coming to that and forming that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.320" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">we&#39;re figuring out right I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.760" end="00:26:05.700" style="s2">how many of us there are hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:10.290" style="s2">there&#39;s at least 12 of us but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.700" end="00:26:12.360" style="s2">move our projects forward and then also</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.290" end="00:26:13.530" style="s2">for mastermind groups and as we grow</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.360" end="00:26:15.390" style="s2">like I don&#39;t even think it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.530" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">game B I have people in my life with</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.390" end="00:26:20.460" style="s2">projects who are game B projects like my</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:22.230" style="s2">brother owns a baby but like you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.460" end="00:26:25.380" style="s2">what I mean like initially it was but</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.230" end="00:26:27.570" style="s2">love of like bring a friend who has who</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.380" end="00:26:29.220" style="s2">has a project right so that we can grow</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.570" end="00:26:32.120" style="s2">that conference and those people can</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.220" end="00:26:35.010" style="s2">form groups and support each other and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:36.180" style="s2">keep our Saturday project raising I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.010" end="00:26:39.630" style="s2">I&#39;m loving all of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.180" end="00:26:42.990" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s a good trial something to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.630" end="00:26:45.860" style="s2">try out I don&#39;t know how to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.990" end="00:26:48.660" style="s2">today because it&#39;s really not my forte</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.860" end="00:26:50.610" style="s2">good but I feel like this also doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.660" end="00:26:52.950" style="s2">get what the food one did which was even</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.610" end="00:26:56.190" style="s2">when Ernesto was doing is like here are</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.950" end="00:26:57.630" style="s2">solutions to food which is not I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.190" end="00:26:58.980" style="s2">think up solutions to food we can all</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.630" end="00:27:00.270" style="s2">think up solutions to food but then</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.980" end="00:27:02.100" style="s2">they&#39;re hierarch to call it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.270" end="00:27:03.660" style="s2">need to go vegan or uni insist we need</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.100" end="00:27:04.890" style="s2">to stop transporting food everywhere as</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.660" end="00:27:07.500" style="s2">opposed to like what are we doing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.890" end="00:27:10.140" style="s2">how do we actually improve it and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.500" end="00:27:12.090" style="s2">think that does naturally drawing people</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.140" end="00:27:13.080" style="s2">if it&#39;s your project you&#39;re gonna own it</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.090" end="00:27:14.910" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be your baby you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.080" end="00:27:17.070" style="s2">want to not necessarily change it at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.910" end="00:27:20.130" style="s2">same time see the meta part piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.070" end="00:27:21.450" style="s2">like right but if we fix marketing well</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.130" end="00:27:23.790" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about your your</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.450" end="00:27:25.470" style="s2">project the the food project</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.790" end="00:27:29.660" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t say you&#39;re I guess since</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.470" end="00:27:32.690" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to co-create it is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.660" end="00:27:35.100" style="s2">manure goal of not being kind of hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.690" end="00:27:37.140" style="s2">hierarchically driven I guess really</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.100" end="00:27:39.080" style="s2">what I could think about it is this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.140" end="00:27:41.310" style="s2">place for brain people brainstorm ideas</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.080" end="00:27:43.530" style="s2">that other people could choose</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.310" end="00:27:45.720" style="s2">individually on the individual ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.530" end="00:27:48.150" style="s2">implement or not implement right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.720" end="00:27:52.950" style="s2">really kind of like co-creating a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.150" end="00:27:56.820" style="s2">resource of tools of the wrong word</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.950" end="00:28:00.330" style="s2">options you know for you to get closer</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.820" end="00:28:03.030" style="s2">to East so that each individual can</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.330" end="00:28:05.340" style="s2">exercise their sovereignty and get into</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.030" end="00:28:13.980" style="s2">in you know how and move more towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.340" end="00:28:17.310" style="s2">fewer slaves and fewer carbons yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.980" end="00:28:23.550" style="s2">there&#39;s probably a whole ton of topics</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.310" end="00:28:25.470" style="s2">that could use that format right so it</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.550" end="00:28:27.180" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t work so much for our tech</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.470" end="00:28:29.250" style="s2">cooperative because we actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.180" end="00:28:33.330" style="s2">build something physical it&#39;s you do</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.250" end="00:28:38.940" style="s2">need to the things people build have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.330" end="00:28:40.680" style="s2">fit together but for your thing towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.940" end="00:28:43.650" style="s2">just like here&#39;s just a list of things</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.680" end="00:28:45.660" style="s2">that individuals can each do and we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.650" end="00:28:48.300" style="s2">all be moving the collective forward</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.660" end="00:28:49.040" style="s2">that&#39;s as I just never really thought of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.300" end="00:28:52.100" style="s2">that as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.040" end="00:28:54.230" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting it&#39;s more like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.100" end="00:28:55.880" style="s2">space in between I have to fix my own</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.230" end="00:28:57.140" style="s2">problem right like I have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.880" end="00:28:59.060" style="s2">how to get to zero slaves it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.140" end="00:29:00.740" style="s2">possible I can&#39;t do that like food</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.060" end="00:29:01.580" style="s2">system you might be able to if you live</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.740" end="00:29:02.690" style="s2">off the land</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.580" end="00:29:05.660" style="s2">but if you&#39;re having this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.690" end="00:29:07.370" style="s2">on a computer you&#39;re using slaves like</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.660" end="00:29:10.490" style="s2">our whole computer system is based on</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.370" end="00:29:12.530" style="s2">and so to be able to Disney can make</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.490" end="00:29:14.420" style="s2">concrete decisions in and it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.530" end="00:29:16.400" style="s2">easier to tackle our food choices than</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.420" end="00:29:17.870" style="s2">our energy choices right like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.400" end="00:29:19.250" style="s2">gonna rebound my entire house I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.870" end="00:29:21.260" style="s2">renter so it&#39;s like we&#39;re both have more</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.250" end="00:29:22.940" style="s2">access to those choices like I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.260" end="00:29:25.520" style="s2">where I shop I know what I&#39;m doing for</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.940" end="00:29:27.410" style="s2">food I know the impact that&#39;s having on</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.520" end="00:29:29.210" style="s2">my body and and more easily than I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.410" end="00:29:32.870" style="s2">with my clothing or you know I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.210" end="00:29:35.750" style="s2">just an easier spot to start with um but</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.870" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">it is this space between I have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.750" end="00:29:39.770" style="s2">my own problems and the government or</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:41.570" style="s2">the big other has to solve them or I</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.770" end="00:29:43.580" style="s2">have to figure out how to get the big</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.570" end="00:29:45.020" style="s2">other to solve them right like we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.580" end="00:29:47.000" style="s2">to come together and demand they change</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.020" end="00:29:48.860" style="s2">laws which people are working on that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.000" end="00:29:50.900" style="s2">area I&#39;m not saying not to but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.860" end="00:29:52.910" style="s2">this huge space in-between of like how</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.900" end="00:29:53.870" style="s2">what could ten of us do together it may</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.910" end="00:29:55.400" style="s2">be start a community garden</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.870" end="00:29:57.620" style="s2">what could a hundred of us do together</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.400" end="00:29:59.450" style="s2">we could start a cohousing dinner right</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.620" end="00:30:01.070" style="s2">like or find a community kitchen and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.450" end="00:30:02.660" style="s2">have collective dinners where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.070" end="00:30:04.010" style="s2">sharing in our food and resources and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.660" end="00:30:05.960" style="s2">bringing that number down</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.010" end="00:30:08.570" style="s2">what can 10,000 of us do together within</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.960" end="00:30:10.250" style="s2">one city and not necessarily creating</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.570" end="00:30:11.900" style="s2">those things but just brainstorming and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.250" end="00:30:13.610" style="s2">just seeing like what is possible with</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.900" end="00:30:15.860" style="s2">that and then it naturally to me leads</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.610" end="00:30:17.450" style="s2">to tech like oh wait but how would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.860" end="00:30:19.340" style="s2">coordinate with ten thousand people ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.450" end="00:30:21.170" style="s2">people you can coordinate with but ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.340" end="00:30:22.490" style="s2">thousand you need the tech and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.170" end="00:30:26.150" style="s2">men it comes in right of like well</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.490" end="00:30:27.800" style="s2">that&#39;s create the scheduler let&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.150" end="00:30:33.590" style="s2">the way to have these conversations to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.800" end="00:30:35.780" style="s2">find the people and yeah so it wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.590" end="00:30:38.270" style="s2">tied to the food it was tied to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.780" end="00:30:39.950" style="s2">bringing that space between I need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.270" end="00:30:41.660" style="s2">solve it and they need to solve it like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.950" end="00:30:43.790" style="s2">what can we actually do that is powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.660" end="00:30:46.250" style="s2">and so part of that was what are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.790" end="00:30:48.440" style="s2">doing like I&#39;m I have things that both</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.250" end="00:30:49.760" style="s2">don&#39;t work my food system like I used to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.440" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">eat a lot of processed food because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:53.510" style="s2">what&#39;s easy and convenient cheap and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:55.730" style="s2">then I also have things that really work</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.510" end="00:30:57.320" style="s2">like oh housing and just creating even a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.730" end="00:30:58.970" style="s2">list of like well not everyone can have</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.320" end="00:31:00.440" style="s2">Co housing but it&#39;s a thing that exists</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.970" end="00:31:02.990" style="s2">quest exists which is a non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.440" end="00:31:04.520" style="s2">grocery store in Vancouver if you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.990" end="00:31:05.899" style="s2">Vancouver you can&#39;t use it you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.520" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">have a you have to be poor to use it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.899" end="00:31:09.799" style="s2">basically but that&#39;s a thing that could</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:11.510" style="s2">be started in any city right if people</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.799" end="00:31:13.520" style="s2">got together and said oh this is you</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.510" end="00:31:15.590" style="s2">know like a tool library there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.520" end="00:31:16.730" style="s2">to coordinate between the US and them</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.590" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">and I think coming together and having</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.730" end="00:31:21.890" style="s2">those conversations naturally draws in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:23.390" style="s2">the energy someone who knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.890" end="00:31:24.710" style="s2">create a database to be like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.390" end="00:31:27.260" style="s2">let&#39;s create that right like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.710" end="00:31:28.520" style="s2">conversation anyone can be part of or</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.260" end="00:31:29.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like here&#39;s what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.520" end="00:31:31.070" style="s2">here&#39;s what works for me and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.990" end="00:31:32.539" style="s2">would need to be in place for other</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.070" end="00:31:34.700" style="s2">people to do that not anyone can come</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.539" end="00:31:36.679" style="s2">and eat at our dinner at cohousing but</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.700" end="00:31:38.419" style="s2">anyone could start a community dinner</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.679" end="00:31:40.370" style="s2">why you coordinate with your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.419" end="00:31:42.440" style="s2">you could find what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.370" end="00:31:46.279" style="s2">and I just want to be able to have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.440" end="00:31:47.450" style="s2">conversation and food was just the thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.279" end="00:31:49.700" style="s2">that I thought would draw in everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.450" end="00:31:54.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s food and instead it drew in</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.700" end="00:31:56.029" style="s2">nobody yeah and I was I was thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.260" end="00:32:03.110" style="s2">just feel free to interrupt if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.029" end="00:32:06.860" style="s2">hugging the replies that there I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.110" end="00:32:10.370" style="s2">there are some wording that might bring</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.860" end="00:32:13.340" style="s2">people a little bit more I think maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.370" end="00:32:14.870" style="s2">don&#39;t see it here anymore initially like</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.340" end="00:32:17.149" style="s2">when we&#39;re using the word solution it</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.870" end="00:32:18.380" style="s2">sounds like we need to find a better</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.149" end="00:32:20.870" style="s2">word than that which I think you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.380" end="00:32:22.429" style="s2">mentioned earlier because it&#39;s Royd more</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.870" end="00:32:24.830" style="s2">like brainstorming or something but</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.429" end="00:32:29.330" style="s2">that&#39;s not even processed like a process</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.830" end="00:32:31.730" style="s2">cooperative solutions yeah I like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.330" end="00:32:34.159" style="s2">idea of like iterative or or</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.730" end="00:32:35.570" style="s2">experimental or there&#39;s got to be some</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.159" end="00:32:37.490" style="s2">sort of word for that I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.570" end="00:32:40.279" style="s2">read what you wrote for his and change</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.490" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">the wording and evolve my professed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.279" end="00:32:45.710" style="s2">collaborate and discuss sustainable omni</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:50.110" style="s2">wind solutions for our most for food and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.710" end="00:32:50.110" style="s2">promote and manage our implementation</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.140" end="00:32:58.130" style="s2">the closest thing to an elevator pitch</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.490" end="00:33:01.340" style="s2">for anything yeah but yeah yeah so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.130" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">and then there was one other little</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.340" end="00:33:14.440" style="s2">tweak to it if I think if it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.840" end="00:33:15.970" style="s2">brainstorm ideas that we can because</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.440" end="00:33:18.460" style="s2">still does sound like you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.970" end="00:33:21.009" style="s2">about you know collectively to get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.460" end="00:33:23.169" style="s2">zero slaves kind of like making society</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.009" end="00:33:25.779" style="s2">to it which your focus is more</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.169" end="00:33:27.929" style="s2">empowering individuals to do it and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.779" end="00:33:33.129" style="s2">society hopefully I&#39;ll show you follow</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.929" end="00:33:35.769" style="s2">that methods optimization yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.129" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">like it so there&#39;s all like close to and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.769" end="00:33:39.340" style="s2">not quite the right because all of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:41.169" style="s2">like every word has been co-opted so</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.340" end="00:33:43.629" style="s2">like yeah but like I must invent a new</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.169" end="00:33:46.360" style="s2">one and then explain it to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.629" end="00:33:48.100" style="s2">constant yeah and then yeah and then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.360" end="00:33:51.100" style="s2">have a lot of problems like I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.100" end="00:33:52.990" style="s2">I know like I think I&#39;ll me wins great</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.100" end="00:33:54.340" style="s2">but if I say that to a lot of people I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.990" end="00:34:00.059" style="s2">really have to explain it even though</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.340" end="00:34:02.289" style="s2">it&#39;s in the word depends on their their</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.059" end="00:34:04.990" style="s2">vocabulary a lot of people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.289" end="00:34:11.770" style="s2">understand prefixes and stuff for me is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.990" end="00:34:13.419" style="s2">great but this is maybe an iteration of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.770" end="00:34:16.389" style="s2">like how can we responsible in the City</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.419" end="00:34:19.210" style="s2">instead of off-grid advocate for modular</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.389" end="00:34:21.819" style="s2">possibility in apartments etc like what</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.210" end="00:34:23.319" style="s2">what can we actually do ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.819" end="00:34:28.569" style="s2">sorry did I take that off before you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.319" end="00:34:31.030" style="s2">taking it I mean that&#39;s good um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.569" end="00:34:32.889" style="s2">like to draw in people secure I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.030" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">not the best at asking questions like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.889" end="00:34:36.069" style="s2">kind of asked him to answer it in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:37.780" style="s2">same thing instead of like listening and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.069" end="00:34:39.490" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do is like</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.780" end="00:34:41.950" style="s2">we&#39;re asking the question like what are</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.490" end="00:34:44.770" style="s2">you doing for food and how can you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.950" end="00:34:46.690" style="s2">improve it without hierarchically</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.770" end="00:34:48.250" style="s2">imposing that on anyone without saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.690" end="00:34:50.589" style="s2">like although we need a mcdonalds</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.250" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">solution solved everyone goes vegan like</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.589" end="00:34:56.710" style="s2">we can&#39;t solve it for other people which</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:58.599" style="s2">is why this process of us meeting to fix</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.710" end="00:34:59.800" style="s2">the world doesn&#39;t work like work is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.599" end="00:35:01.480" style="s2">we&#39;re discussing is how to create a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.800" end="00:35:03.609" style="s2">process that brings in people so they</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.480" end="00:35:06.990" style="s2">can fix it for themselves right so they</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.609" end="00:35:08.980" style="s2">can fix their own piece of it without</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.990" end="00:35:11.079" style="s2">requiring anyone else like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.980" end="00:35:14.530" style="s2">invitation it&#39;s an invitation to help</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.079" end="00:35:16.900" style="s2">problem solve and word keeps coming up</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.530" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">an invitation like a solutions</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.900" end="00:35:22.140" style="s2">invitation cooperative but like if</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:22.140" style="s2">that&#39;s not doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.770" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know if I have much more to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.710" end="00:35:39.450" style="s2">add on that I also I thought I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:42.990" style="s2">don&#39;t really have anything to add to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.450" end="00:35:45.810" style="s2">that specifically um a few things that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.990" end="00:35:48.570" style="s2">could say about your food things</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.810" end="00:35:53.310" style="s2">specifically why for example I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.570" end="00:35:56.430" style="s2">join was I just realized that I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.310" end="00:36:00.600" style="s2">mainly thinking food I have food I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.430" end="00:36:02.690" style="s2">need to solve food what what&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.600" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">know I eat I I don&#39;t see that as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.690" end="00:36:09.570" style="s2">pressing problem even though of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:12.210" style="s2">framed in your way of you know carbon</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.570" end="00:36:15.240" style="s2">and slices of course it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.210" end="00:36:18.660" style="s2">problem but yeah I mean at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.240" end="00:36:25.230" style="s2">then yeah for me of course I have my own</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.660" end="00:36:27.960" style="s2">other project so I&#39;m not yeah I want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.230" end="00:36:30.540" style="s2">spend my time rather on my project and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.960" end="00:36:31.170" style="s2">on on your project but having said that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.540" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.170" end="00:36:37.560" style="s2">I would probably really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:39.740" style="s2">having some some really good overview if</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.560" end="00:36:42.600" style="s2">we create a spreadsheet of all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.740" end="00:36:49.430" style="s2">projects all the problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.600" end="00:36:52.770" style="s2">identified and so and then people could</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.430" end="00:36:58.500" style="s2">associate themselves with the problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.770" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">that they want to think about so we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.500" end="00:37:08.820" style="s2">a few problems and then you see problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:11.790" style="s2">a two people are interested problem B 10</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.820" end="00:37:14.430" style="s2">people are interested problem C nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.790" end="00:37:18.350" style="s2">really interested but then from there on</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.430" end="00:37:21.210" style="s2">you can organize a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.350" end="00:37:25.800" style="s2">those projects that many people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.210" end="00:37:28.050" style="s2">interested and potentially reframe those</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.800" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">projects that people are not that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.050" end="00:37:35.630" style="s2">interested in and then from there on you</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:37.700" style="s2">can have those breakout sessions and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.630" end="00:37:42.059" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.700" end="00:37:45.089" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m always quiet I&#39;m thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.059" end="00:37:47.099" style="s2">concrete terms no I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.089" end="00:37:48.539" style="s2">awesome but the issue is like I came</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.099" end="00:37:49.890" style="s2">like a spreadsheet and everyone adds</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.539" end="00:37:51.210" style="s2">their name and checks off what their</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.890" end="00:37:53.309" style="s2">problems are they care about which one</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.210" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">has the most checks but even getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.309" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">people to fill that out isn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:58.740" style="s2">crickets like you know what I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like people how do we get them to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.740" end="00:38:02.039" style="s2">that spreadsheet to fill that out to see</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.599" end="00:38:04.200" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the most pressing</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.039" end="00:38:07.190" style="s2">problem and then some of them can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.200" end="00:38:09.869" style="s2">solved with this method and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.190" end="00:38:11.730" style="s2">can be like everyone wants to give their</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.869" end="00:38:13.140" style="s2">solution for the world like well</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.730" end="00:38:14.760" style="s2">everyone just needs to and I do too</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.140" end="00:38:16.140" style="s2">everyone needs to follow my lead right</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.760" end="00:38:17.609" style="s2">like everyone needs to go begin everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.140" end="00:38:22.260" style="s2">needs to ride a bike I can do it why</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.609" end="00:38:25.380" style="s2">can&#39;t everyone else instead of here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.260" end="00:38:27.089" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing and if I&#39;m so up on my</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.380" end="00:38:29.220" style="s2">high horse that I&#39;m doing good and no</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.089" end="00:38:31.260" style="s2">like it&#39;s not actually a solution like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.220" end="00:38:33.390" style="s2">buying carbon offsets isn&#39;t a solution</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.260" end="00:38:34.559" style="s2">because people can&#39;t afford it and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.390" end="00:38:37.049" style="s2">very people who are creating the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.559" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">carbon can&#39;t afford it not the rich</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.049" end="00:38:41.099" style="s2">people like but you know people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:45.990" style="s2">mining because they don&#39;t have food to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.099" end="00:38:47.400" style="s2">eat like though that like how people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.990" end="00:38:48.930" style="s2">like you didn&#39;t know you had a food</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.400" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">problem right you kind of maybe knew you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.930" end="00:38:52.470" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I kind of said it like</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:54.589" style="s2">slaves and carbon like I want people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.470" end="00:38:57.480" style="s2">care about that as a problem without</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.589" end="00:38:58.529" style="s2">concentrating on that as a problem then</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.480" end="00:39:00.809" style="s2">we were spending too much of this our</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.529" end="00:39:03.150" style="s2">concentrated on the food conference but</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.809" end="00:39:05.579" style="s2">it&#39;s part of it it&#39;s like how to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.150" end="00:39:08.940" style="s2">people on board and I do almost with the</p>

<p begin="00:39:15.750" end="00:39:21.930" style="s2">thinking about making because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.779" end="00:39:23.549" style="s2">think we had the capacity to do it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.930" end="00:39:25.950" style="s2">having something like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.549" end="00:39:27.539" style="s2">having the person say what&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.950" end="00:39:30.630" style="s2">stopping point right like marketing</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.539" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">finance these these kind of things and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.630" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">possibly also having a conference around</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:39.089" style="s2">that I don&#39;t want to get experts on to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:41.250" style="s2">deal with that but maybe we get experts</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.089" end="00:39:43.470" style="s2">on steel like experts and finance and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.250" end="00:39:45.059" style="s2">how do we get financing and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.470" end="00:39:46.829" style="s2">think outside the boxing game B terms</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.059" end="00:39:50.250" style="s2">for financing and how do we do marketing</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.829" end="00:39:51.330" style="s2">but they&#39;re more meta project meta pain</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.250" end="00:39:53.550" style="s2">points meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.330" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">things that we all have in common that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.550" end="00:39:57.900" style="s2">we can create solutions floor together</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:39:59.310" style="s2">again we need people there to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.900" end="00:40:02.600" style="s2">them in order to actually create them</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.310" end="00:40:07.890" style="s2">you really think it&#39;s too hot to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.600" end="00:40:10.770" style="s2">people some amount of people I&#39;m filling</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.890" end="00:40:12.270" style="s2">in that spreadsheet I mean yeah we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:40:17.130" end="00:40:21.240" style="s2">has to be enough to get them to click on</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.050" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">it to go there or it has to be as simple</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.240" end="00:40:26.940" style="s2">as a poll right maybe it is but then I</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:28.440" style="s2">have to generate maybe it starts with</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.760" end="00:41:06.810" style="s2">for what the idea Cafe question was</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.740" end="00:41:09.240" style="s2">writing that doesn&#39;t work instead people</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.810" end="00:41:11.130" style="s2">need to be able to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.240" end="00:41:12.540" style="s2">to kind of say yes I like that one I</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.130" end="00:41:15.660" style="s2">don&#39;t like that one it&#39;s getting people</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.540" end="00:41:24.030" style="s2">to the conversation it&#39;s all chicken and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.660" end="00:41:26.040" style="s2">egg problem disappointing three people</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.030" end="00:41:28.710" style="s2">you want like thirty people filling that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.040" end="00:41:33.450" style="s2">out not three because what a conference</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.710" end="00:41:35.850" style="s2">is a bunch of people yeah and part of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.450" end="00:41:40.590" style="s2">could be wording and making an easy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.850" end="00:41:43.260" style="s2">stuff like that but part of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.590" end="00:41:45.090" style="s2">a lot of people are still you know none</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.260" end="00:41:48.450" style="s2">of us are really used to solving</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.090" end="00:41:51.540" style="s2">problems in this way cuz we&#39;re we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.450" end="00:41:55.830" style="s2">been indoctrinated into this hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.540" end="00:42:00.840" style="s2">leader led societies ya know it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.830" end="00:42:02.670" style="s2">of a chicken and egg thing yeah but I do</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.840" end="00:42:04.200" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s because it&#39;s chicken</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.670" end="00:42:05.150" style="s2">and egg once you start the egg it grows</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.200" end="00:42:07.309" style="s2">into a chicken you got</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.150" end="00:42:08.569" style="s2">tons of eggs like it&#39;s like it is its</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.309" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">own solution like if we can have one</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.569" end="00:42:13.670" style="s2">conference that is repetitive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:15.980" style="s2">enjoyable and people know it can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.670" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">improved then not only do they hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.980" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">keep coming back they also bring more</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">people with them and it does grow and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:23.480" style="s2">have more capacity of people who like oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:24.770" style="s2">I want help with this process if we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.480" end="00:42:26.390" style="s2">a way to get that information out there</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.770" end="00:42:29.089" style="s2">like we need help with this process</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.390" end="00:42:30.650" style="s2">because asking for help with the process</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.089" end="00:42:33.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to actually help</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.650" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like start the process showcase it</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.319" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">get people on board I don&#39;t know I guess</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.289" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">maybe you need to trust combine I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.349" end="00:42:46.309" style="s2">how many project Racing&#39;s do you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:48.910" style="s2">now three I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.309" end="00:42:53.779" style="s2">if for each of those project Racing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.910" end="00:42:56.990" style="s2">you have that project and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.779" end="00:42:58.549" style="s2">participants at least filling in okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.990" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">good the participants there were</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.549" end="00:43:06.430" style="s2">repetitive but at least there you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:08.599" style="s2">already have we have probably six seven</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.430" end="00:43:10.279" style="s2">maybe eight different people and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.599" end="00:43:14.690" style="s2">there are always some two or three more</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.279" end="00:43:15.890" style="s2">in the tread they would surely take take</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.690" end="00:43:17.869" style="s2">a minute or so to fill out that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.890" end="00:43:20.359" style="s2">spreadsheet and then if you continue</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.869" end="00:43:25.339" style="s2">doing that for another month or so then</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.359" end="00:43:31.270" style="s2">maybe we might get to 20 and then that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.339" end="00:43:31.270" style="s2">might be already a small egg you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.569" end="00:43:37.640" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if we just need to build</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.510" end="00:43:43.309" style="s2">participation through the project</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.640" end="00:43:44.690" style="s2">raising and other things and then when</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.309" end="00:43:50.119" style="s2">we get a little bit bigger than maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.690" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">the conference would yeah might be space</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.119" end="00:43:55.970" style="s2">for a conference in project raising that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:57.109" style="s2">like the meta like not food because even</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.970" end="00:43:58.789" style="s2">though I thought everyone eats that</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.109" end="00:44:01.279" style="s2">would be the thing but everyone focus on</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.789" end="00:44:03.619" style="s2">people it&#39;s maybe not because it&#39;s so in</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.279" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">our lives that we can&#39;t even see it we</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.619" end="00:44:06.289" style="s2">either don&#39;t know we have a problem or</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:08.349" style="s2">we have a problem we have a solution for</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.289" end="00:44:11.720" style="s2">it that we are stuck on this solution</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.349" end="00:44:13.099" style="s2">maybe trying to have a conference &#39;king</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.720" end="00:44:15.109" style="s2">the game be space if people want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.099" end="00:44:17.000" style="s2">create a conference for our projects and</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.109" end="00:44:18.380" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what I turn the money</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.000" end="00:44:18.770" style="s2">because the literally no one has wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.380" end="00:44:21.170" style="s2">to join the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.770" end="00:44:23.360" style="s2">Paul so I can turn that into that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.170" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">just see what happens you see what if</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.360" end="00:44:32.750" style="s2">people are into that into having that be</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.700" style="s2">but that also feels like the food thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.750" end="00:44:36.470" style="s2">felt very parallel to this so I was like</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.700" end="00:44:38.600" style="s2">I can just see if this goes anywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.470" end="00:44:41.600" style="s2">learn something it feels like having</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.600" end="00:44:43.850" style="s2">that without you seems weird but since</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.600" end="00:44:47.210" style="s2">it&#39;s probably gonna be crickets I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.850" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s planning the conference right</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.210" end="00:44:50.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not having the conference and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:55.340" style="s2">whenever the conference is it&#39;ll be like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.390" end="00:44:56.810" style="s2">a Saturday morning ends yeah doing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.340" end="00:44:59.360" style="s2">that way how do you feel about me</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.810" end="00:45:01.010" style="s2">changing it to the meta meta project</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.360" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">projects needs to talk about a call</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.010" end="00:45:04.900" style="s2">cards for better projects you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:04.900" style="s2">fine with that</p>

<p begin="00:45:55.490" end="00:46:00.950" style="s2">but like there&#39;s something when I got</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.420" end="00:46:02.600" style="s2">crickets for the food system there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.950" end="00:46:04.040" style="s2">also this like right we&#39;re probably not</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.600" end="00:46:06.200" style="s2">supposed to change the food system first</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.040" end="00:46:08.450" style="s2">has such a drastic impact in every area</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.200" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">of life than actually having solutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.450" end="00:46:14.810" style="s2">for and bringing people in might create</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:16.580" style="s2">a cascade of like we might collapse game</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.810" end="00:46:19.010" style="s2">a faster than it needs to be collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.580" end="00:46:21.020" style="s2">whereas in the meta projects growing</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.010" end="00:46:23.510" style="s2">them actually kind of is they scaffold</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.020" end="00:46:25.160" style="s2">the underneath society that we need in</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.510" end="00:46:26.570" style="s2">order to allow for collapse right there</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.160" end="00:46:29.630" style="s2">are people tackling the food system</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.570" end="00:46:31.010" style="s2">within that space and having I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.630" end="00:46:32.180" style="s2">know there was something there that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.010" end="00:46:34.579" style="s2">like this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.180" end="00:46:36.559" style="s2">that&#39;s right time I just I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.579" end="00:46:38.930" style="s2">patient because I get really frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.559" end="00:46:42.380" style="s2">when it&#39;s not going as fast I&#39;m like it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:44.270" style="s2">is actually going quite fast it is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.380" end="00:46:46.069" style="s2">changing iterations like the things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.270" end="00:46:49.240" style="s2">happen between Friday and Friday</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.069" end="00:46:51.490" style="s2">it&#39;s like astronomical it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.240" end="00:46:54.050" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not during this hour</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.490" end="00:46:59.569" style="s2">necessarily how do you find it Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.050" end="00:47:04.250" style="s2">speed wise and I&#39;m so self-absorbed with</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.569" end="00:47:08.180" style="s2">my own issues that I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.250" end="00:47:09.530" style="s2">it&#39;s always grindingly slow but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.180" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">just because I&#39;ve such high expectations</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.530" end="00:47:16.700" style="s2">I think this is moving good I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:19.460" style="s2">know I&#39;ve had other like the you know I</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.700" end="00:47:22.670" style="s2">think we hit on an idea with the project</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.460" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">raising so I think that&#39;s great and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.670" end="00:47:32.599" style="s2">if we do this kind of meta project</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:36.230" style="s2">Greece I think that you know if people</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.599" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">like that I think it&#39;d be good and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.230" end="00:47:41.000" style="s2">yeah I think it would be moving kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:43.309" style="s2">fast I think it&#39;s a good speed I guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.000" end="00:47:46.190" style="s2">is what I&#39;m saying yeah I you know it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.309" end="00:47:47.750" style="s2">always feels slow so but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.190" end="00:47:49.730" style="s2">we are getting some progress is great I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.750" end="00:47:53.569" style="s2">mean my other projects I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.730" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">on since 2011 so you know this is moving</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.569" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">a lot faster than that it&#39;s like I guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:01.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working just like you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:05.240" style="s2">working on from since 2011 I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.190" end="00:48:06.710" style="s2">working on mine since 2013-14 and every</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.240" end="00:48:08.299" style="s2">time I&#39;m like this is gonna go it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.710" end="00:48:10.819" style="s2">gonna it doesn&#39;t but like it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.299" end="00:48:13.130" style="s2">happening in its right pace and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.819" end="00:48:15.290" style="s2">like my healing journey with my body if</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.130" end="00:48:17.180" style="s2">I both got sick very gradually and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.290" end="00:48:18.950" style="s2">getting better very gradually and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.180" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">like even though everything I do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.950" end="00:48:23.569" style="s2">both terrified it&#39;s gonna go viral and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:25.099" style="s2">expecting it to go viral I wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.569" end="00:48:26.450" style="s2">able to handle if it went viral and this</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.099" end="00:48:28.520" style="s2">thing probably will increase</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.450" end="00:48:30.230" style="s2">incrementally until there&#39;s other people</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.520" end="00:48:32.089" style="s2">involved for more of the viral type of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.230" end="00:48:36.140" style="s2">like oh they&#39;re the ones who mark it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.089" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">get like and that is exactly how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.140" end="00:48:40.250" style="s2">supposed to be it&#39;s supposed to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:42.109" style="s2">be slow Joey and then chicken the eggs</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.250" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">hatched and then it grows up and then it</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.109" end="00:48:46.010" style="s2">just explodes and there&#39;s no controlling</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:47.540" style="s2">it then like there is no</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.010" end="00:48:51.470" style="s2">the three of us meeting to fix the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.540" end="00:48:53.000" style="s2">it&#39;s you know becomes millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.470" end="00:48:54.470" style="s2">meeting in groups of three in groups of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.000" end="00:48:56.750" style="s2">five and creating their own thing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.470" end="00:49:00.230" style="s2">using the technology to create their own</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.750" end="00:49:01.970" style="s2">projects that have no snowball is very</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.230" end="00:49:04.220" style="s2">fast once it starts once we have leaves</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.970" end="00:49:06.170" style="s2">genius on this planet and give a certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.220" end="00:49:08.030" style="s2">amount of collaboration tools it</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.170" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">explodes and there&#39;s just like so much</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.030" end="00:49:14.060" style="s2">going on you can&#39;t know everything</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:15.140" style="s2">that&#39;s going on yeah I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.060" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t been paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.140" end="00:49:22.040" style="s2">comments money saving I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:29.570" style="s2">just gonna distributed problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.040" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">groups I think are you muted your neck</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.570" end="00:49:33.500" style="s2">sitting here you just said not just that</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:37.099" style="s2">they should take part in your food</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.500" end="00:49:39.710" style="s2">conference on the project raising yes I</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.099" end="00:49:41.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know master nesto and Esther I</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.710" end="00:49:43.190" style="s2">know you I don&#39;t want to be on video on</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.750" end="00:49:45.770" style="s2">here I think you participated boys</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.190" end="00:49:48.050" style="s2">before would you participate in a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.770" end="00:49:50.180" style="s2">conference on video that isn&#39;t recorded</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.050" end="00:49:52.069" style="s2">I&#39;m just wondering like because ominous</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.180" end="00:49:54.380" style="s2">immune extrapolate that to everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.069" end="00:49:55.910" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to be on video but would</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.380" end="00:50:05.060" style="s2">like everyone like the millions of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.910" end="00:50:09.800" style="s2">people who don&#39;t so those zoom Colts</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.060" end="00:50:11.540" style="s2">they are not recorded no I mean it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.800" end="00:50:14.030" style="s2">could record them if there&#39;s like a few</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.540" end="00:50:15.980" style="s2">people in them but once you go into</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.030" end="00:50:17.780" style="s2">breakout groups you can&#39;t really record</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.980" end="00:50:19.670" style="s2">them and we want enough people to go</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.780" end="00:50:21.530" style="s2">into breakout groups so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.670" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">have a comrade small a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.530" end="00:50:27.710" style="s2">switch people and have you know another</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:31.790" style="s2">conversation I&#39;m generally for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.710" end="00:50:35.210" style="s2">personally I&#39;m a fan of recording things</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.790" end="00:50:42.050" style="s2">but not necessarily bringing them life</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.210" end="00:50:44.329" style="s2">directly like I I sometimes I think it</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.050" end="00:50:46.339" style="s2">can be valuable to you know to just look</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.329" end="00:50:50.450" style="s2">at something again and give that video</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.339" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">out as a specific reference to people</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.450" end="00:50:58.190" style="s2">also I mean I don&#39;t mind also having</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:01.220" style="s2">this one life but</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.190" end="00:51:03.650" style="s2">feels a bit weird sometimes yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.220" end="00:51:04.700" style="s2">that&#39;s important to honor because if</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.650" end="00:51:06.049" style="s2">you&#39;re you know I&#39;m being able to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.700" end="00:51:07.759" style="s2">that there&#39;s other people who are even</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.049" end="00:51:11.380" style="s2">more that because they&#39;re not willing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.759" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">be on camera at all and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.380" end="00:51:16.490" style="s2">trade-off for sure doing it and I like</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:17.900" style="s2">recording if there was I think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.490" end="00:51:20.119" style="s2">with the platform the collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.900" end="00:51:24.200" style="s2">platform if it&#39;s facilitating group</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.119" end="00:51:25.759" style="s2">video conversations is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.200" end="00:51:27.799" style="s2">record it and it can be made available</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.759" end="00:51:31.369" style="s2">but it also doesn&#39;t have to be right</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.799" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">that first sown there&#39;s millions of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.369" end="00:51:36.019" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna watch millions of them so</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:37.309" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not one person having millions</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.019" end="00:51:39.019" style="s2">of views although maybe it is we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.309" end="00:51:43.069" style="s2">our Joe Rogan&#39;s that will be people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.019" end="00:51:45.230" style="s2">get watched often but mostly it&#39;ll be to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.069" end="00:51:46.849" style="s2">look back on right to get to find out</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.230" end="00:51:49.460" style="s2">how you&#39;ve grown or to find out</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.849" end="00:51:51.349" style="s2">I don&#39;t know AI goes and and figures out</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.460" end="00:51:53.180" style="s2">what was decided and takes notes for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.349" end="00:52:00.009" style="s2">or I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.180" end="00:52:02.299" style="s2">part of the iteration doing other things</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.009" end="00:52:04.700" style="s2">ya know are necessary particularly</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.299" end="00:52:06.740" style="s2">better at typing so he&#39;s which is also</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.700" end="00:52:08.930" style="s2">different people have different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.740" end="00:52:10.940" style="s2">communicating and to find a way to like</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.930" end="00:52:12.470" style="s2">bring that together because I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.940" end="00:52:14.420" style="s2">that&#39;s harness or I haven&#39;t actually had</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.470" end="00:52:17.240" style="s2">like I don&#39;t think a voice conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.420" end="00:52:18.259" style="s2">like what that&#39;s not that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.240" end="00:52:19.789" style="s2">point like I need to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.259" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">with someone like I need to either meet</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.789" end="00:52:23.900" style="s2">on voice or on video in order to I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:26.869" style="s2">we have actually I think about it but</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.900" end="00:52:28.970" style="s2">having um cuz that&#39;s how I got saw my</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.869" end="00:52:30.950" style="s2">brain works now and I can&#39;t really like</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.970" end="00:52:33.380" style="s2">even when I type something into game B I</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.950" end="00:52:35.329" style="s2">can&#39;t stay with the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.380" end="00:52:37.160" style="s2">keep typing back and forth I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.329" end="00:52:38.509" style="s2">kinda have to put it and then go then</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.900" end="00:52:49.539" style="s2">there&#39;s also something lost in that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.329" end="00:52:51.650" style="s2">everyone needs to do that write that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.539" end="00:52:55.519" style="s2">like on Twitter or everyone yelling back</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.650" end="00:52:57.170" style="s2">and forth at each other was it what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.519" end="00:52:59.839" style="s2">think it would be really good if we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.170" end="00:53:04.579" style="s2">have both like you know we have our</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.839" end="00:53:08.329" style="s2">weekly or bi-weekly meetings and then in</p>

<p begin="00:53:08.329" end="00:53:14.310" style="s2">Facebook to to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.610" end="00:53:16.890" style="s2">yet about some of those things and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.310" end="00:53:20.850" style="s2">always maybe in the video meetings we</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.890" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">can one of us maybe can summarize them</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.850" end="00:53:30.360" style="s2">or and then talk continue that</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:32.940" style="s2">conversation because yeah there there</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.360" end="00:53:36.480" style="s2">are many people who can express some</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.940" end="00:53:42.210" style="s2">things very well on and written and to</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.480" end="00:53:45.030" style="s2">bring that in in a better wait and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.210" end="00:53:47.460" style="s2">how it is right now when you paste in</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.030" end="00:53:49.230" style="s2">some selected comments and you also</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.460" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">can&#39;t really focus on everything they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.230" end="00:53:54.780" style="s2">writing and yeah might be helpful and</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.010" end="00:53:58.050" style="s2">maybe it may be important it will</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.780" end="00:54:02.370" style="s2">definitely increase the scope of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.050" end="00:54:04.680" style="s2">that reach out to ya know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.370" end="00:54:08.100" style="s2">definitely part of the balancing and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.680" end="00:54:09.840" style="s2">issue is like Facebook isn&#39;t great but</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.100" end="00:54:11.550" style="s2">it&#39;s the best we kind of have because</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.840" end="00:54:13.770" style="s2">people are on it I&#39;m on it</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.550" end="00:54:15.840" style="s2">you too were on it but there are people</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.770" end="00:54:17.190" style="s2">who have emailed me and stuff like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.840" end="00:54:19.110" style="s2">not on Facebook how can I get involved</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.190" end="00:54:20.460" style="s2">and like well you can show up but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.110" end="00:54:22.290" style="s2">don&#39;t really know how you get involved</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.460" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re not on Facebook because none</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.290" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">of the other things are a solution from</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:28.110" style="s2">Facebook like there&#39;s discord there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:29.670" style="s2">all these things but they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.110" end="00:54:31.650" style="s2">people and you have to learn them and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.670" end="00:54:33.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re kind of on existing</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.650" end="00:54:35.130" style="s2">technology on YouTube on Facebook until</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.780" end="00:54:37.410" style="s2">we can create our own collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.130" end="00:54:38.670" style="s2">platform then actually is able to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.410" end="00:54:40.170" style="s2">those things right because that is part</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.670" end="00:54:42.540" style="s2">of having a project it&#39;s like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.170" end="00:54:45.630" style="s2">get people involved how do you have one</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.540" end="00:54:48.330" style="s2">meeting and then also have ideas and do</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.630" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">stuff in between meetings and have new</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.330" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2">people come on board and be on board</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:52.410" style="s2">right of like here is everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.060" end="00:54:55.260" style="s2">happened before without having to sit</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.410" end="00:55:00.230" style="s2">through hundreds of hours of videos or</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.260" end="00:55:04.170" style="s2">if we if we create our own website</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.230" end="00:55:08.190" style="s2">platform that has those videos and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.170" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">chat and things integrated do you think</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.190" end="00:55:14.760" style="s2">that would actually help or would it</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:16.620" style="s2">also be something where nobody would</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.760" end="00:55:20.280" style="s2">ever show up because nobody knows about</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.620" end="00:55:24.820" style="s2">it and all the energy is still in</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.280" end="00:55:26.530" style="s2">Facebook yeah I mean that is the life</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.820" end="00:55:28.450" style="s2">three of us creating it and then needing</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.530" end="00:55:31.030" style="s2">to market anything to fund it is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.450" end="00:55:33.190" style="s2">chicken and egg problem but if 10,000 of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.030" end="00:55:34.450" style="s2">us got together like if even if a</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.190" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">hundred of us got together because we</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.450" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">have our own projects and we created</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:41.950" style="s2">something that helps our projects then</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:43.300" style="s2">it&#39;s going to not only help the hundred</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.950" end="00:55:44.710" style="s2">projects that we bring to it we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.300" end="00:55:47.800" style="s2">bring people to it to work on those</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.710" end="00:55:51.580" style="s2">hundred projects and it&#39;ll work just</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.800" end="00:55:53.230" style="s2">with those people is my like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.580" end="00:55:55.480" style="s2">make something in a group that&#39;s not big</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.230" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">enough to use it utilize it and fund it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.480" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">because yeah then you just have the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.280" end="00:56:00.790" style="s2">problems over and over again but if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:02.680" style="s2">can solve the Mehta problem with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.790" end="00:56:04.060" style="s2">the Mehta problem solves it for you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.680" end="00:56:05.560" style="s2">because if they&#39;re you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.060" end="00:56:09.010" style="s2">they&#39;re bringing in people to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.560" end="00:56:10.360" style="s2">on it and like as an individual I want</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.010" end="00:56:12.130" style="s2">to work on different projects and have</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.360" end="00:56:13.630" style="s2">one dashboard to look at to know my</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.130" end="00:56:14.920" style="s2">calendar to know what I&#39;m adding to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.630" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">once know what I&#39;m adding to that one</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.920" end="00:56:19.090" style="s2">none of the things out there do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:20.380" style="s2">even the project management systems it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.090" end="00:56:22.270" style="s2">like when you&#39;re paying per team but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.380" end="00:56:23.920" style="s2">I&#39;m not like you know name you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.270" end="00:56:25.480" style="s2">not on one team I&#39;m gonna be on ten</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.920" end="00:56:28.210" style="s2">different projects a tiny event when</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.480" end="00:56:29.770" style="s2">whatever it is to create the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.210" end="00:56:31.330" style="s2">collaboration platform means we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.770" end="00:56:32.710" style="s2">collaborate to create it which means it</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.330" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">can&#39;t be a tiny group of people and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.710" end="00:56:37.150" style="s2">has to be evolving it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:38.260" style="s2">something that we can say what&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.150" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">and what&#39;s not working and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.260" end="00:56:43.060" style="s2">the scheduling tool it was like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:47.350" style="s2">first idea of the project where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.060" end="00:56:50.140" style="s2">necessarily project management and team</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.350" end="00:56:51.550" style="s2">building it&#39;s just getting people to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.140" end="00:56:53.500" style="s2">zoom call right if you have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.550" end="00:56:55.240" style="s2">people coordinating when they are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.500" end="00:56:56.620" style="s2">meet if you have six people how do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.240" end="00:56:59.370" style="s2">you know how do you get people to a call</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.620" end="00:57:02.260" style="s2">and how do you what is the process of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.370" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">conversation that works and then from</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.260" end="00:57:05.740" style="s2">there having conversations about what</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:07.600" style="s2">tools can we add to the next iteration</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.740" end="00:57:09.910" style="s2">and the next iteration and constantly</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.600" end="00:57:12.220" style="s2">looking to make it better because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.910" end="00:57:13.630" style="s2">ours and none of the ones out there that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.220" end="00:57:15.370" style="s2">we don&#39;t own together can we do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.630" end="00:57:17.680" style="s2">with right we can take pieces from this</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.370" end="00:57:19.600" style="s2">one and pieces from that one but they</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:20.830" style="s2">don&#39;t integrate properly and so being</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.600" end="00:57:24.040" style="s2">able to create something together from</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.830" end="00:57:26.170" style="s2">the ground up is the ideas we then own</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.040" end="00:57:28.300" style="s2">it and can improve on it and we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.170" end="00:57:31.620" style="s2">enough people to make it happen but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.300" end="00:57:31.620" style="s2">getting those people to make it happen</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:43.360" style="s2">we&#39;re about out of time any closing</p>
