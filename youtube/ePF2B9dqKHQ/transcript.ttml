<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">the q and A&#39;s is done</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">so again deeply appreciative of all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:23.340" style="s2">support trying to be as responsible as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">can to all of you so thank you again so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">I&#39;d like to start with a question from</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:34.770" style="s2">Carole King and she asked me question</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">about the marshmallow test and and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.770" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">it&#39;s been reinterpreted to represent</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:43.500" style="s2">economic disadvantage and then what my</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.380" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">general thoughts are about scarcity so</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">so the first thing just quickly go over</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">the marshmallow test this was a famous</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">test largely around the work of idak</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">initial and what it consisted of was you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">would put a it was under what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">the delay of gratification framework and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">what you would do is you would bring in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">a small child typically around four</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:06.750" style="s2">years four years older a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:08.690" style="s2">older you find something they like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.750" end="00:02:10.830" style="s2">marshmallow hence the name of the test</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.690" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">he would put a marshmallow in front of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.830" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">them and then he would say you can have</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">the marshmallow whenever you</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">but the longer you would like but if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">wait and it was often the longer you</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:24.300" style="s2">wait there&#39;s a increasing chance you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:27.240" style="s2">get a second marshmallow and so what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:28.890" style="s2">were measuring is how long the children</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.240" end="00:02:31.320" style="s2">could delay gratification how long they</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.890" end="00:02:33.420" style="s2">would delay before they even gave in to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.320" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">impulse in the first marshmallow and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">then what came out of this whereas a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:41.870" style="s2">series of very strong predictions now</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">there&#39;s two kinds of predictions that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.870" end="00:02:46.500" style="s2">came out of this and we have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">them distinct the first and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.500" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">one that Carol is referring to has to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:53.430" style="s2">with long-term predictions so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">ability to delay gratification it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.430" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">was purported was sometimes reported as</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:02.220" style="s2">better or at least as good as measures</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">of general intelligence for predicting</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.220" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">your future longitudinal success your</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:08.940" style="s2">long-term success how well you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">to do in school how well you are going</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.940" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">to do in your in your work life how well</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do in your relationships</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">and so this was considered a very big</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">thing it was considered one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:22.950" style="s2">mainstays of the idea of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">intelligence is something distinct from</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.950" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">intelligence yeah because this ability</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:29.150" style="s2">to delay gratification was considered</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">central now that&#39;s the one set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.150" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">predictions and address those these</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:35.150" style="s2">remember there&#39;s a second and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">come back to those</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.150" end="00:03:42.680" style="s2">so recently it was found in an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:46.110" style="s2">to replicate this study with a greater</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.680" end="00:03:50.370" style="s2">number of participants much more diverse</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.110" end="00:03:53.070" style="s2">sampling that the ability to delay</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.370" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">gratification was actually being</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.070" end="00:03:58.739" style="s2">confounded with when they did it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">they didn&#39;t find the replication the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.739" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">it was purported what they found was in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:08.130" style="s2">the earlier research there was a serious</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:09.900" style="s2">confound with socioeconomic status so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.130" end="00:04:11.549" style="s2">what they were finding was what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.900" end="00:04:13.799" style="s2">went back and did the reanalysis of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.549" end="00:04:16.620" style="s2">original data but they found was</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.799" end="00:04:20.750" style="s2">children who could delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.620" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">came from higher socioeconomic status</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.750" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">children who couldn&#39;t delay</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.380" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">gratification came from a lower</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">socioeconomic status no here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:29.310" style="s2">that first all makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">if you have brought up in a quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.310" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">wealthy environment it&#39;s not that risky</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:35.190" style="s2">for you to delay gratification if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:37.320" style="s2">brought up in a more impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.190" end="00:04:38.970" style="s2">environment it is very risky for you to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.320" end="00:04:41.820" style="s2">delay gratification so it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.970" end="00:04:44.550" style="s2">actually for children right in these</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.820" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">different socio-economic classes to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:50.580" style="s2">able to delay gratification through</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">different degree okay that&#39;s all said</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.580" end="00:04:55.110" style="s2">and then once you realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:58.290" style="s2">ability to delay gratification is being</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.110" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">affected by socioeconomic status you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:04.680" style="s2">then realize that socioeconomic status</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:08.419" style="s2">is a very powerful predictor of how kids</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.680" end="00:05:10.919" style="s2">are going to do so the kids that delayed</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.419" end="00:05:13.110" style="s2">longer came from higher socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.919" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">status and that higher socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.110" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">status predicts their long-term success</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:21.090" style="s2">and therefore the idea that the delay of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.900" end="00:05:23.640" style="s2">gratification was independently</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.090" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">predicting this long-term success falls</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.640" end="00:05:27.540" style="s2">away now that&#39;s important not just</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:29.580" style="s2">because the marshmallow test is famous</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.540" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">but this ability to delay gratification</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.580" end="00:05:35.760" style="s2">is one of the sort of central things</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:37.800" style="s2">around meaning of versions of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.760" end="00:05:40.530" style="s2">intelligence this is why I&#39;m very very</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.800" end="00:05:43.430" style="s2">suspicious of the notion of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.530" end="00:05:49.050" style="s2">intelligence as something distinct from</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">general intelligence now this lines up</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.050" end="00:05:53.130" style="s2">with a lot of increasing work around</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">scarcity mentality when individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.130" end="00:05:58.620" style="s2">put into scarcity their cognition goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:06:02.010" style="s2">through significant transformation often</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.620" end="00:06:04.860" style="s2">in ways that can be seen from a more</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.010" end="00:06:05.760" style="s2">long-term perspective as deleterious but</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.860" end="00:06:09.270" style="s2">the thing you should know is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.760" end="00:06:12.030" style="s2">scarcity mentality is not just in an</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.270" end="00:06:15.240" style="s2">economic if I put you into a situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.030" end="00:06:17.729" style="s2">where you feel you have time scarcity or</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.240" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">that you have metabolic energy scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.729" end="00:06:22.169" style="s2">so in any way in which an important</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">resource that contributes to your</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.169" end="00:06:27.870" style="s2">ability to solve your problems is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.990" end="00:06:30.390" style="s2">suddenly in your in your apprehension</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.870" end="00:06:32.220" style="s2">significantly limited you will lose</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.390" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">cognitive flexibility you become much</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.220" end="00:06:39.060" style="s2">more impulsive much more limited and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:40.540" style="s2">alternatives are considered you will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.060" end="00:06:42.190" style="s2">much more short-term</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.540" end="00:06:47.020" style="s2">all kinds of things happen if you move</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.190" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">into a scarcity mentality and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.020" end="00:06:51.730" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and like I said this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:54.010" style="s2">in one sense it&#39;s very adaptive because</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.730" end="00:06:56.200" style="s2">if you are things that are think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.010" end="00:06:57.880" style="s2">things are very scarce you should focus</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.200" end="00:07:00.040" style="s2">your limited resources on the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.880" end="00:07:02.260" style="s2">problem of the more probable outcomes</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.170" end="00:07:11.310" style="s2">forth this is important in general</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.300" end="00:07:16.300" style="s2">because there has been I think an unfair</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.300" end="00:07:20.110" style="s2">this in because I&#39;m questioning the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.920" end="00:07:22.180" style="s2">whole argument that the moral behavior</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.110" end="00:07:23.890" style="s2">of poorer people they seem to be more</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.180" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">irrational Margaret Thatcher famously</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.890" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">made this argument a long time ago right</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:33.910" style="s2">and and that is to miss the whole fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:36.730" style="s2">that people who are socioeconomically</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.910" end="00:07:38.890" style="s2">poorer off do face scarcity mentality</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.730" end="00:07:42.700" style="s2">and therefore their behaviour shifts</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.890" end="00:07:45.220" style="s2">into this more short term really</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.700" end="00:07:47.140" style="s2">flexible less creative more reactive</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.220" end="00:07:51.100" style="s2">response to the environment which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.140" end="00:07:55.390" style="s2">adaptive and makes sense all that being</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.100" end="00:07:57.580" style="s2">said I don&#39;t think the we should throw</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.390" end="00:07:59.620" style="s2">out all of the research done by either</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.580" end="00:08:01.540" style="s2">commercial because they also did a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.620" end="00:08:03.550" style="s2">of other predictions that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.540" end="00:08:06.850" style="s2">longitudinal and therefore are plausibly</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.550" end="00:08:08.680" style="s2">not confounded the socioeconomic status</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.850" end="00:08:10.630" style="s2">and this has to do with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.680" end="00:08:13.600" style="s2">manipulations and interventions they did</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.630" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">so in particular and the reason why this</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:18.130" style="s2">I think should be preserved is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:19.930" style="s2">because this evidence that I&#39;m now going</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.130" end="00:08:22.810" style="s2">to talk about is convergent with</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.930" end="00:08:24.510" style="s2">independent evidence so for example what</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.810" end="00:08:26.890" style="s2">things can you do to get children</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.510" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">irrespective of their socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.890" end="00:08:33.190" style="s2">status to be able to increase their</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">ability to delay gratification so now we</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.190" end="00:08:35.590" style="s2">can talk about this differently because</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:37.419" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about how the children</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.590" end="00:08:38.890" style="s2">come in from their environment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.419" end="00:08:41.020" style="s2">talking about interventions we could</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.890" end="00:08:44.680" style="s2">give any of the participants and see how</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:46.630" style="s2">it changes their behavior and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.680" end="00:08:49.330" style="s2">the things that seems to be predictive</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.630" end="00:08:50.950" style="s2">of an ability to delay gratification is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.330" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">your ability to do what what I call a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.950" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">transparency opacity shift this is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">step back</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:08:59.050" style="s2">and look at your processing rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:01.960" style="s2">automatically looking through it this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.050" end="00:09:04.990" style="s2">was famously done with one a girl in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.960" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">experiment who was taught to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.990" end="00:09:08.680" style="s2">that she was looking that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:10.180" style="s2">frame around the marshmallow and she was</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.680" end="00:09:12.130" style="s2">looking at a picture of a marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.180" end="00:09:13.450" style="s2">rather than a marshmallow and she</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.130" end="00:09:15.550" style="s2">famously said well you can&#39;t eat a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.450" end="00:09:17.260" style="s2">picture so she was stepping back and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.550" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">looking at her representation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.260" end="00:09:21.850" style="s2">realising its distinction from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:24.460" style="s2">object and that&#39;s affords the delay of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.850" end="00:09:27.160" style="s2">gratification and this lines up applause</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.460" end="00:09:29.260" style="s2">ibly with how mindfulness and other self</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.160" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">control strategies improve our ability</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.260" end="00:09:34.089" style="s2">to deal with our impulsivity so you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:35.650" style="s2">the media sort of presents it as you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.089" end="00:09:36.910" style="s2">know the marshmallow testers has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.650" end="00:09:39.400" style="s2">just sort of disconfirmed that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.910" end="00:09:41.830" style="s2">little like that&#39;s a little to him</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.400" end="00:09:43.810" style="s2">fisted what we should say is instead</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.830" end="00:09:45.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a confirm with socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.810" end="00:09:47.320" style="s2">status that points us to another</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.460" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">important relevant variable that has</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:54.760" style="s2">the really you know the real impact of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.450" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">scarcity mentality on our cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:00.580" style="s2">but we should also remember that there</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.870" end="00:10:02.260" style="s2">are aspects of the marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.580" end="00:10:04.120" style="s2">experience experiment that shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.260" end="00:10:07.060" style="s2">rejected because they have to do with</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.190" end="00:10:31.330" style="s2">that&#39;s I think sort of my best take on</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.480" end="00:10:35.610" style="s2">the status of the marshmallow test right</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.330" end="00:10:40.410" style="s2">now so I now and I would like to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.610" end="00:10:45.100" style="s2">a question from a patreon supporter</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.410" end="00:10:46.870" style="s2">Sergey he asked could you speak much</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.100" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">more on your concept of existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.870" end="00:10:55.270" style="s2">inertia and serious play it&#39;s a long so</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:56.650" style="s2">I have a lot of an episode that has a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.270" end="00:11:01.630" style="s2">large chunk on that I have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.650" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">separate talk on there on gnosis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.630" end="00:11:05.589" style="s2">on my channel if you&#39;re interested so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">can&#39;t give that complete argument here</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.589" end="00:11:13.899" style="s2">because of time limitations the base</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:15.579" style="s2">idea of existential inertia is it comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.899" end="00:11:18.699" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s derived from Frankfurt&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.579" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">notion when things are unthinkable to us</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.699" end="00:11:24.130" style="s2">in it I think that&#39;s also nation on an</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">older notion by James about when options</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.130" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">are viable or live options to us so</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:33.790" style="s2">Frankfurt gives the example of you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">that he has a child he couldn&#39;t simply</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.790" end="00:11:37.240" style="s2">abandon the child now what does he mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:38.980" style="s2">by that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.240" end="00:11:41.050" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.980" end="00:11:43.930" style="s2">abandoning his child and he can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.050" end="00:11:46.089" style="s2">derive implications about that you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.930" end="00:11:48.600" style="s2">how it might reduce his monthly expenses</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.089" end="00:11:51.220" style="s2">or whatnot he can do all of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.600" end="00:11:55.540" style="s2">imaginary imaginal work but what he</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.220" end="00:11:59.110" style="s2">can&#39;t do is in create a salience</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.540" end="00:12:01.630" style="s2">landscape with wit and with in which he</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.110" end="00:12:04.810" style="s2">can assume an identity a particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.630" end="00:12:07.569" style="s2">agent arena relationship such that he</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.810" end="00:12:10.420" style="s2">will start to carry out the action</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.569" end="00:12:12.069" style="s2">of abandoning and his child so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.420" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">quite like the term unthinkable but</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.069" end="00:12:17.470" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s his term so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:20.189" style="s2">sort of stuck with it so what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.470" end="00:12:23.649" style="s2">understand aim to me using the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.189" end="00:12:25.750" style="s2">explanation I just gave is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.649" end="00:12:27.610" style="s2">run the propositional and Fermi</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.750" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">propositional also means pictorial right</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.610" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">where we&#39;re using pictures as images we</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:36.279" style="s2">can run the propositions in our head but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:37.990" style="s2">we can&#39;t actually go through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.279" end="00:12:41.769" style="s2">prospective world and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.990" end="00:12:43.899" style="s2">transformations that are needed to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.769" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">the salience landscape create the sigil</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.899" end="00:12:48.360" style="s2">awareness trigger the right procedural</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:51.250" style="s2">skills and get the right agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.360" end="00:12:55.180" style="s2">participation going such so that we will</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.250" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">begin to undertake the task that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.180" end="00:13:01.060" style="s2">being merely represented in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:02.649" style="s2">propositional option now of course you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.060" end="00:13:05.319" style="s2">know it&#39;s a good thing to not abandon</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.649" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">your children but my notion of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.319" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">existential inertia is the reverse so</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:14.189" style="s2">consider somebody who can think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">that they want to stop getting into this</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.189" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">they keep going into this horrible</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.900" end="00:13:27.430" style="s2">relationships they can derive inferences</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.430" end="00:13:30.310" style="s2">like if they didn&#39;t have that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.900" end="00:13:32.080" style="s2">they would suffer less they might beat</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.310" end="00:13:33.700" style="s2">somebody better for them their</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.080" end="00:13:36.820" style="s2">friendships wouldn&#39;t be so massively</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.700" end="00:13:39.310" style="s2">taxed they can imagine not being in</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.810" end="00:13:57.550" style="s2">assume and assign identities such that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:14:00.460" style="s2">they get the participatory coupling to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.550" end="00:14:05.950" style="s2">the world that they can move to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.460" end="00:14:07.810" style="s2">place where they are a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.950" end="00:14:10.839" style="s2">person inhabited at a different arena</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.810" end="00:14:13.390" style="s2">and those deleterious patterns no longer</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.839" end="00:14:15.790" style="s2">have a purchase on them so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.390" end="00:14:18.220" style="s2">the place they want to get to is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.790" end="00:14:20.140" style="s2">unthinkable to them that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.220" end="00:14:22.089" style="s2">by existential inertia and that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.140" end="00:14:23.890" style="s2">course why people go into therapy they</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.089" end="00:14:26.920" style="s2">go into therapy because they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.890" end="00:14:28.750" style="s2">that people very rarely do not have you</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.920" end="00:14:30.790" style="s2">know good some good propositional</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.750" end="00:14:32.470" style="s2">knowledge of what their issue is all</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.790" end="00:14:34.030" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s typically not the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.470" end="00:14:35.230" style="s2">problem in therapy it&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.030" end="00:14:36.610" style="s2">when somebody&#39;s coming in and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.230" end="00:14:38.020" style="s2">trying to go blah blah you know I keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.610" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">repeating these cycles they can</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.020" end="00:14:42.970" style="s2">articulate it propositioning but they do</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">not know how to bring about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.970" end="00:14:49.030" style="s2">perspective of and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:52.060" style="s2">transformation that&#39;s all interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.030" end="00:14:53.800" style="s2">think but then the the issue comes up</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.060" end="00:14:55.780" style="s2">well what&#39;s going on in therapy that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.800" end="00:15:00.250" style="s2">helps to alleviate that now I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.780" end="00:15:02.500" style="s2">therapy is addressing both existential</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.250" end="00:15:04.839" style="s2">inertia and existential ignorance I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.500" end="00:15:06.910" style="s2">won&#39;t go into the existential ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.839" end="00:15:08.500" style="s2">right now that&#39;s the point that&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.910" end="00:15:10.630" style="s2">that has to do with the fact that very</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.500" end="00:15:15.070" style="s2">often when we&#39;re facing significant</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.630" end="00:15:16.420" style="s2">transformation we are ignorant like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.070" end="00:15:18.250" style="s2">person going into therapy we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.420" end="00:15:20.020" style="s2">ignorant of what that perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.250" end="00:15:22.450" style="s2">knowing would be like we are ignorant of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.020" end="00:15:25.300" style="s2">what that new identity will be like and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.450" end="00:15:27.580" style="s2">therefore we&#39;re we&#39;re really unsure in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.300" end="00:15:29.250" style="s2">it because of this deep ignorance what</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.580" end="00:15:32.440" style="s2">we will be losing if we make the change</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.250" end="00:15:34.990" style="s2">or what will we we will be missing if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.440" end="00:15:36.640" style="s2">don&#39;t make the change so I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.990" end="00:15:39.190" style="s2">to use the example more fully going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.640" end="00:15:42.220" style="s2">therapy you&#39;re facing existential</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.190" end="00:15:43.899" style="s2">inertia since I died I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.220" end="00:15:46.990" style="s2">bring it about and then coupled to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.899" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">and often causally related to it is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.990" end="00:15:53.529" style="s2">facing existential ignorance and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:55.270" style="s2">what you need to do is you need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.529" end="00:15:56.680" style="s2">engage in serious play so the serious</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.270" end="00:16:02.050" style="s2">play deals with the existential</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.680" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">ignorance by giving you a place that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.050" end="00:16:10.170" style="s2">an enacted analogy that has enough of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:12.040" style="s2">the features of the prospective</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.170" end="00:16:13.810" style="s2">all-knowing and the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.040" end="00:16:15.310" style="s2">knowing you want to enter into without</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.810" end="00:16:17.770" style="s2">having you fully committed to it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.310" end="00:16:19.149" style="s2">not all the way there yet so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.770" end="00:16:22.120" style="s2">you&#39;re in therapy and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.149" end="00:16:24.459" style="s2">work out a complex issue you&#39;ve had with</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.120" end="00:16:26.050" style="s2">a family member you&#39;ll engage in serious</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.459" end="00:16:27.820" style="s2">play with the therapist they may take on</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.050" end="00:16:29.950" style="s2">the role of your family member and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.820" end="00:16:32.920" style="s2">that triggers enough perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.950" end="00:16:35.470" style="s2">knowing and participatory engagement</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.920" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">that you can see what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.470" end="00:16:40.810" style="s2">perhaps transform those but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:43.630" style="s2">under the threat and notice how this</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.810" end="00:16:45.160" style="s2">would make interact with the scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.630" end="00:16:47.079" style="s2">mentality I talked about but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.160" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">under the threat of actually confronting</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.079" end="00:16:52.120" style="s2">your family member so there isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:54.370" style="s2">tremendous you know irrevocable risk and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.120" end="00:16:57.640" style="s2">so you you you get into this place where</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.370" end="00:17:01.690" style="s2">you&#39;re seriously playing you&#39;re enacting</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.640" end="00:17:04.120" style="s2">an analogy that&#39;s liminal between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.690" end="00:17:06.250" style="s2">world you and the self you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.120" end="00:17:08.199" style="s2">leave and the world and the self you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.250" end="00:17:11.500" style="s2">trying to get to and so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.199" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">mean by serious play this this enacting</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.500" end="00:17:19.540" style="s2">where I some symbolic right analogy of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">the identity I want to get to of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.540" end="00:17:26.199" style="s2">world I want to move to and I play in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:28.059" style="s2">that right that&#39;s what the enacted is I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.199" end="00:17:29.559" style="s2">play enough but I play in it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.059" end="00:17:31.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not playing in it for fun I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.559" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">playing it because I&#39;m trying to trigger</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.390" end="00:17:35.770" style="s2">the prospective woman the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:38.080" style="s2">change hopefully enough so I would get a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.770" end="00:17:40.030" style="s2">sense of what is needed that will help</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.080" end="00:17:42.520" style="s2">of course alleviate the existential</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.030" end="00:17:44.590" style="s2">ignorance what it can also help do is</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.520" end="00:17:46.840" style="s2">give you a place with and this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.590" end="00:17:48.460" style="s2">acquire a lot of our developmental</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.840" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">skills by praying</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.460" end="00:17:53.620" style="s2">in that little place I could start to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:57.810" style="s2">know how to transform my perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.620" end="00:18:00.670" style="s2">and participatory knowing and get out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.810" end="00:18:03.220" style="s2">the existential inertia so I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.670" end="00:18:07.410" style="s2">answers that question that&#39;s broadly</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.220" end="00:18:07.410" style="s2">what I think is going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.920" end="00:18:13.930" style="s2">so the patreon SIA asked me your</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:17.140" style="s2">description of symbol sounds a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.930" end="00:18:18.580" style="s2">a complex web of mental models objects</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.140" end="00:18:20.470" style="s2">that get manipulated in your head</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.580" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">enabling you to do counterfactual</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.470" end="00:18:24.580" style="s2">reasoning these mental models interact</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.770" style="s2">with each other but also sensory inputs</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.580" end="00:18:28.450" style="s2">so your experience of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.770" end="00:18:31.240" style="s2">through these models would that be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.450" end="00:18:32.500" style="s2">fair description and then says I have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.240" end="00:18:34.570" style="s2">machine-learning background and your</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.500" end="00:18:36.100" style="s2">description of symbols as a lens fits</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.570" end="00:18:37.330" style="s2">very well with models and machine</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.100" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">learning which are statistical</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.330" end="00:18:41.830" style="s2">distributions that you fits your data</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.780" end="00:18:51.370" style="s2">model will miss important patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.250" end="00:18:57.550" style="s2">the world um so I think yes I think but</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.370" end="00:18:59.710" style="s2">I think that I I think we&#39;ve got a genus</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.550" end="00:19:01.720" style="s2">species thing with it we&#39;ve gotta take</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.710" end="00:19:05.590" style="s2">care of I think the way you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.720" end="00:19:08.500" style="s2">models mental models so psychologists I</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.590" end="00:19:10.180" style="s2">have some issues with how that is used</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.500" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">in within psychology because it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.180" end="00:19:17.080" style="s2">used in a very nebulous unform alized</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:19.990" style="s2">way so putting that aside but if I</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.080" end="00:19:21.460" style="s2">understand you correctly you know I</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.990" end="00:19:23.470" style="s2">think I do because I have familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.460" end="00:19:26.350" style="s2">with the notions you&#39;re invoking for</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.470" end="00:19:27.850" style="s2">machine learning I would say that models</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.350" end="00:19:30.130" style="s2">are a much more comprehensive there</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.850" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">genus they have to do with a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.950" end="00:19:45.790" style="s2">models are symbols and they have to do a</p>

<p begin="00:20:38.510" end="00:20:42.380" style="s2">there&#39;s I unpack this in much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.909" end="00:20:44.390" style="s2">greater detail in the episodes I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.380" end="00:20:46.909" style="s2">have time to do it now but what I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.390" end="00:20:50.179" style="s2">say that what&#39;s specifically different</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.909" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">about a symbol how I&#39;m using it which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.179" end="00:20:53.539" style="s2">not the same way it&#39;s used traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:55.610" style="s2">we&#39;d like within machine learning where</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.539" end="00:20:57.320" style="s2">you put for example complete compare</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.610" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">symbolic processing with connectionism</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.320" end="00:21:03.110" style="s2">I&#39;m using it how it&#39;s used within</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:05.720" style="s2">cultural anthropology and and theology</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.110" end="00:21:08.659" style="s2">and the related philosophical discourses</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.720" end="00:21:11.570" style="s2">where as I said this specific difference</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.659" end="00:21:13.990" style="s2">the centrality of the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.570" end="00:21:16.669" style="s2">the symbol in affording the</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.669" end="00:21:23.720" style="s2">what for me a crucial specific</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.179" end="00:21:26.450" style="s2">difference between a symbol and just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.720" end="00:21:30.130" style="s2">broader class of models so I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.450" end="00:21:30.130" style="s2">answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.460" end="00:21:49.159" style="s2">so there&#39;s let&#39;s see I&#39;m just checking</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.590" end="00:21:51.399" style="s2">for the next question and just coming up</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.159" end="00:21:51.399" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.809" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">so this is from patron back to ogres I</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.339" end="00:22:08.299" style="s2">enjoy the company thank you all so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:11.419" style="s2">I&#39;ll lay the questionnaire in three</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.299" end="00:22:13.549" style="s2">parts do you think meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.419" end="00:22:17.450" style="s2">narratives are more powerful when armed</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.549" end="00:22:20.719" style="s2">with cultural specificity I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.450" end="00:22:24.289" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good question I&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.719" end="00:22:25.489" style="s2">to a distinction in in the video series</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.289" end="00:22:29.450" style="s2">that is it yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.489" end="00:22:32.179" style="s2">I haven&#39;t made that explicit but well so</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.450" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">I&#39;ll bring it up now but I will I will</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.179" end="00:22:36.759" style="s2">ask for your indulgence because a more</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:40.789" style="s2">complex argument is still forthcoming</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.759" end="00:22:42.679" style="s2">so part of what and I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.789" end="00:22:45.409" style="s2">discussed it to some degree and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.679" end="00:22:46.969" style="s2">also seen it in I think some discussions</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.409" end="00:22:47.509" style="s2">it&#39;s you might have seen it I should say</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.969" end="00:22:49.759" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.509" end="00:22:52.129" style="s2">oh wow those so so presumptuous forgive</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.759" end="00:22:54.739" style="s2">me but perhaps some of you have seen it</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.129" end="00:22:57.739" style="s2">in some of the other video discussions</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.739" end="00:23:03.769" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with people so whereas I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.739" end="00:23:05.719" style="s2">the machinery of meeting making it right</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.769" end="00:23:09.169" style="s2">in terms of relevance realization is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.719" end="00:23:14.710" style="s2">universal of course how that fits to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.169" end="00:23:17.839" style="s2">specific historical environmental</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.710" end="00:23:20.239" style="s2">context is right going to be different</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.839" end="00:23:23.570" style="s2">so let&#39;s use the analogy like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.239" end="00:23:26.089" style="s2">machinery of evolution is universal but</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.570" end="00:23:27.799" style="s2">how this particular creature is adopted</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.089" end="00:23:29.779" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be very different in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.799" end="00:23:32.359" style="s2">environment from how this features</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.779" end="00:23:38.029" style="s2">adapted etc so this is the idea of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.359" end="00:23:41.269" style="s2">know of niche construction so what that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.029" end="00:23:44.269" style="s2">means I think is that there is going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.269" end="00:23:47.210" style="s2">be your relevance realization machinery</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.269" end="00:23:49.099" style="s2">is going to tailor you and fit you to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.210" end="00:23:53.509" style="s2">particular cultural historical</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.099" end="00:23:58.179" style="s2">environmental niche and therefore to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.509" end="00:24:03.379" style="s2">degree to which you have things that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.179" end="00:24:05.929" style="s2">specific to that niche construction you</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.379" end="00:24:09.330" style="s2">will thereby increase or enhance your</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.929" end="00:24:11.790" style="s2">fitted nests if you&#39;ll allow me that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.330" end="00:24:14.160" style="s2">cognitive fitness to that particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.790" end="00:24:18.020" style="s2">environment and and what this can that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.160" end="00:24:20.460" style="s2">mean is that certain things become</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.020" end="00:24:24.330" style="s2">indispensable to your sense making</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.460" end="00:24:26.810" style="s2">capacity the example I often use is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.330" end="00:24:29.730" style="s2">English because of my particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.810" end="00:24:30.900" style="s2">cultural historical environmental</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.730" end="00:24:33.270" style="s2">background the language English is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.900" end="00:24:35.970" style="s2">indispensable to me I could not I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.270" end="00:24:38.160" style="s2">do without it I can&#39;t be a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.970" end="00:24:41.010" style="s2">agent or at least a degree that I need</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.160" end="00:24:42.390" style="s2">to be or want to be without English I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.010" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">either taking this away from me I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.390" end="00:24:44.970" style="s2">communicate</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:47.180" style="s2">I can&#39;t pose or solve many other</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.970" end="00:24:52.290" style="s2">problems that lose access to literacy</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.180" end="00:24:53.820" style="s2">etc so English is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.290" end="00:24:55.920" style="s2">indispensable to me and I think there</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.820" end="00:24:59.070" style="s2">are many ways in which your relevance</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.920" end="00:25:01.920" style="s2">realization will produce things that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.070" end="00:25:03.960" style="s2">indispensable to you and therefore your</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.920" end="00:25:06.390" style="s2">particular set of symbols might pick up</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.960" end="00:25:08.990" style="s2">on that right cultural historical</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.390" end="00:25:12.330" style="s2">environmental specificity and help you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.990" end="00:25:13.620" style="s2">to engage with those indispensible</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.330" end="00:25:16.110" style="s2">functions they&#39;re indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.620" end="00:25:17.850" style="s2">precisely because they give you a kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.110" end="00:25:21.420" style="s2">of specific you thinking you&#39;ll kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.850" end="00:25:25.230" style="s2">let let&#39;s say a context sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.420" end="00:25:28.700" style="s2">that&#39;s all I think implied by some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.230" end="00:25:35.060" style="s2">the arguments and evidence I presented</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.700" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">the issue for me is to confuse that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.060" end="00:25:40.890" style="s2">indispensability with metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:44.730" style="s2">necessity it would be to claim that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.890" end="00:25:47.700" style="s2">every cognitive agent must speak English</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.730" end="00:25:49.650" style="s2">or they cannot be a cognitive agent that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.700" end="00:25:51.390" style="s2">would be to claim metaphysical necessity</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.650" end="00:25:53.100" style="s2">now of course there are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.390" end="00:25:55.110" style="s2">metaphysically necessary for agents I</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.100" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">think age like agents have must have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.110" end="00:25:59.280" style="s2">capacity to determine the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:03.480" style="s2">of their own behavior they if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.280" end="00:26:07.170" style="s2">have that they can&#39;t be agents right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.480" end="00:26:10.590" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get at is that many</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.170" end="00:26:13.590" style="s2">things that are indispensable I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.590" end="00:26:17.250" style="s2">for it have often historically thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.590" end="00:26:22.360" style="s2">to have been metaphysically necessary so</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.250" end="00:26:27.040" style="s2">I think that particular symbol systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.360" end="00:26:32.470" style="s2">then make claims for exclusivity Ultima</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.040" end="00:26:34.120" style="s2">si finality perfection which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.470" end="00:26:36.310" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense given the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.120" end="00:26:38.680" style="s2">that relevance has no essence but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.310" end="00:26:40.900" style="s2">think that that and I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.680" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">important point and I&#39;m gonna I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.900" end="00:26:44.770" style="s2">process of making that argument in an</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:47.560" style="s2">extended fashion in this series but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.770" end="00:26:50.860" style="s2">also think that that there&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.560" end="00:26:52.690" style="s2">confound there and I sort of understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.860" end="00:26:54.580" style="s2">it because if if a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.690" end="00:26:57.040" style="s2">symbols is indispensable to you for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.580" end="00:26:58.450" style="s2">it&#39;s unthinkable in the way I just</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.040" end="00:27:00.610" style="s2">explained a few minutes ago it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.450" end="00:27:03.390" style="s2">unthinkable to you that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.610" end="00:27:07.330" style="s2">viable other way of doing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.390" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">right and and that makes sense to me but</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.330" end="00:27:14.160" style="s2">that is not the same thing as it being</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:17.830" style="s2">transcendentally metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.160" end="00:27:19.540" style="s2">necessary so it would be ridiculous for</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.830" end="00:27:21.850" style="s2">me I think you&#39;re all aware of this for</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.540" end="00:27:23.590" style="s2">me to make the 2x2 say less unless you</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.850" end="00:27:25.270" style="s2">speak English you&#39;re not an agent</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.590" end="00:27:27.610" style="s2">there&#39;s no way there&#39;s no other way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.270" end="00:27:29.290" style="s2">agency except through speaking English</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.610" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">cognitive agency you&#39;d say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.290" end="00:27:35.680" style="s2">ridiculous there&#39;s bit right no no not</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">at all okay so I think what comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.680" end="00:27:43.800" style="s2">this it&#39;s that we have to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">we have to therefore deeply respect</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.800" end="00:27:49.960" style="s2">things that have a cultural specificity</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">for the reasons I&#39;ve articulated as long</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.960" end="00:27:56.950" style="s2">as that is reciprocated with</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:58.650" style="s2">understanding that that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.950" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">specificity unless there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.650" end="00:28:04.750" style="s2">independent argument that it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:07.630" style="s2">metaphysically necessary or essential to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.750" end="00:28:09.490" style="s2">our cognitive agency that if that kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.630" end="00:28:11.290" style="s2">of argument is not forthcoming then the</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.290" end="00:28:16.110" style="s2">culturally specific thing must</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.980" end="00:28:27.100" style="s2">would answer that first question so I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.000" end="00:28:28.810" style="s2">think I answered your second question</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.100" end="00:28:30.760" style="s2">because your second question is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.810" end="00:28:33.550" style="s2">predicated on me giving a no to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.760" end="00:28:34.770" style="s2">first one and I gave a qualified yes so</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.770" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">- I think it&#39;s not it I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.770" end="00:28:51.870" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it okay so I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:55.320" style="s2">question from Alex patreon Alex well</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:58.020" style="s2">would I&#39;m very curious about absurdity I</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.320" end="00:29:00.900" style="s2">had an information recently about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.020" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">things feel absurd the forces want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:04.800" style="s2">deal with how real it is I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:07.410" style="s2">if the reality of absurdity and horror</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.800" end="00:29:10.350" style="s2">can be similar in a way to the reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.410" end="00:29:12.390" style="s2">of an ecstatic experience and in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.350" end="00:29:15.890" style="s2">could there be deep insights that could</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.390" end="00:29:15.890" style="s2">be useful I&#39;m having a bit of trouble</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.400" end="00:29:21.960" style="s2">I&#39;m having a bit of trouble sorry they</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.140" end="00:29:23.309" style="s2">just moved articulating exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.960" end="00:29:26.130" style="s2">getting at but I appreciate if you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.309" end="00:29:28.380" style="s2">elaborate a little bit Thanks that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.130" end="00:29:32.270" style="s2">really good question and I do think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.380" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">there is a deep connection between your</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.270" end="00:29:37.050" style="s2">absurdity machinery armature power</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">absurdity machinery because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.050" end="00:29:43.650" style="s2">experienced absurdity as well so</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:45.330" style="s2">experiences I think this is a fair way</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.650" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">to say it that we could describe as</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.330" end="00:29:52.290" style="s2">profound absurdity so I think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">deep connection between the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.290" end="00:29:57.330" style="s2">absurdity the cognitive processing of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:30:01.559" style="s2">the shirt of absurdity and that by which</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.330" end="00:30:04.230" style="s2">we have stasis I think in fact and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.559" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">NATO also argued something similarly and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.230" end="00:30:09.750" style="s2">of course he&#39;s the author of the essay</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:13.860" style="s2">the absurd did I make use of he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.750" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">that absurdity is as I&#39;ve argued on his</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.860" end="00:30:18.660" style="s2">behalf not driven by inference or</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:20.820" style="s2">argumentation but actually driven by a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.660" end="00:30:22.890" style="s2">capacity for self transcendence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.820" end="00:30:25.520" style="s2">driven by a capacity to move to a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.890" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">perspective that encompasses our</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:31.290" style="s2">lower-order perspective and then define</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:33.179" style="s2">that there is a clash in relevance</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.290" end="00:30:34.710" style="s2">between the perspectives so what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.710" end="00:30:37.530" style="s2">is not relevant in the lower orders</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:39.240" style="s2">perspective and this may be the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.530" end="00:30:42.690" style="s2">perspective where I&#39;m sort of living my</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.240" end="00:30:45.480" style="s2">life now interestingly I gave a talk on</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.690" end="00:30:47.250" style="s2">this recently it&#39;s what&#39;s on like I made</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.419" end="00:31:08.059" style="s2">temporally and socially etc and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.120" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">all kinds of cognitive science evidence</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.059" end="00:31:12.900" style="s2">which I go into detail in that top about</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.380" end="00:31:43.890" style="s2">right you create challenges to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.970" end="00:31:45.870" style="s2">sense of identity and their sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.890" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">agency you get colorful versions of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.870" end="00:31:49.590" style="s2">and what&#39;s called the overview effect</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:51.899" style="s2">when astronauts are seeing the Earth</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.590" end="00:31:54.090" style="s2">from space it provokes profound</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.899" end="00:31:56.850" style="s2">experiences of awe and wonder in which</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.090" end="00:31:58.409" style="s2">the bright lately and it has a huge</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.850" end="00:32:01.500" style="s2">perspectival aspect to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.409" end="00:32:03.690" style="s2">tremendous sense of beauty and it also</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.500" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">has a tremendous participatory</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.690" end="00:32:08.070" style="s2">transformation they come back feeling</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:09.570" style="s2">often that they need to transform their</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.070" end="00:32:12.630" style="s2">lives and their identities have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.570" end="00:32:14.850" style="s2">significantly altered so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.630" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">powerful stuff that&#39;s going on and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.850" end="00:32:19.740" style="s2">can and part of what I was trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:23.549" style="s2">out of the talk is ok it can go into</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.740" end="00:32:26.700" style="s2">absurdity right you can produce Wonder</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.549" end="00:32:29.539" style="s2">and awe but right if there is if the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.700" end="00:32:33.179" style="s2">person can&#39;t bring some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.539" end="00:32:35.490" style="s2">connection between the two perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.179" end="00:32:38.580" style="s2">the higher-order perspective can</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.490" end="00:32:40.590" style="s2">undermine the salience II and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.580" end="00:32:42.840" style="s2">relevancy realization and lower order</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.590" end="00:32:44.549" style="s2">perspective but precisely because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.840" end="00:32:46.309" style="s2">I mean the fact that the higher order</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.549" end="00:32:48.419" style="s2">perspectives can undermine the lower</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.309" end="00:32:50.490" style="s2">perspective is what gives them their</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.419" end="00:32:52.260" style="s2">transformational power but if that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.490" end="00:32:54.120" style="s2">transformational power isn&#39;t properly</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.260" end="00:32:57.720" style="s2">constrained or limited it can just eat</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.120" end="00:32:59.130" style="s2">away at the capacity to be connected in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.720" end="00:33:00.690" style="s2">your lower order perspective the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.130" end="00:33:01.770" style="s2">perspectives you know of your everyday</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.690" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">life and that can</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.770" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">you feeling deep absurdity so the trick</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:11.460" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the wrong word that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.900" end="00:33:14.370" style="s2">too trivial the task the task is to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.460" end="00:33:16.260" style="s2">proper training in self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.370" end="00:33:20.179" style="s2">this is again one of the reasons why I</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.260" end="00:33:22.350" style="s2">am opposed to the indiscriminate use of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.179" end="00:33:25.410" style="s2">psychedelics to provoke self</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.350" end="00:33:28.020" style="s2">transcendence again I argue against</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.410" end="00:33:30.420" style="s2">prohibition but the indiscriminate use</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.020" end="00:33:32.790" style="s2">does not give people training in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.420" end="00:33:34.679" style="s2">discernment to pull apart the self</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.790" end="00:33:37.140" style="s2">transcendence that would lead into all</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.679" end="00:33:41.210" style="s2">and wonder and the soft transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.140" end="00:33:44.600" style="s2">that can lead into absurdity or horror</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.210" end="00:33:48.570" style="s2">so that&#39;s why it&#39;s very important that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.600" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">that that the cultivation of self</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.570" end="00:33:55.890" style="s2">transcendence always be deeply bound</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:57.900" style="s2">with the project of enhancing our</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.890" end="00:34:02.730" style="s2">capacity for overcoming self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.900" end="00:34:07.320" style="s2">for you know being more wise to put it</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.730" end="00:34:10.440" style="s2">in a simple term now I think what we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.320" end="00:34:13.429" style="s2">do is we can respond to the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.440" end="00:34:16.139" style="s2">absurdity and I&#39;m going to do this in</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.429" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">not this week&#39;s video but next week&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.139" end="00:34:22.830" style="s2">video so just briefly there&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:24.629" style="s2">there are ways of playing with the view</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.830" end="00:34:27.840" style="s2">from above playing with this self</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.629" end="00:34:29.820" style="s2">transcendence and that don&#39;t trigger</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.840" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2">absurdity they can afford the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.820" end="00:34:35.490" style="s2">transcendence but constrain it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:37.850" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t fall prey to absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.490" end="00:34:40.470" style="s2">and this has to do with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.850" end="00:34:43.770" style="s2">attention and I tried to give you many</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.470" end="00:34:45.990" style="s2">examples is simultaneously bottom-up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.770" end="00:34:48.060" style="s2">top-down and simultaneously flowing in</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.990" end="00:34:51.659" style="s2">and out it&#39;s a tremendously complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.060" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">dynamic self-organization and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.659" end="00:34:56.550" style="s2">a notion you can see and you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:34:58.920" style="s2">both in Spinoza I would argue and other</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.550" end="00:35:04.760" style="s2">people in the West and also in in</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.920" end="00:35:08.340" style="s2">Buddhist practices so Spinoza gives the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.760" end="00:35:09.780" style="s2">the example of your reading his work the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.340" end="00:35:11.940" style="s2">ethics and you&#39;re following all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.780" end="00:35:15.120" style="s2">premises it&#39;s very hard and that but at</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.940" end="00:35:19.500" style="s2">some point you can get an awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.120" end="00:35:20.760" style="s2">the argument as a whole and then what</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.220" end="00:35:29.100" style="s2">sort of get the argument as a whole but</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.250" end="00:35:30.750" style="s2">you get how the argument plays in each</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.100" end="00:35:32.910" style="s2">premise and you see how each premise</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.750" end="00:35:35.670" style="s2">fits into the whole argument it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.910" end="00:35:38.130" style="s2">much like I&#39;ve shown you how you see the</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.130" end="00:35:42.570" style="s2">letters but by distinguishing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.080" end="00:35:44.250" style="s2">letters you are able to write Gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.570" end="00:35:47.070" style="s2">and integrate the whole word and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.250" end="00:35:48.600" style="s2">you&#39;re simultaneously seeing the Gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.070" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">in the parts and the parts in the</p>

<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:56.730" style="s2">and what that does is that gives you the</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.730" end="00:36:02.360" style="s2">self-transcendence well also getting the</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.360" end="00:36:07.560" style="s2">interpenetrating so that there is no</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.560" end="00:36:12.840" style="s2">would argue and I ask for your</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.840" end="00:36:17.310" style="s2">argument that that&#39;s the primary way in</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.120" end="00:36:20.190" style="s2">which we respond to absurdity because</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.310" end="00:36:21.720" style="s2">there is no argumentation that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.190" end="00:36:24.390" style="s2">driving absurdity the arguments are</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.720" end="00:36:27.120" style="s2">always after the fact what we need is a</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.830" end="00:36:36.570" style="s2">like from completely independent</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.570" end="00:36:44.280" style="s2">same conclusion that there&#39;s a state</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.070" end="00:36:46.710" style="s2">possible to us that can become more and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.280" end="00:36:50.250" style="s2">more second nature to us in which the</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.250" end="00:36:57.240" style="s2">for us but we are not torn asunder by</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.420" end="00:36:59.820" style="s2">its polar distance so I think that would</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.240" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">be my attempt and like I say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.820" end="00:37:03.090" style="s2">more on this forthcoming in this series</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:04.680" style="s2">so I hope what I&#39;ve said here gives you</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.090" end="00:37:07.800" style="s2">at least an initial understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.680" end="00:37:10.620" style="s2">that the further working in the episodes</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.800" end="00:37:11.910" style="s2">that are pretty like I think the next</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.620" end="00:37:15.480" style="s2">one and the one they&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.910" end="00:37:16.950" style="s2">will give us what we what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.480" end="00:37:18.840" style="s2">carry out I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s not give us</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.950" end="00:37:21.960" style="s2">well maybe I said give you what you need</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.840" end="00:37:26.580" style="s2">and and so that this your understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.960" end="00:37:28.830" style="s2">can be improved or at least afforded so</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.580" end="00:37:30.930" style="s2">I hope I I hope what we&#39;ve done together</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.830" end="00:37:35.310" style="s2">is we&#39;ve built a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.930" end="00:37:37.170" style="s2">understanding are you familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.310" end="00:37:39.600" style="s2">work of cognitive scientist Donald</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.170" end="00:37:42.570" style="s2">Hoffman if so I&#39;m curious to know your</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.570" end="00:37:45.750" style="s2">interface theory he seems to be</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.660" end="00:37:52.260" style="s2">we exist in a sense in Plato&#39;s cave a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.730" end="00:37:52.860" style="s2">world of illusion and that&#39;s when the</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.860" end="00:37:59.580" style="s2">vrl so so I want to I want to give a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.450" end="00:38:03.480" style="s2">very serious caveat on my response I</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.580" end="00:38:07.260" style="s2">basically only I&#39;ve watched one video by</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.480" end="00:38:10.920" style="s2">Hoffman and one argument so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.260" end="00:38:13.650" style="s2">respond on the on the understanding a</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.920" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">social contract here and now that my</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.650" end="00:38:18.900" style="s2">understanding it is limited so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">respond to the argument I saw and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.900" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">the problem I have with the argument the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:28.530" style="s2">argument seems to run off and see this</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:36.170" style="s2">this goes to I think the words essential</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.530" end="00:38:36.170" style="s2">issue the the the central issue is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.500" end="00:38:42.750" style="s2">realness is a comparative term something</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.410" end="00:38:48.690" style="s2">you can only determine if something is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.750" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">real right in conflict so in contrast to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.690" end="00:38:53.850" style="s2">how an illusion has been overcome</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:57.000" style="s2">reality is always a comparative term</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.850" end="00:39:02.340" style="s2">this is more real than that because I I</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.000" end="00:39:05.250" style="s2">I can see from here how I was limited or</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.340" end="00:39:08.310" style="s2">self-deceived there now of course that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.250" end="00:39:10.920" style="s2">means I precisely not seeing here how</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.310" end="00:39:12.900" style="s2">I&#39;m self deceived or limited I have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.920" end="00:39:14.610" style="s2">move here and so on and so forth and of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.900" end="00:39:17.490" style="s2">course that means we can never be</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.610" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">completely free from self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.490" end="00:39:21.210" style="s2">because that would mean we&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:24.060" style="s2">leap out of our capacity for framing</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.210" end="00:39:27.380" style="s2">which I think would be complete</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.060" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">cognitive suicide so let&#39;s take that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.380" end="00:39:32.220" style="s2">realness is a comparative term and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:36.290" style="s2">think that&#39;s actually operational in</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.220" end="00:39:40.859" style="s2">Hoffman&#39;s argument he takes it as real</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.290" end="00:39:44.579" style="s2">that the evolution has occurred</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.859" end="00:39:47.190" style="s2">he takes it as real that certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.579" end="00:39:49.709" style="s2">scientific measurements have given us</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.190" end="00:39:54.900" style="s2">access to the causal and historical</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.709" end="00:39:58.109" style="s2">patterns of the world if you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.900" end="00:40:00.599" style="s2">on the basis of how evolution operates I</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.109" end="00:40:03.660" style="s2">conclude that we are all in an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.599" end="00:40:06.059" style="s2">I want to know why you think your</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.660" end="00:40:07.789" style="s2">information about evolution is not just</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.059" end="00:40:11.400" style="s2">itself the losery</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.789" end="00:40:16.529" style="s2">if I if I was in a dream if I was in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.400" end="00:40:19.140" style="s2">matrix in the matrix feeding me all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.529" end="00:40:21.299" style="s2">this data within my labs or in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.140" end="00:40:23.819" style="s2">archeological investigations about</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.299" end="00:40:28.410" style="s2">biology and evolution that would also be</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.819" end="00:40:32.069" style="s2">illusory see the thing is it makes no</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.410" end="00:40:33.450" style="s2">sense to me for the reasons I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.069" end="00:40:36.690" style="s2">to articulate that we could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.450" end="00:40:38.640" style="s2">comprehensively in an illusion because</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.690" end="00:40:40.469" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing on the basis of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:42.239" style="s2">nothing forming the basis of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.469" end="00:40:44.519" style="s2">comparison now might what he might be</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.239" end="00:40:48.180" style="s2">saying is well a lot of our experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.519" end="00:40:51.269" style="s2">is illusory that&#39;s and then yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.180" end="00:40:53.849" style="s2">great and then it&#39;s like not my answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.269" end="00:40:55.650" style="s2">to that is yeah we sort of have known</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.849" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">that since the axial revolution that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.650" end="00:41:00.449" style="s2">lot of our experiences losery so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:03.900" style="s2">problem I seem to have with his argument</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.449" end="00:41:06.539" style="s2">is it seems to equivocate it does what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.900" end="00:41:08.309" style="s2">you know kind of maybe a DVD or a</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.539" end="00:41:11.339" style="s2">motte-and-bailey kind of thing it seems</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.309" end="00:41:13.469" style="s2">to equivocate from something that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.339" end="00:41:15.690" style="s2">trivial in the sense that we have known</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.469" end="00:41:19.469" style="s2">it for a very long time to be true which</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.690" end="00:41:23.339" style="s2">is much much of our experience much of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.469" end="00:41:25.819" style="s2">our conceptions are illusory with which</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.339" end="00:41:29.009" style="s2">like I said we we&#39;ve thought this</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.819" end="00:41:33.029" style="s2">comprehensively right since the Axio</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.009" end="00:41:35.819" style="s2">revolution with a radical claim which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.029" end="00:41:37.799" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all an illusion what and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.819" end="00:41:39.630" style="s2">that&#39;s just I think when you make that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.799" end="00:41:42.749" style="s2">claim you just drop down a Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.630" end="00:41:44.849" style="s2">well and with David Hume in which the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.749" end="00:41:46.829" style="s2">the only thing that&#39;s not an illusion is</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.849" end="00:41:50.309" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.829" end="00:41:52.430" style="s2">solipsistic we isolated in your present</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.309" end="00:41:54.280" style="s2">experience because everything else is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.430" end="00:41:56.800" style="s2">inferred</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.280" end="00:41:59.230" style="s2">and if that machinery is ultimately a</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.230" end="00:42:04.900" style="s2">something happened five seconds ago</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.500" end="00:42:10.080" style="s2">becomes right open to being open to the</p>

<p begin="00:42:10.080" end="00:42:17.530" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need to know on how he&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.070" end="00:42:19.990" style="s2">I need to know more and I copy added</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.530" end="00:42:22.780" style="s2">this by saying I only watched the one</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.990" end="00:42:24.040" style="s2">thing saw the one argument it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.780" end="00:42:25.869" style="s2">short video there was I think was an</p>

<p begin="00:42:25.869" end="00:42:30.609" style="s2">not the man&#39;s entire body of work and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.000" end="00:42:33.460" style="s2">I&#39;m acknowledging right now that I might</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.609" end="00:42:35.080" style="s2">be unfair to him but insofar as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.460" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">seen people talking about the argument</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.080" end="00:42:43.630" style="s2">and the way the the patreon asked me the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:45.550" style="s2">question but this is right the if we you</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.630" end="00:42:47.109" style="s2">know not only is it an epistemic thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.550" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">like how could how could it possibly all</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.109" end="00:42:51.490" style="s2">be an illusion on the basis of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:53.410" style="s2">would we point to like I mean I have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.490" end="00:42:55.960" style="s2">do it on the basis of X I can point to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.410" end="00:42:57.820" style="s2">this and say that&#39;s his illusion but at</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.960" end="00:42:59.710" style="s2">everything I point to is an illusion I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.820" end="00:43:01.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have the basis for calling</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.710" end="00:43:04.300" style="s2">anything else an illusion it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.900" end="00:43:08.380" style="s2">exactly equivalent to saying everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.300" end="00:43:10.770" style="s2">is real it&#39;s exactly equivalent to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.380" end="00:43:13.869" style="s2">saying everything is real because</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.770" end="00:43:16.750" style="s2">everything has the same epistemic status</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.869" end="00:43:18.849" style="s2">and if I have nothing to contrast it</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.750" end="00:43:21.730" style="s2">with there&#39;s no difference between</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.849" end="00:43:24.460" style="s2">saying everything&#39;s an illusion and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.730" end="00:43:25.690" style="s2">everything&#39;s real they&#39;re both equally I</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.460" end="00:43:26.589" style="s2">would say meaningless because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.690" end="00:43:28.450" style="s2">misusing terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.589" end="00:43:32.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like saying what&#39;s north of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.450" end="00:43:36.910" style="s2">North Pole also if we&#39;re in an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.950" end="00:43:40.450" style="s2">that we have no way of escaping from why</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.910" end="00:43:44.050" style="s2">would you care what possible difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.450" end="00:43:47.290" style="s2">could it make it kit you it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.050" end="00:43:49.510" style="s2">irrational to devote any attention or</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.290" end="00:43:53.470" style="s2">effort to things that can make</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.510" end="00:43:55.960" style="s2">absolutely no difference at all to what</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.470" end="00:44:00.820" style="s2">you believe what you know what you judge</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.960" end="00:44:02.380" style="s2">what you act so I you know I I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.820" end="00:44:06.070" style="s2">afraid I&#39;ve conveyed something that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.380" end="00:44:09.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to which is I may have come</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.070" end="00:44:13.360" style="s2">across as a little too harsh</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.010" end="00:44:16.360" style="s2">but that&#39;s just a because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.360" end="00:44:19.960" style="s2">direct that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.360" end="00:44:25.240" style="s2">very I&#39;m very concerned about really</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.960" end="00:44:28.210" style="s2">careful use of real and realness and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.240" end="00:44:31.600" style="s2">things like that and I guess in the end</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.210" end="00:44:33.370" style="s2">here I still side with play-doh right</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.600" end="00:44:38.080" style="s2">you only know you&#39;re in Plato&#39;s cave</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.370" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">because you can leave the cave you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.080" end="00:44:42.760" style="s2">see the fire it&#39;s only when you see the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:44.440" style="s2">fire that you realize you were only what</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.760" end="00:44:46.390" style="s2">looking at shadows it&#39;s only when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.440" end="00:44:48.250" style="s2">walk up the path and into the broad</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.390" end="00:44:50.760" style="s2">daylight do you realize that you were</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.250" end="00:44:59.770" style="s2">trapped underground so that&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.760" end="00:45:02.920" style="s2">my response there I would like to thank</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.770" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">Pete John soft for your continuing</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:20.110" style="s2">amazing and I I mean when one engages in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.310" end="00:45:25.090" style="s2">a project like this one one of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.110" end="00:45:27.010" style="s2">hopes that it will find purchase that</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.090" end="00:45:29.860" style="s2">people will find resonance with it that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.010" end="00:45:35.500" style="s2">it will come to matter to people in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.860" end="00:45:38.950" style="s2">way that affords them amelioration of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.500" end="00:45:41.800" style="s2">issues or enhancing and moving towards</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.800" end="00:45:46.810" style="s2">individually or collectively and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.170" end="00:45:53.380" style="s2">thought that that has actually happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.810" end="00:45:54.850" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s gone beyond my hopes it</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.380" end="00:45:57.970" style="s2">really matters to me to try and make a</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.850" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">difference to the mini crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.970" end="00:46:08.260" style="s2">fact that people are wanting to support</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:13.270" style="s2">that project with their money and other</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.260" end="00:46:15.490" style="s2">people with time and talent words are</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.270" end="00:46:19.240" style="s2">sort of inadequate here it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.490" end="00:46:21.640" style="s2">it&#39;s tremendously encouraging it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.240" end="00:46:25.000" style="s2">tremendously empowering it</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.640" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">it motivates me to do more I&#39;m going I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.000" end="00:46:30.760" style="s2">in the process of working on on on a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:34.360" style="s2">follow up series so I just wanna I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.760" end="00:46:36.820" style="s2">wanna I just want to say that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.360" end="00:46:38.830" style="s2">remind you all about something I said at</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.820" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">beginning we&#39;re opening up some limited</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.830" end="00:46:44.410" style="s2">spots on to new tiers which include</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:46.090" style="s2">access to my time which is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.410" end="00:46:48.040" style="s2">increasingly limited precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.090" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">this prop this project and the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.040" end="00:46:57.750" style="s2">are forthcoming you know are taking off</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">and again very grateful for that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.750" end="00:47:06.700" style="s2">those will be live at the end of the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:09.610" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to switch off now in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.700" end="00:47:13.980" style="s2">last few minutes and switch off of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.610" end="00:47:17.110" style="s2">patreon questions to some live questions</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.980" end="00:47:18.730" style="s2">here&#39;s the first one these these more</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.110" end="00:47:21.010" style="s2">personal ones are always sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.730" end="00:47:22.980" style="s2">intriguing and mysterious to me if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.010" end="00:47:26.470" style="s2">could have a superpower what would it be</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.980" end="00:47:29.410" style="s2">your favorite superhero well I suppose I</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.470" end="00:47:34.210" style="s2">mean I&#39;m under a bit of an obligation</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.410" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">here because of Amara&#39;s here and he and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.210" end="00:47:42.100" style="s2">I play a role-playing game together in</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:44.920" style="s2">which we actually assume superpowers so</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.100" end="00:47:47.800" style="s2">I guess the most honest answer would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.920" end="00:47:51.940" style="s2">to talk a little bit about what that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.800" end="00:47:54.820" style="s2">looks like for me so my character</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.940" end="00:47:57.850" style="s2">basically is kind of like Yoda he could</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.820" end="00:48:00.520" style="s2">do sort of super Taichi and he can feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.850" end="00:48:04.540" style="s2">like from Taoism he can feel the Chi and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.520" end="00:48:07.600" style="s2">work with it and he uses that generally</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.540" end="00:48:09.880" style="s2">as a way of trying to get at the depths</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.600" end="00:48:11.170" style="s2">of things and come to a more wise</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.880" end="00:48:13.090" style="s2">interaction with the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.170" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">well of course along the way doing lots</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.090" end="00:48:16.390" style="s2">of what-ho and let&#39;s get into action of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:20.080" style="s2">all that kind of stuff because they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.390" end="00:48:23.350" style="s2">have to roll it as a game so I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.080" end="00:48:27.190" style="s2">in one situation how I would extend my</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.350" end="00:48:29.710" style="s2">answer is I would superpowers that sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.190" end="00:48:31.630" style="s2">of enhanced of the sages that I try to</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.710" end="00:48:33.010" style="s2">internalize would be this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.630" end="00:48:34.810" style="s2">superpowers of like to have I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.010" end="00:48:37.330" style="s2">have like I said</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.810" end="00:48:40.180" style="s2">like you know that the capacity with Chi</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.330" end="00:48:46.060" style="s2">that I see in the Taoist masters I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.180" end="00:48:49.660" style="s2">to have Socrates&#39;s capacity for dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.060" end="00:48:52.740" style="s2">and dialectic and self transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.660" end="00:48:55.540" style="s2">the integration of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.740" end="00:49:01.150" style="s2">spirituality and existential involvement</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.540" end="00:49:03.960" style="s2">and concern to have that that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.150" end="00:49:09.550" style="s2">it&#39;s practically a superpower</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.960" end="00:49:13.420" style="s2">even in him but III would I would dearly</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.550" end="00:49:15.970" style="s2">love that to have the capacity now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.420" end="00:49:18.010" style="s2">be clear I I mean this respectfully I</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.970" end="00:49:20.650" style="s2">hope people are getting this but to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.010" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">a capacity like a super human capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.650" end="00:49:26.080" style="s2">for a gothic love which was perhaps is</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:27.580" style="s2">this is this not religious I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.080" end="00:49:30.370" style="s2">intend it to be was this perhaps what we</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.580" end="00:49:36.370" style="s2">saw in Jesus of mathur&#39;s to have that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.370" end="00:49:40.720" style="s2">also because of thinking the tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.370" end="00:49:43.540" style="s2">capacity we make persons as I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">to argue with agape so those are those</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.540" end="00:49:49.060" style="s2">are the three super powers I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.000" end="00:49:51.300" style="s2">have that that that that more deep in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.060" end="00:49:55.060" style="s2">measurement of mind and body and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.300" end="00:49:57.730" style="s2">embodied in body brain and world that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.060" end="00:50:03.250" style="s2">exemplified in the Taoist masters to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.730" end="00:50:10.290" style="s2">have Socrates is mastery of dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.250" end="00:50:10.290" style="s2">dialectic and again I hope it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.380" end="00:50:15.730" style="s2">luckily just to have Jesus capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.260" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">adopting those would be the superpowers</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.730" end="00:50:19.750" style="s2">I would most like to have because the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:21.250" style="s2">other one strike me as ones that I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.750" end="00:50:22.690" style="s2">get bored of within about three or four</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.250" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">days I can cast lightning out of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.690" end="00:50:26.950" style="s2">fingers okay I do that for a day or two</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:29.050" style="s2">and then what I&#39;m back to I&#39;m miserable</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.950" end="00:50:31.510" style="s2">I don&#39;t have meaning I&#39;m not doing well</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.050" end="00:50:32.910" style="s2">of my relationships right but this what</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.510" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">the superpowers that I&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.910" end="00:50:39.370" style="s2">super Qi and super agape and super</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:43.000" style="s2">dialectic I would be able to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.370" end="00:50:44.860" style="s2">the best possible life and so that&#39;s why</p>

<p begin="00:53:01.000" end="00:53:03.900" style="s2">going to be about</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.940" end="00:53:10.700" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be about Socratic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.060" end="00:53:12.350" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.700" end="00:53:16.760" style="s2">dollar what I&#39;m interested in is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.350" end="00:53:19.910" style="s2">following I&#39;m interested I had an</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.760" end="00:53:21.830" style="s2">amazing conversation I expect everyone</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.910" end="00:53:23.869" style="s2">with Jordan Hall would be which or no</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.830" end="00:53:25.310" style="s2">but he proposed that what he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.869" end="00:53:28.660" style="s2">about is that the need for a meta</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.310" end="00:53:31.850" style="s2">psychic technology by which we Shepherd</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.660" end="00:53:33.590" style="s2">the ecology of practices and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.850" end="00:53:35.240" style="s2">that was a really powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.590" end="00:53:37.190" style="s2">interesting thing to say he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.240" end="00:53:39.890" style="s2">talked about a bit recently with Tim a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.190" end="00:53:41.800" style="s2">dilemma in boys club if you want to take</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.890" end="00:53:46.910" style="s2">a look at a recent video about that</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.800" end="00:53:48.530" style="s2">and it struck me that something that did</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.910" end="00:53:50.600" style="s2">that in the ancient world was platonic</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.530" end="00:53:51.950" style="s2">dialectic now laconic dialectic of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.600" end="00:53:55.100" style="s2">course was a historical thing it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.950" end="00:53:56.270" style="s2">changing but the you give this constant</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.100" end="00:53:58.070" style="s2">reference especially in the neo platonic</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.270" end="00:54:00.290" style="s2">tradition that but even with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.070" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">platonic tradition right of dialectic as</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.290" end="00:54:07.670" style="s2">this practice right that it governs all</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:09.859" style="s2">of the other spiritual exercises and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.670" end="00:54:11.780" style="s2">regulates them in some important way</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.859" end="00:54:14.359" style="s2">Sheppard&#39;s them as I try to say picking</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.780" end="00:54:16.550" style="s2">up on the ecological metaphor if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.359" end="00:54:18.710" style="s2">allow me and so I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.550" end="00:54:20.200" style="s2">trying to understand what that was and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.710" end="00:54:23.480" style="s2">how it worked and there&#39;s just some</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.200" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">great work by Dru Highland and Gonzales</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.480" end="00:54:29.570" style="s2">and I&#39;ll ball wrap a and a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">of other people right who are really</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.570" end="00:54:32.690" style="s2">unpacking what was going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">dialogues and we have to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.690" end="00:54:35.540" style="s2">to the drama in the dialogue because the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:37.369" style="s2">perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.540" end="00:54:39.470" style="s2">and participatory knowing is as</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.369" end="00:54:43.190" style="s2">important as the propositions that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.470" end="00:54:45.500" style="s2">being uttered so all of that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.190" end="00:54:48.440" style="s2">unpack that deeply but then what I want</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.500" end="00:54:51.140" style="s2">to do and and this is intended I want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.440" end="00:54:53.690" style="s2">put that into dialogue with all a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.140" end="00:54:56.150" style="s2">the current practices that people are</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.690" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">engaging in like Dyson starts circling</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.150" end="00:55:01.460" style="s2">and some of the work that Peter Lim Barr</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.400" end="00:55:04.430" style="s2">Limburg it&#39;s doing with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.460" end="00:55:06.350" style="s2">anti debate on authentic relating it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.430" end="00:55:08.180" style="s2">because we have a rich here we can look</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.350" end="00:55:10.070" style="s2">at Socrates and then we can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.180" end="00:55:12.500" style="s2">legacy we can look at the Stoics and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.070" end="00:55:14.990" style="s2">can look at the way dialectic developed</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.500" end="00:55:16.100" style="s2">and changed and then we can put it into</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.990" end="00:55:19.130" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.100" end="00:55:22.130" style="s2">with a lot of these current practices</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.130" end="00:55:27.140" style="s2">and so that we can hopefully in that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.130" end="00:55:29.030" style="s2">dialogue find a way to tap into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.140" end="00:55:31.700" style="s2">collective intelligence of a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.030" end="00:55:36.220" style="s2">cognition so that we can get this meta</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.700" end="00:55:41.390" style="s2">psycho technology that will allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.220" end="00:55:45.500" style="s2">better cultivate and coordinate a an</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.390" end="00:55:47.210" style="s2">ecology of practices and so this this</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.500" end="00:55:52.430" style="s2">series is going to be called after</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.210" end="00:55:55.130" style="s2">Socrates the pursuit of wisdom through</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.430" end="00:55:57.590" style="s2">authentic dialog and so we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.130" end="00:55:59.600" style="s2">be in that series going into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.590" end="00:56:02.900" style="s2">Platonic dialogues at least for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.600" end="00:56:05.480" style="s2">first chunk of the series to get a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.900" end="00:56:07.880" style="s2">deeper understanding of what&#39;s or attic</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.480" end="00:56:10.040" style="s2">and Linkous platonic dialogue mean so</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.880" end="00:56:12.500" style="s2">and then again like trace it out and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.040" end="00:56:15.350" style="s2">some of the legacies that come out of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.500" end="00:56:18.860" style="s2">you know we go the Stoics you know other</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.350" end="00:56:20.990" style="s2">other versions of the dialectic and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.860" end="00:56:24.170" style="s2">put that into dialogue with what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.990" end="00:56:27.560" style="s2">on right now as a way of trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.170" end="00:56:30.170" style="s2">us an enriched vocabulary an increased</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.560" end="00:56:33.740" style="s2">sense of you know preset a repertoire of</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.170" end="00:56:36.680" style="s2">templates so sort of more theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.740" end="00:56:40.760" style="s2">space grammar to move around in as we</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.680" end="00:56:45.170" style="s2">try to come up with sets of you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.760" end="00:56:48.620" style="s2">ways of cultivating ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.170" end="00:56:50.600" style="s2">practices in a collective and manner</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.620" end="00:56:54.820" style="s2">that taps into the power of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.600" end="00:56:58.760" style="s2">cognition so that we can more readily</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.820" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">address the meaning crisis so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.760" end="00:57:02.690" style="s2">great question thank you for asking it</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:06.620" style="s2">it gave me a chance to plug what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.690" end="00:57:08.060" style="s2">coming I&#39;m very excited about this this</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.620" end="00:57:09.350" style="s2">next series it won&#39;t be as long as</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.060" end="00:57:12.550" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.350" end="00:57:16.370" style="s2">probably only be like 20 episodes but</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.550" end="00:57:19.940" style="s2">this this issue about how do we get how</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.370" end="00:57:23.230" style="s2">do we recover dialogue and dialectic how</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.940" end="00:57:26.870" style="s2">do we get at this ability to tap into</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.230" end="00:57:28.660" style="s2">both our right destroy the power of our</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.870" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">distributed cognition and the</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:34.759" style="s2">the of intelligibility is something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.059" end="00:57:37.249" style="s2">is crucial and urgent for us right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.759" end="00:57:40.069" style="s2">and so I want to pick that up in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.249" end="00:57:42.140" style="s2">next series so and I&#39;m already working</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.069" end="00:57:44.420" style="s2">on it I&#39;m doing it and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.140" end="00:57:46.939" style="s2">looking forward to sharing that with you</p>
