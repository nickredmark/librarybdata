<p begin="00:00:01.439" end="00:00:04.830" style="s2">listening as a podcast remember to</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">subscribe and hit the bell to track</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.830" end="00:00:12.769" style="s2">upcoming releases so I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">both joining me here for this and I have</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.769" end="00:00:25.430" style="s2">a sense of how to proceed here and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:28.650" style="s2">first thing I ask we do is that we take</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.430" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">30 seconds of silence together and after</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.650" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">that silence I&#39;m going to open a space</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:44.579" style="s2">as it were I have a sense perhaps of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:50.460" style="s2">what a link one of many between us is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.579" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">and I would presence that and not put</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.460" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">that link or that frame before being</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:00:58.039" style="s2">here now together more as a departure</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">point and we&#39;ll see where we land and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.039" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">then we are then we are off so if that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:09.869" style="s2">sounds good then perhaps we can take 30</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">seconds of silence here I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.869" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">shut my eyes please feel free to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:24.049" style="s2">whatever is most natural yeah I will do</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:24.049" style="s2">the same okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.330" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">oh so it is a real pleasure in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.150" end="00:01:38.230" style="s2">uncertain time to be here with you both</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:42.700" style="s2">over the last four to five months I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.230" end="00:01:45.010" style="s2">had the privilege of speaking with both</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.700" end="00:01:48.670" style="s2">of you separately on a few Kate on a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.010" end="00:01:51.070" style="s2">occasions each now and both of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.670" end="00:01:55.150" style="s2">conversations have been deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.070" end="00:01:57.910" style="s2">meaningful to me and meaningful to many</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.150" end="00:02:04.930" style="s2">I know who have listened and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.910" end="00:02:10.899" style="s2">even transformative for me and my sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.930" end="00:02:13.330" style="s2">is the wisdom inherent in the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.899" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">I have been present to in each of you as</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.330" end="00:02:21.160" style="s2">well as in the theory that each of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:23.890" style="s2">have been developing on and Express is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.160" end="00:02:28.270" style="s2">one that is in an important sense deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.890" end="00:02:30.130" style="s2">resonant and well worth present sing</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.270" end="00:02:33.190" style="s2">together although of course I don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.130" end="00:02:37.300" style="s2">mean the theory so my hope is that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.190" end="00:02:42.120" style="s2">this conversation we come all of get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.300" end="00:02:45.310" style="s2">know each other and generate insight</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.120" end="00:02:47.590" style="s2">informative of you understanding that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.310" end="00:02:50.250" style="s2">beneficial and helpful really up and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.590" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2">down the stack for for for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.250" end="00:02:59.290" style="s2">each other others and not in any way</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:03:04.690" style="s2">disconnected from from mind and heart</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.290" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">and soul and what have you and the sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.690" end="00:03:11.880" style="s2">I have of and here I&#39;ll present</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:15.940" style="s2">something that is as well core to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.880" end="00:03:22.420" style="s2">core insight that is moving me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.940" end="00:03:26.320" style="s2">driving me to express and realize things</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.420" end="00:03:28.330" style="s2">in the world in conformity with or being</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.320" end="00:03:30.100" style="s2">informed by is the following and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.330" end="00:03:36.489" style="s2">we can take that as a departure point</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.100" end="00:03:38.989" style="s2">and that is this dynamic of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.489" end="00:03:42.110" style="s2">relationship between authentic</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.989" end="00:03:45.230" style="s2">expression and how it is met in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.110" end="00:03:46.939" style="s2">relationship in its context and here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.230" end="00:03:49.370" style="s2">going to use words that I know are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.939" end="00:03:51.709" style="s2">resonant with each of you in perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.370" end="00:03:55.939" style="s2">slightly different ways but to that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.709" end="00:03:59.659" style="s2">hopefully bring our vocabulary and sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.939" end="00:04:02.659" style="s2">together the expression of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.659" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">when it is met in an environment of care</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.659" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">and perhaps a few other things although</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to belabor us with too many</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:13.879" style="s2">words when authentic expression is met</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.340" end="00:04:19.669" style="s2">with care we have here a core dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.879" end="00:04:23.720" style="s2">the of the dynamic of growth and when</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.669" end="00:04:28.250" style="s2">authentic expression is truncated</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.720" end="00:04:30.949" style="s2">perhaps traumatized we have here the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.250" end="00:04:33.410" style="s2">opposite we have here the retraction of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.949" end="00:04:36.830" style="s2">the opportunity for growth in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.410" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">extreme and there&#39;s links here with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.830" end="00:04:45.740" style="s2">with notions of voluntary confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:48.530" style="s2">you know of a fear of uncertainty and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.740" end="00:04:51.289" style="s2">have here also notions of the value of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.530" end="00:04:52.310" style="s2">stepping into vulnerability we also</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.289" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">presencing the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.310" end="00:04:57.080" style="s2">relationship and this dynamic between</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:05.750" style="s2">individual and context and self and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.080" end="00:05:07.340" style="s2">other so i from here as a framing I see</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.750" end="00:05:10.580" style="s2">this as being something important to all</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.340" end="00:05:17.180" style="s2">of us and deeply informative of the of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.580" end="00:05:18.910" style="s2">the ideas and ultimately embodied way we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.180" end="00:05:21.010" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.910" end="00:05:26.020" style="s2">realize in our lives and together and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.010" end="00:05:29.980" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in how that lands for</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.020" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">both of you so that&#39;s that&#39;s all I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.980" end="00:05:40.360" style="s2">to say powerful framing I guess I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:43.450" style="s2">say I&#39;d want to pull out two of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.360" end="00:05:45.640" style="s2">central things that were sort of anchor</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.450" end="00:05:47.860" style="s2">points on what you said this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.640" end="00:05:50.910" style="s2">authentic dialogue authentic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.860" end="00:05:55.180" style="s2">and part of what I would like to explore</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.910" end="00:05:57.340" style="s2">is the possibility of opening both of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.180" end="00:05:59.230" style="s2">those back up putting them into question</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.340" end="00:06:03.240" style="s2">and you know in a high to garyun sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.230" end="00:06:06.130" style="s2">what do we mean by authenticity I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.240" end="00:06:09.310" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean Heidegger is perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.130" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">person who made that you know a way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.310" end="00:06:12.760" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:16.750" style="s2">and but I imagine it has drifted quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.760" end="00:06:18.340" style="s2">away from what it could be for us I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.750" end="00:06:19.720" style="s2">like to what I&#39;m saying is I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.340" end="00:06:22.870" style="s2">open these both up in a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.720" end="00:06:24.250" style="s2">questioning what do we mean what are we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.870" end="00:06:30.070" style="s2">trying to get at when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.250" end="00:06:33.310" style="s2">get out of often disappear to dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.070" end="00:06:35.500" style="s2">or what I&#39;d like to call deal logos and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.310" end="00:06:38.650" style="s2">how do those two opening up how do they</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.500" end="00:06:40.690" style="s2">relate to each other because I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.650" end="00:06:43.750" style="s2">you&#39;re right there&#39;s a there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.690" end="00:06:48.120" style="s2">are at least the people I&#39;m coming into</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.750" end="00:06:52.300" style="s2">communication with people are hungry for</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.120" end="00:06:55.240" style="s2">a kind of connectedness that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.300" end="00:06:58.810" style="s2">simultaneously grounds them and affords</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.240" end="00:07:02.130" style="s2">them also growth and transformation they</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.810" end="00:07:06.070" style="s2">have a there&#39;s a hunger for this but</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.130" end="00:07:07.750" style="s2">they feel that a lot of the ways the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.070" end="00:07:10.210" style="s2">terms and the concepts they bring to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.750" end="00:07:13.330" style="s2">bear to try and express it are not</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.210" end="00:07:16.140" style="s2">translating into transformative practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:18.940" style="s2">and so there seems to me to be a gap</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.140" end="00:07:24.130" style="s2">between the conceptual framework we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.940" end="00:07:27.580" style="s2">using to try and express this and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.130" end="00:07:29.710" style="s2">ability to achieve the goals that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.580" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">pursuing in the expression so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.710" end="00:07:31.639" style="s2">kind of what I&#39;m interested in in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:38.930" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.639" end="00:07:49.449" style="s2">I guess what comes up for me right away</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.930" end="00:07:52.669" style="s2">around that is this the paradoxes of of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.449" end="00:07:55.310" style="s2">where actually is the self so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.669" end="00:07:56.810" style="s2">assuming that there&#39;s if we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.310" end="00:07:58.789" style="s2">starting with this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.810" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">authenticity that we would be tapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.789" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">into something that was something</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:12.370" style="s2">sincerely within me that I could share</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:15.889" style="s2">with you and the paradox there is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.370" end="00:08:20.150" style="s2">that I know of course I would offer you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.889" end="00:08:28.759" style="s2">everything I would gladly unzip myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.150" end="00:08:32.750" style="s2">and be there but I have this this kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.759" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">of interesting tension of recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.750" end="00:08:39.949" style="s2">that if I did what you would see is all</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:42.380" style="s2">the ways in which the context that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.949" end="00:08:46.699" style="s2">have lived with in the experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.380" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">I have had the the you know the traumas</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.699" end="00:08:55.610" style="s2">from school and being wrong and the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:09:00.370" style="s2">way in which you know maybe right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.610" end="00:09:05.990" style="s2">our speech patterns are getting judged</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.370" end="00:09:10.339" style="s2">that those would be indications and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.990" end="00:09:13.820" style="s2">would be they would be an illustration</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.339" end="00:09:15.800" style="s2">of all the ways in which that thing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.820" end="00:09:18.440" style="s2">I would wish to unzip and show you that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.800" end="00:09:20.990" style="s2">would be truly mine is actually of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.450" end="00:11:34.970" style="s2">shows you how pervasive almost parasitic</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.090" end="00:11:56.070" style="s2">should also just step back and pause on</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:57.770" style="s2">right away and say notice how this how</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.070" end="00:12:01.410" style="s2">the very thing was supposed to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.770" end="00:12:04.020" style="s2">all of this got reabsorbed into the very</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.020" end="00:12:09.840" style="s2">think that&#39;s that should give us some</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.780" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">pause for how carefully we need to work</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.840" end="00:12:13.830" style="s2">together on this right now because</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:15.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot happening in our cultural</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.570" end="00:12:24.090" style="s2">drive us towards a closure the very</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.090" end="00:12:27.420" style="s2">question but I hope I understood you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.010" end="00:12:28.890" style="s2">Nora because that&#39;s what that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.420" end="00:12:31.620" style="s2">connection I&#39;m getting from what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.890" end="00:12:35.390" style="s2">said that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly where I want</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.620" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">to go and I mean even language and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.390" end="00:12:43.680" style="s2">certainly communication patterns become</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:46.590" style="s2">a kind of reflection of repetition of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.680" end="00:12:49.260" style="s2">extension of these various contextual</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.590" end="00:12:51.690" style="s2">threads that say this is who I am this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.260" end="00:12:57.620" style="s2">is and when I want to say yeah but this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.690" end="00:13:00.750" style="s2">is the real me where&#39;s the real me and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.620" end="00:13:04.430" style="s2">think that that there have been moments</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.750" end="00:13:07.550" style="s2">and I think those moments of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.430" end="00:13:12.330" style="s2">might be something really to look into</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.550" end="00:13:16.440" style="s2">and that those moments where I prior to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.330" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">the past couple of weeks my most</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.440" end="00:13:23.180" style="s2">frequent experience of moments of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:26.180" style="s2">confusion that maybe had something of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:26.180" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.690" end="00:13:34.470" style="s2">what do I even want to call it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.430" end="00:13:38.940" style="s2">something raw okay I&#39;ll just say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.470" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">something wrong so it is when I live in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.940" end="00:13:48.810" style="s2">in Sweden and I live in I do a lot of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:50.310" style="s2">lot of my life in multiple cultures so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.810" end="00:13:54.390" style="s2">mean Rana which is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.310" end="00:13:57.540" style="s2">multicultural place very multicultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.390" end="00:13:59.940" style="s2">place please go ahead yeah so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.540" end="00:14:02.010" style="s2">things that can happen is that you I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.940" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">have found that I could think that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.010" end="00:14:07.890" style="s2">have expressed something and and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:11.750" style="s2">realised that that is not what was</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.890" end="00:14:14.640" style="s2">received and get very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.750" end="00:14:16.610" style="s2">disoriented in the reception in the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.640" end="00:14:19.800" style="s2">the reception is reflected back to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.610" end="00:14:26.310" style="s2">and and there&#39;s a something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.800" end="00:14:30.210" style="s2">there that is is like a crack in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.310" end="00:14:33.090" style="s2">matrix of my various contextual</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.210" end="00:14:40.620" style="s2">formations and language and and those</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.090" end="00:14:44.310" style="s2">cracks those cracks might be the closest</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.620" end="00:14:47.070" style="s2">I know to to getting at this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.310" end="00:14:50.790" style="s2">and and right now I think there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.070" end="00:14:55.080" style="s2">awful lot of cracks of looking around</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.790" end="00:14:58.110" style="s2">and thinking you know really who who are</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.080" end="00:15:00.930" style="s2">we what what do I say what what can we</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.110" end="00:15:04.290" style="s2">possibly say in this moment being is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.930" end="00:15:07.860" style="s2">authentic and the second I try to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.290" end="00:15:12.750" style="s2">it authentic it becomes in effect ik for</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.860" end="00:15:16.290" style="s2">sure yeah I just I understand that was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.750" end="00:15:18.450" style="s2">good point you made about how you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.290" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">that pattern that I was pointing to sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.450" end="00:15:23.780" style="s2">of historically with Heidegger is also</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:28.890" style="s2">something we find prevalent in our own</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.780" end="00:15:30.630" style="s2">attempts I was what called to mind was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.890" end="00:15:33.030" style="s2">Leonard Cohen song and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.630" end="00:15:37.140" style="s2">you know the crack that lets you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.030" end="00:15:40.670" style="s2">that lets the light right yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.140" end="00:15:40.670" style="s2">this leads me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.700" end="00:15:48.300" style="s2">this leads me to well somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.900" end="00:15:52.260" style="s2">practiced introducing those cracks as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.300" end="00:15:53.640" style="s2">way of trying to provoke wonder and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.260" end="00:15:55.770" style="s2">like to at some point talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.640" end="00:15:57.570" style="s2">difference between wonder which calls</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.770" end="00:16:00.420" style="s2">this self and the world into question</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.570" end="00:16:04.110" style="s2">and curiosity which tries to feed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.420" end="00:16:08.340" style="s2">plug up the gaps in the self and and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.110" end="00:16:11.490" style="s2">worldview and so but I&#39;m so and and had</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.340" end="00:16:13.260" style="s2">a lot to say about a dialogical notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.490" end="00:16:15.150" style="s2">of the self and I&#39;m thinking here of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.260" end="00:16:16.980" style="s2">figure of Socrates that I&#39;m and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.150" end="00:16:22.290" style="s2">I&#39;m working to try and understand very</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.980" end="00:16:24.750" style="s2">deeply precisely because he had a form</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.290" end="00:16:28.080" style="s2">of communicative practice that centered</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.750" end="00:16:31.350" style="s2">upon introducing those cracks getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.080" end="00:16:33.480" style="s2">people to a place of aporia where it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.350" end="00:16:35.460" style="s2">possible it was not inevitable not</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.480" end="00:16:37.530" style="s2">inevitable but it was possible for them</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.460" end="00:16:39.150" style="s2">to come to a state of wonder that</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.530" end="00:16:41.850" style="s2">opening where they could call the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.150" end="00:16:46.670" style="s2">the self and the world into question and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.850" end="00:16:48.780" style="s2">then they and that could induce them to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.670" end="00:16:51.270" style="s2">see the self as something that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.780" end="00:16:53.370" style="s2">aspired to as opposed to something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.270" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">has already possessed and so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.370" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">interested in all of that and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:04.890" style="s2">question and the work I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:07.830" style="s2">with Peter Lindbergh and guys tense talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.890" end="00:17:10.260" style="s2">and Chris master Pietro is is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.830" end="00:17:11.310" style="s2">possible for us I&#39;m changing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.260" end="00:17:13.140" style="s2">question slightly nor don&#39;t I hope</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.310" end="00:17:17.790" style="s2">you&#39;ll be patient with me is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.140" end="00:17:23.460" style="s2">for us to learn from that such that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.790" end="00:17:24.870" style="s2">could be better able to pursue what</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.460" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to pursue right now which</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.870" end="00:17:34.380" style="s2">is getting some sense of how to move</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:36.510" style="s2">towards deeper communication deeper</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.010" end="00:17:45.090" style="s2">to think about this right now I&#39;m trying</p>

<p begin="00:17:45.090" end="00:17:52.230" style="s2">have managed in past to give us examples</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.320" end="00:17:54.520" style="s2">and to be exemplars of how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.230" end="00:17:57.010" style="s2">thing we&#39;re doing and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.520" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">it mean for us to learn from them well</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.010" end="00:18:01.870" style="s2">first of all can we learn from them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.790" style="s2">then what does it mean for us to learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.870" end="00:18:06.930" style="s2">from them and how do we bring that about</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:23.110" style="s2">interactions and that&#39;s the level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.710" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">madness by which I&#39;m approaching this</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.110" end="00:19:27.070" style="s2">environment but as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:34.930" style="s2">it may be possible at least you know I</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.500" end="00:19:57.970" style="s2">for somebody who regularly like I said</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.039" end="00:20:15.539" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s wonder as just</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.399" end="00:20:17.009" style="s2">and I follow fuller and other people and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.539" end="00:20:21.899" style="s2">seeing wonder is very different from</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.009" end="00:20:25.649" style="s2">mere mere curiosity and that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.899" end="00:20:27.690" style="s2">induce wonder and to put the bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.649" end="00:20:31.080" style="s2">people to a place it wasn&#39;t inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.690" end="00:20:35.509" style="s2">but it was possible where they could</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.080" end="00:20:41.239" style="s2">aspire to a different self and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.509" end="00:20:44.609" style="s2">different world is is I think a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.239" end="00:20:46.470" style="s2">example for us to consider precisely</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.609" end="00:20:48.509" style="s2">because the the Socratic model of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.470" end="00:20:50.369" style="s2">authenticity is an aspirational model</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.509" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">their true self is not something you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.369" end="00:20:54.869" style="s2">possess and it&#39;s not something you</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:56.820" style="s2">possess in distinction from others or</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.869" end="00:20:59.009" style="s2">your world it&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.820" end="00:21:01.739" style="s2">aspire to continually and never in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.009" end="00:21:04.679" style="s2">kind of completion to an ongoing process</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.739" end="00:21:07.139" style="s2">of mutual transformation and although</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.679" end="00:21:09.299" style="s2">I&#39;m not claiming we can get back that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.139" end="00:21:12.210" style="s2">would be an Akron Akande and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.299" end="00:21:13.950" style="s2">fallacious to Socrates or the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.210" end="00:21:15.929" style="s2">world although there are some very</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.950" end="00:21:17.429" style="s2">important similarities Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.929" end="00:21:19.769" style="s2">carrying out his practice while Athens</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.429" end="00:21:21.090" style="s2">is literally under siege the whole city</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.769" end="00:21:23.669" style="s2">is quarantined and there had been a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.090" end="00:21:25.109" style="s2">plague so his context is not that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.669" end="00:21:29.099" style="s2">different from ours in some important</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.109" end="00:21:32.190" style="s2">ways I&#39;m recommending that we that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.099" end="00:21:36.139" style="s2">take a look at Socratic dialogue as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.190" end="00:21:40.619" style="s2">way of perhaps speeding up the process</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.139" end="00:21:44.190" style="s2">by which we can learn about how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.619" end="00:21:47.279" style="s2">recover a relational sentence of self</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.190" end="00:21:51.149" style="s2">and an operational sense of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.279" end="00:21:53.099" style="s2">perhaps that are urgently needed right</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.149" end="00:21:55.580" style="s2">now and then that&#39;s on and I propose</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.099" end="00:22:00.029" style="s2">that to Nora and then she added</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.580" end="00:22:02.909" style="s2">something to say about it um yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.029" end="00:22:06.840" style="s2">really love that you&#39;re taking it to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.909" end="00:22:11.309" style="s2">this place John because this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.840" end="00:22:14.639" style="s2">where I&#39;m working with all my hours and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.309" end="00:22:20.039" style="s2">moments and days and heart and soul</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.639" end="00:22:22.549" style="s2">right now and I have been generating</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.039" end="00:22:22.549" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.980" end="00:22:30.090" style="s2">okay let&#39;s call them dialogues but</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:32.940" style="s2">there&#39;s they&#39;re sort of I called them</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.090" end="00:22:38.700" style="s2">warm data labs okay so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.940" end="00:22:42.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an exploration of a complex</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.700" end="00:22:46.860" style="s2">question with a number of people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.440" end="00:22:50.280" style="s2">that exploration includes them starting</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.860" end="00:22:53.070" style="s2">in small groups around various contexts</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.280" end="00:22:54.660" style="s2">and then they move when they want to but</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.070" end="00:22:55.950" style="s2">if I don&#39;t ring a bell and make a move</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.660" end="00:22:58.470" style="s2">they go where they want when they want</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.950" end="00:23:00.090" style="s2">and things get mixed up this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.470" end="00:23:06.230" style="s2">back in the days when people could be in</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.090" end="00:23:09.270" style="s2">the same room together so what I started</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.230" end="00:23:14.790" style="s2">to witness happening with that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:17.490" style="s2">really interesting because as people to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.790" end="00:23:21.030" style="s2">explore to question whether that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.490" end="00:23:25.410" style="s2">question is something like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.030" end="00:23:29.130" style="s2">is health or what is identity or what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.410" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">authenticity could even be one look that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.130" end="00:23:38.130" style="s2">that becomes something that is very</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:41.880" style="s2">swiftly revealed in the stories and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.130" end="00:23:43.980" style="s2">inputs between the people as being</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.880" end="00:23:46.020" style="s2">something that exists between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.980" end="00:23:49.410" style="s2">contexts and between the people so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.020" end="00:23:53.970" style="s2">started a liminal revealer and an</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.410" end="00:23:57.480" style="s2">interdependency revealer and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.970" end="00:24:00.270" style="s2">I guess where I&#39;m going with that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.480" end="00:24:02.580" style="s2">that the the more of those processes</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.270" end="00:24:04.470" style="s2">that I have done and I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.580" end="00:24:09.630" style="s2">hundreds of them around the world the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.470" end="00:24:15.630" style="s2">more I I&#39;m seeing how important it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.630" end="00:24:21.660" style="s2">that that process of opening those</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.630" end="00:24:26.910" style="s2">cracks of coming into that that wonder</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.660" end="00:24:30.360" style="s2">is actually it&#39;s not to be done alone no</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.910" end="00:24:33.630" style="s2">we actually need each other to provide</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.360" end="00:24:35.549" style="s2">multiple description and by that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.630" end="00:24:38.669" style="s2">just mean lots of perspectives I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.549" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">so mean lots of textures of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.669" end="00:24:44.269" style="s2">talking so it&#39;s not just my professional</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:47.220" style="s2">knowledge or or just my personal stories</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.269" end="00:24:50.399" style="s2">right you have to have both of those and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.220" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">questions and jokes and things that come</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.399" end="00:24:59.999" style="s2">up between people that are unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:25:03.720" style="s2">and that in a strange way in the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.999" end="00:25:10.220" style="s2">most intimate kind of shiftings happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.720" end="00:25:12.600" style="s2">in this possibility of having multiple</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.220" end="00:25:16.470" style="s2">patterning &#39;he&#39;s kind of overlay like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.600" end="00:25:19.889" style="s2">more a phenomenon mm-hmm so that in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.470" end="00:25:21.779" style="s2">more a phenomenon there becomes I guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.889" end="00:25:23.340" style="s2">one of the signatures of them soiree is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.779" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">that you have one pattern and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.340" end="00:25:28.440" style="s2">have another pattern and when you cross</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:30.989" style="s2">them you have a third pattern and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.440" end="00:25:32.669" style="s2">third pattern can actually tell you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.989" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">something about either of the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.669" end="00:25:40.710" style="s2">patterns but it isn&#39;t right and so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:45.809" style="s2">I&#39;m getting at is that a kind of insight</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.710" end="00:25:51.269" style="s2">can come out of that overlay and and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.809" end="00:25:54.989" style="s2">this is where where those insights are</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.269" end="00:25:57.749" style="s2">not actually accessible very often in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.989" end="00:26:01.470" style="s2">life and in this moment I&#39;m with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.749" end="00:26:04.019" style="s2">there&#39;s an urgency so this process that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.470" end="00:26:08.549" style="s2">I&#39;ve been playing with is actually kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.019" end="00:26:12.330" style="s2">of an accelerated an accelerated inter</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.549" end="00:26:15.720" style="s2">dependency insight maker that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.330" end="00:26:18.809" style="s2">that&#39;s amazing that&#39;s really cool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.720" end="00:26:22.289" style="s2">really cool yeah I&#39;m very excited about</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.809" end="00:26:26.609" style="s2">this so if we could unpack this just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.289" end="00:26:28.609" style="s2">little the practice I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.609" end="00:26:30.509" style="s2">much you know of my work that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.609" end="00:26:32.190" style="s2">engaging in a lot of participant</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.509" end="00:26:34.230" style="s2">observation and a lot of these emerging</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.190" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">I call them cyclic technologies or these</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.230" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">practices of trying to afford insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:45.889" style="s2">and flow within you know within dialog</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:49.170" style="s2">within you know distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.889" end="00:26:52.020" style="s2">and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.170" end="00:26:52.650" style="s2">you know and also people trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.020" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">things together</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.650" end="00:26:56.220" style="s2">it&#39;s what I&#39;m saying is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:26:57.780" style="s2">interesting conversion so for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.220" end="00:26:58.770" style="s2">I&#39;ve been participating in circling and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.780" end="00:27:01.290" style="s2">then they&#39;re they&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.770" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">circling to integrate with you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.290" end="00:27:05.790" style="s2">bringing in important topical questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:08.130" style="s2">so how do we go from just circling where</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.790" end="00:27:10.740" style="s2">we&#39;re maintaining the circle to making</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.130" end="00:27:12.390" style="s2">it topical in a fashion and and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.740" end="00:27:13.800" style="s2">what are the bridging processes you do</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.390" end="00:27:16.530" style="s2">because if you just sort of slam people</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.800" end="00:27:19.050" style="s2">from circling to a topic they can get</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.530" end="00:27:22.530" style="s2">sort of they can the coherence can break</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.050" end="00:27:25.850" style="s2">and so I&#39;m it&#39;s really interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.530" end="00:27:29.670" style="s2">how a lot of things seem to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.850" end="00:27:30.900" style="s2">you know towards each other so I can I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.670" end="00:27:32.760" style="s2">ask you some more</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.900" end="00:27:35.070" style="s2">I don&#39;t know this isn&#39;t the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.760" end="00:27:36.600" style="s2">adjective so but be forgiving on it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.070" end="00:27:39.150" style="s2">I ask you some more technical questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.600" end="00:27:41.040" style="s2">more specific questions about so sorry</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.150" end="00:27:42.330" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m just gonna be a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.040" end="00:27:43.380" style="s2">bit of a cognitive scientist here for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.330" end="00:27:45.870" style="s2">moment because I&#39;m really really</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.380" end="00:27:49.460" style="s2">intriguing this one thing and and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.870" end="00:27:51.690" style="s2">and this is something that pattern I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.460" end="00:27:53.250" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to take anything away for</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.690" end="00:27:55.410" style="s2">you I&#39;ve thought about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.250" end="00:27:56.910" style="s2">because that&#39;s very similar about you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.410" end="00:27:59.070" style="s2">know this sort of small world network</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.910" end="00:28:01.530" style="s2">formation you get within a brain to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.070" end="00:28:03.060" style="s2">provoke insight within and I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.530" end="00:28:05.640" style="s2">wondering if we could get that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.060" end="00:28:08.580" style="s2">fluid small world network restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.640" end="00:28:09.900" style="s2">between people that would also bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.580" end="00:28:12.240" style="s2">about an insight and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.900" end="00:28:15.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually already cottoned onto</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:16.680" style="s2">this and made it work so that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.000" end="00:28:18.600" style="s2">really fascinating and then I&#39;m what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.680" end="00:28:20.100" style="s2">really interested in well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.600" end="00:28:21.660" style="s2">multiple things use what you said is</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.100" end="00:28:23.550" style="s2">just writing me up right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.660" end="00:28:26.550" style="s2">interested in what&#39;s the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.550" end="00:28:28.380" style="s2">between you know the group insight if</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.550" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">you Lana and the individual insights how</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.380" end="00:28:32.970" style="s2">are they resonating with each other how</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.350" style="s2">is that working and then the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.970" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">talked about with the patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.350" end="00:28:37.710" style="s2">Chris and I talked about that in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:39.780" style="s2">article the chapter we&#39;ve written about</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.710" end="00:28:42.060" style="s2">this sort of third factor that emerges I</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.780" end="00:28:43.860" style="s2">see it encircling all the time in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.060" end="00:28:47.010" style="s2">you get you get so you&#39;ll get people</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.860" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">will get into this like two people than</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.010" end="00:28:50.790" style="s2">these people and then that gets layered</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.950" style="s2">and you get that emergent this what we</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.790" end="00:28:55.740" style="s2">call the third factor I can give it sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.950" end="00:28:59.430" style="s2">of an extensive reference without a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.740" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">just cleared a notation and I&#39;m real and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.430" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is people&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.980" end="00:29:06.030" style="s2">I want to ask you if this is also the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:08.490" style="s2">huh like do people sense that like do</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.030" end="00:29:11.540" style="s2">they get a sense of something telling</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.490" end="00:29:14.250" style="s2">them or calling them to move from one</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.540" end="00:29:16.500" style="s2">one of the groups to another and do they</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.250" end="00:29:19.110" style="s2">get a sense of you know that something</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.500" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">is taking shape like a light that has a</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.110" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">sort of a systemic life of its own above</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:26.130" style="s2">and beyond not only the individuals but</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:29.340" style="s2">the subgroups because I&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.130" end="00:29:31.410" style="s2">finding that you know reported</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.340" end="00:29:32.820" style="s2">continuously when I&#39;m doing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.410" end="00:29:35.130" style="s2">participant observation of these other</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.820" end="00:29:37.820" style="s2">kinds of practices is that is that also</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.130" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">going on in the one day - laughs</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.820" end="00:29:44.280" style="s2">absolutely and and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:46.440" style="s2">that happens is that it it I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.280" end="00:29:49.020" style="s2">did a lot of systems teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.440" end="00:29:53.429" style="s2">complexity teaching and it was frankly</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.020" end="00:29:55.320" style="s2">irritating because you know people would</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.429" end="00:29:57.450" style="s2">come and we&#39;d have these great workshops</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.320" end="00:29:59.040" style="s2">and people who understood it before felt</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.450" end="00:30:02.429" style="s2">very clever and the people who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.040" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">understand it maybe had a little sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.429" end="00:30:05.850" style="s2">of it for a little while but then it</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">would kind of fade away it would either</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.850" end="00:30:14.850" style="s2">away from them and here&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:18.650" style="s2">finding is that they&#39;re the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.850" end="00:30:23.280" style="s2">structure of the process has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.650" end="00:30:25.650" style="s2">creating the opportunities for about so</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.280" end="00:30:27.870" style="s2">the people can have a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.650" end="00:30:29.790" style="s2">the question of what is health through</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.870" end="00:30:32.220" style="s2">the context of economy and then they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.790" end="00:30:34.020" style="s2">move over to family and and in those</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.220" end="00:30:35.580" style="s2">little circles they tell all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.020" end="00:30:39.210" style="s2">stories and all kinds of stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.580" end="00:30:41.700" style="s2">there&#39;s absolutely no conscious purpose</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.210" end="00:30:44.750" style="s2">control over what gets talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.700" end="00:30:47.730" style="s2">there&#39;s no documentation very important</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.750" end="00:30:49.350" style="s2">no documentation what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.730" end="00:30:51.059" style="s2">specifically by that it&#39;s not recorded</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.350" end="00:30:53.040" style="s2">or people aren&#39;t allowed to cite staff</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.059" end="00:30:56.190" style="s2">or what does that mean I usually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.040" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">do either okay okay there&#39;s no post-its</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.190" end="00:31:00.260" style="s2">there&#39;s no paper tablecloths there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:05.520" style="s2">nobody writing anything down because</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.260" end="00:31:07.620" style="s2">those contextual interactions the story</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.520" end="00:31:11.870" style="s2">that you tell me about your grandmother</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.620" end="00:31:15.190" style="s2">whose recipe reminds me of something and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.870" end="00:31:18.380" style="s2">that is a link like compo</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.190" end="00:31:23.540" style="s2">finding links finding relational process</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.380" end="00:31:25.340" style="s2">right and so that that is and then I go</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.540" end="00:31:27.530" style="s2">to another context and someone says</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.340" end="00:31:29.450" style="s2">something and it connects then to your</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.530" end="00:31:33.190" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s story and the memory that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.450" end="00:31:36.470" style="s2">that brought me to and so that this</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.190" end="00:31:38.270" style="s2">understanding of if you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.470" end="00:31:39.830" style="s2">systemic soar complexity or inter</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.270" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">dependency whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.830" end="00:31:46.970" style="s2">that it turns out to be very intimate so</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:48.950" style="s2">is the idea that there there there</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.970" end="00:31:51.230" style="s2">exemplifying it now right there</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.950" end="00:31:53.030" style="s2">instantiated there participating in it</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.230" end="00:31:54.010" style="s2">they&#39;re not just sort of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.030" end="00:31:57.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.010" end="00:32:01.370" style="s2">yeah well what&#39;s happening is there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.320" end="00:32:02.090" style="s2">about and there&#39;s a within ah right</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.370" end="00:32:05.770" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.090" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">so the the conditions of the lab are</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.770" end="00:32:13.430" style="s2">structured to offer the space for people</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:17.300" style="s2">to talk about right but in the negative</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.430" end="00:32:19.610" style="s2">space of it there&#39;s the liminal of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.300" end="00:32:22.990" style="s2">what&#39;s actually connecting in the within</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.610" end="00:32:25.610" style="s2">so you never have a warm data lab on</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.990" end="00:32:28.100" style="s2">relationships or communication because</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.610" end="00:32:30.560" style="s2">that would be ridiculous those are all</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.100" end="00:32:35.000" style="s2">things that are forming in the within</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.560" end="00:32:38.930" style="s2">yeah right so so that&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.000" end="00:32:41.810" style="s2">interesting and then after the lab</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.930" end="00:32:44.450" style="s2">there&#39;s this moment that I would call</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.810" end="00:32:48.050" style="s2">the mutual learning moment so then</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.450" end="00:32:51.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of a moment when we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.050" end="00:32:52.520" style="s2">the room in plenary and say so you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.260" end="00:32:55.340" style="s2">what did you notice what have you</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.520" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">observed and that&#39;s when you get that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.340" end="00:33:04.130" style="s2">group lift but most don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.940" end="00:33:06.500" style="s2">words for what they&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.130" end="00:33:08.390" style="s2">because it&#39;s been such a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.500" end="00:33:11.900" style="s2">intellectual and physical and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.390" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">and memory and all these things have</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.900" end="00:33:16.280" style="s2">been kind of mushing and reconnecting</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:18.980" style="s2">and they&#39;re in a territory they&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.280" end="00:33:21.830" style="s2">actually had to make words for before</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.980" end="00:33:25.370" style="s2">hmm but a couple of people in the room</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.830" end="00:33:27.110" style="s2">will find the words and when they start</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.370" end="00:33:28.509" style="s2">to find the words the other people also</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.110" end="00:33:31.850" style="s2">find words</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.509" end="00:33:34.940" style="s2">and the words are usually something</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.850" end="00:33:37.249" style="s2">along the lines of I started to notice</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.940" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">that I you know there was repeated</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.249" end="00:33:42.139" style="s2">things in multiple contexts that there</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:44.809" style="s2">was overlap that when I left one context</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.139" end="00:33:47.869" style="s2">the conversation that I had there didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.809" end="00:33:50.149" style="s2">go out of my body I took it with me it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.869" end="00:33:55.850" style="s2">was ease into the next conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.149" end="00:33:58.389" style="s2">so you get this lift that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.850" end="00:34:01.249" style="s2">that moment where the whole room</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.389" end="00:34:04.970" style="s2">realizes that they&#39;ve had very different</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.249" end="00:34:06.970" style="s2">experiences but they&#39;ve had a they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.970" end="00:34:10.250" style="s2">had a mutual learning at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.970" end="00:34:11.990" style="s2">so this idea that mutual learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.250" end="00:34:14.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re learning the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.990" end="00:34:18.919" style="s2">thing look it means we&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.599" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">together and that that is as unique for</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.919" end="00:34:24.290" style="s2">you or me or you know anybody of any age</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:26.389" style="s2">and and really I&#39;ve been working with</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.290" end="00:34:28.760" style="s2">this in very vulnerable communities and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.389" end="00:34:33.379" style="s2">also in Parliament&#39;s so in inner-city</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.760" end="00:34:40.179" style="s2">Pittsburgh with groups of Islamic women</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.379" end="00:34:46.629" style="s2">in Asia in really broken towns in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.179" end="00:34:49.339" style="s2">and then with the Finnish politicians or</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.629" end="00:34:53.000" style="s2">with very so it&#39;s really it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.339" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">anyone can do it kids can do it for sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.000" end="00:35:02.780" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s pretty interesting so have you</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">has this been written down anywhere or</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.780" end="00:35:07.819" style="s2">have you liked because I&#39;d like to learn</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:09.950" style="s2">more about it and we have limited time</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.819" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">here maybe you and I could I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.950" end="00:35:22.549" style="s2">does one learn to practice it because</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">come on take our now so it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.549" end="00:35:27.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of theory there and so to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:32.089" style="s2">bring this kind of back to where we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.770" end="00:35:35.480" style="s2">with this conversation I think probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.089" end="00:35:36.829" style="s2">one of the most important pieces is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.480" end="00:35:40.210" style="s2">piece around</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.829" end="00:35:43.839" style="s2">abductive process and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.210" end="00:35:47.050" style="s2">and that that is the piece where it</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.839" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">starts to become clear in this question</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.050" end="00:35:56.589" style="s2">of of authenticity that there is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:36:00.220" style="s2">of cross contextual description that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.589" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">live within everyone lives within it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.220" end="00:36:05.830" style="s2">fact I would say probably every living</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:07.720" style="s2">thing lives within a cross contextual</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.830" end="00:36:11.260" style="s2">description so if you look at an</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.720" end="00:36:14.680" style="s2">earthworm that earthworm is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.260" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">description in a way of the soil it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.680" end="00:36:20.440" style="s2">also a description of the tree or of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:23.410" style="s2">bird or of the grandpa and grandson that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.440" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">are going to go fishing or right so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.410" end="00:36:29.950" style="s2">earthworm is is just like you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:31.810" style="s2">a description of our education system</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:36.990" style="s2">we&#39;re a description of our culture we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.810" end="00:36:40.990" style="s2">and in these different contexts are</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.990" end="00:36:44.380" style="s2">difficult to grab hold of and fix</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.990" end="00:36:46.420" style="s2">in isolation are in reductionism because</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.380" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">they&#39;re actually not where they you grab</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.420" end="00:36:50.830" style="s2">them and they&#39;re not there you want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.210" end="00:36:54.820" style="s2">fix the education system but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.830" end="00:36:57.640" style="s2">actually it&#39;s actually creative in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.820" end="00:36:59.730" style="s2">abductive process of our economy and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.640" end="00:37:02.650" style="s2">culture and intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.730" end="00:37:07.180" style="s2">expectations and identity and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.650" end="00:37:09.690" style="s2">all these things that then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.180" end="00:37:14.200" style="s2">education system is a consequence right</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.690" end="00:37:18.910" style="s2">right because I see here John if I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.200" end="00:37:21.609" style="s2">just to know we are track do it no no no</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.910" end="00:37:23.260" style="s2">no no no no no not at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.609" end="00:37:26.580" style="s2">just to draw some things together and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.260" end="00:37:32.890" style="s2">make sure that I&#39;m up and with this and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.580" end="00:37:35.830" style="s2">also perhaps is to add a little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.890" end="00:37:39.010" style="s2">if I can synthesize sort of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.830" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">themes we&#39;ve we&#39;ve touched on so far and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.010" end="00:37:46.599" style="s2">importantly authenticity is not the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:49.210" style="s2">expression or the capturing of something</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.599" end="00:37:51.400" style="s2">that is the inherent and importantly</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.210" end="00:37:55.000" style="s2">fixed to you but something that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.400" end="00:37:57.400" style="s2">realized in a some form of cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.000" end="00:38:00.339" style="s2">but ultimately interdependent dynamic on</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.400" end="00:38:02.680" style="s2">an ongoing basis with each other so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.339" end="00:38:04.930" style="s2">are we are present seeing from a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.680" end="00:38:07.330" style="s2">phenomenological perspective that we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.930" end="00:38:10.680" style="s2">talking more than that a question might</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.330" end="00:38:13.780" style="s2">be what is it to show up to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.680" end="00:38:17.400" style="s2">transformation to learning to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.780" end="00:38:19.930" style="s2">drawing forth and and remembering of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.400" end="00:38:21.700" style="s2">engaging in a remembering of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.930" end="00:38:25.480" style="s2">to be with each other and also an</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.700" end="00:38:32.109" style="s2">aspiration of our becoming and deepening</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.480" end="00:38:35.619" style="s2">together too so what we can perhaps add</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.109" end="00:38:37.660" style="s2">in although not to jump the gun is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.619" end="00:38:39.310" style="s2">are some of these modes of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.660" end="00:38:42.369" style="s2">and this is something I&#39;ve thought a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.310" end="00:38:47.109" style="s2">about what are ways we show up actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.369" end="00:38:47.890" style="s2">to these moments of when the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.109" end="00:38:50.589" style="s2">upon us</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.890" end="00:38:53.050" style="s2">John you like to use this term Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.589" end="00:38:54.460" style="s2">that there is a significant imminence to</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.050" end="00:38:56.589" style="s2">the now where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.460" end="00:38:59.500" style="s2">maybe particularly challenged or call up</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.589" end="00:39:01.330" style="s2">called upon to presents ourselves in an</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.500" end="00:39:04.300" style="s2">appropriate or right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.330" end="00:39:07.720" style="s2">each other given the given a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.300" end="00:39:10.180" style="s2">particular energetic context thrust upon</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.720" end="00:39:14.830" style="s2">us and it seems to me we if we really</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.180" end="00:39:16.510" style="s2">were to not be reductive but but attempt</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.830" end="00:39:20.310" style="s2">to synthesize some core modes we might</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.510" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">take in response to this we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.310" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">allow ourselves to be moved by this</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">process in a way that&#39;s appropriate and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:34.119" style="s2">we can allow ourselves as well to more</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:35.880" style="s2">confront and move this process too so</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.119" end="00:39:39.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of a push and pull</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.880" end="00:39:41.830" style="s2">dynamic that can be done effectively or</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.160" end="00:39:44.410" style="s2">less effectively and a lot of that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.830" end="00:39:47.790" style="s2">think has to do with how well we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.410" end="00:39:51.700" style="s2">able to sense what is the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.790" end="00:39:53.890" style="s2">ripening vulnerability to step into with</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.700" end="00:39:59.380" style="s2">a certain kind of care and courage</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.890" end="00:40:02.260" style="s2">rather than to rather than to either</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.380" end="00:40:05.650" style="s2">bury our heads when faced with a moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.260" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">or in fact to attempt to close that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.650" end="00:40:11.349" style="s2">opening before in fact we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">find and be with each other in order to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.349" end="00:40:18.310" style="s2">then come to some kind of harmony or</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:20.260" style="s2">movement together so and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.310" end="00:40:22.089" style="s2">can help ground us as well back in what</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.260" end="00:40:24.250" style="s2">some of the experiences are we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.089" end="00:40:25.950" style="s2">in our lives at the moments because fear</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.250" end="00:40:30.040" style="s2">of course is very much heightened and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.950" end="00:40:32.470" style="s2">care and courage are very much called</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.040" end="00:40:34.359" style="s2">for in this time and it is my hope in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.470" end="00:40:36.070" style="s2">deeper sense that the kind of theory we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.359" end="00:40:39.220" style="s2">might be discussing in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.070" end="00:40:41.980" style="s2">is in actual fact a crucial piece at</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.220" end="00:40:44.260" style="s2">more than a crucial piece that all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.980" end="00:40:46.089" style="s2">this together is very much involved in</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.260" end="00:40:48.430" style="s2">the movement towards the realization of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.089" end="00:40:50.530" style="s2">we because that is also what we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.430" end="00:40:52.599" style="s2">discussing here how can we create these</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.530" end="00:40:55.240" style="s2">mutual learning environments where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.599" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">can give and receive to our fullest as</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.240" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">best we can informative and enabling of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">transformation both individually and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:05.140" style="s2">collectively in touch with ecology so</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:07.030" style="s2">grounding this back in our moment today</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.140" end="00:41:08.290" style="s2">I think is important because the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.030" end="00:41:09.790" style="s2">emotionality people</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.700" end="00:41:42.550" style="s2">discussing here so to add some of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.310" end="00:41:44.680" style="s2">pieces in am I sort of on track with</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.550" end="00:41:50.710" style="s2">some of the core features of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.680" end="00:41:52.570" style="s2">discussion I think so I I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.710" end="00:41:54.280" style="s2">two things I guess I&#39;d want to say first</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.570" end="00:41:58.120" style="s2">to respond to you and then to thread</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.280" end="00:41:59.800" style="s2">back to to Norah I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.120" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">talking about here in the thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.800" end="00:42:04.840" style="s2">mean there is like yeah I see this as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.310" end="00:42:06.340" style="s2">feature of many of these emerging</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.840" end="00:42:08.890" style="s2">practices there&#39;s this oscillation</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.340" end="00:42:10.450" style="s2">between theory and theory aware I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.890" end="00:42:11.860" style="s2">using theory in the old sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.450" end="00:42:13.840" style="s2">word you know the contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.860" end="00:42:15.100" style="s2">immersive involvement that you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.840" end="00:42:17.700" style="s2">gives you insight and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.100" end="00:42:21.820" style="s2">reflective theory that that movement is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.700" end="00:42:26.080" style="s2">and trying to figure out what some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.820" end="00:42:30.280" style="s2">those patterns are not just for theories</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.080" end="00:42:31.900" style="s2">sake because I think what what Nora is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.280" end="00:42:34.420" style="s2">doing and you know what guys doing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.900" end="00:42:36.310" style="s2">circling I like what Nora&#39;s doing though</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.420" end="00:42:37.750" style="s2">because it&#39;s got this topical element to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.310" end="00:42:40.390" style="s2">it that I think is really important in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.750" end="00:42:42.940" style="s2">central and it&#39;s got this ability it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.390" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">got its got a grammar built in of of you</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.940" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">know explicit restructuring and the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:48.460" style="s2">people move around and I think these are</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:50.110" style="s2">important things to take note of and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.460" end="00:42:54.010" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was taking note of them but</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.110" end="00:42:56.560" style="s2">towards your question Tim is that these</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.010" end="00:42:58.150" style="s2">practices give people a deep taste what</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.560" end="00:43:01.900" style="s2">I call a participatory and perspective</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.860" end="00:43:12.630" style="s2">like this term and but it&#39;s you know of</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.949" end="00:43:59.289" style="s2">they feel connected and involved with</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.499" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">and involved with not just theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.289" end="00:44:04.239" style="s2">about they feel participatory in the</p>

<p begin="00:44:06.789" end="00:44:12.219" style="s2">people if you can give these practices</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.219" end="00:44:15.219" style="s2">have a value I would argue in helping</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.219" end="00:44:17.380" style="s2">people remember in you know in their in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.219" end="00:44:20.559" style="s2">the sense of sati right mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.380" end="00:44:22.420" style="s2">deeply remember you know and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.559" end="00:44:23.859" style="s2">use this taste metaphor like in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.420" end="00:44:25.569" style="s2">Bible you know taste the Lord and see</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.859" end="00:44:28.449" style="s2">that he is good right they can they can</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.569" end="00:44:30.940" style="s2">remember what this is like what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.449" end="00:44:33.640" style="s2">like to be immersed in this to flow with</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.940" end="00:44:36.779" style="s2">this and I think that gives people a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.640" end="00:44:40.269" style="s2">kind of faith encourage that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.779" end="00:44:43.209" style="s2">realizable and relevant right here right</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.269" end="00:44:44.979" style="s2">now that&#39;s so yes on being the nerdish</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.209" end="00:44:46.719" style="s2">scientist and I&#39;m really excited and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.979" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">interested about what Noor is talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.719" end="00:44:51.009" style="s2">about you know as a scientist but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.880" end="00:44:53.349" style="s2">think I can make I think I just made it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.009" end="00:44:55.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a case for this the existential</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.349" end="00:44:57.549" style="s2">import of what we&#39;re discussing I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.299" end="00:44:59.969" style="s2">is also apparent and should be should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.549" end="00:44:59.969" style="s2">noted</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.799" end="00:45:06.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not how I would response year</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.000" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">that sort of reframing I think they here</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.690" end="00:45:15.809" style="s2">I think we&#39;re there is we have we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:17.789" style="s2">have a kind of stereoscopic vision where</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.809" end="00:45:20.130" style="s2">the the theoretical concern and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.789" end="00:45:22.859" style="s2">existential concern are both actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.130" end="00:45:25.410" style="s2">being infused into a kind of depth in</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.859" end="00:45:28.700" style="s2">which that is a value to us right here</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.410" end="00:45:31.319" style="s2">right now hmm well that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.700" end="00:45:33.869" style="s2">called for in this time and I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.319" end="00:45:36.269" style="s2">the framing of the concepts of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.869" end="00:45:39.569" style="s2">interior and the exterior is part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.269" end="00:45:42.690" style="s2">what is may be helpful to presence here</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.569" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">as well so core to how I&#39;ve been one way</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.690" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve been attempting to communicate the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:51.690" style="s2">project I&#39;ve been on with this for some</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:53.190" style="s2">years is to and I&#39;m not like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.690" end="00:45:55.710" style="s2">happy with this framing necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.190" end="00:45:57.450" style="s2">there&#39;s other things I would prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.710" end="00:46:00.779" style="s2">say but what I have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.450" end="00:46:02.849" style="s2">explicitly in places is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.779" end="00:46:04.230" style="s2">making sense of what to care about and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.849" end="00:46:06.660" style="s2">of course it&#39;s more like caring about</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.230" end="00:46:08.940" style="s2">making sense of what to care about but</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.660" end="00:46:10.170" style="s2">there&#39;s because there&#39;s this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.940" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">sense in which these things are so</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.170" end="00:46:15.029" style="s2">interdependent yet there is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:19.109" style="s2">orientation towards I think ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.029" end="00:46:21.569" style="s2">grounded in something like of love and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.109" end="00:46:23.700" style="s2">for love that&#39;s I think better made</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.569" end="00:46:25.619" style="s2">better related to in a language of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.700" end="00:46:28.049" style="s2">perhaps care or towards that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.619" end="00:46:29.400" style="s2">metaphorical way rather than sense but</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.049" end="00:46:32.039" style="s2">we are here in this moment together</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.400" end="00:46:34.500" style="s2">where so much is shifting and it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.039" end="00:46:38.309" style="s2">can we draw in what is most relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.500" end="00:46:39.390" style="s2">also be anchored in what is what is most</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.309" end="00:46:41.069" style="s2">worth caring about</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.390" end="00:46:44.609" style="s2">and so it&#39;s bringing these two together</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.069" end="00:46:47.430" style="s2">in the process absolutely that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.609" end="00:46:49.109" style="s2">be so fundamental well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.430" end="00:46:51.269" style="s2">Socrates taught erotica</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.109" end="00:46:54.269" style="s2">Socrates knew how to care and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.269" end="00:46:57.569" style="s2">central idea in Heidegger like the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.269" end="00:46:59.940" style="s2">the the the you know the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.569" end="00:47:01.769" style="s2">caring well and you know that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.940" end="00:47:03.509" style="s2">think and I want to turn it back to Nora</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.769" end="00:47:05.849" style="s2">now that&#39;s what I think the work I do on</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.509" end="00:47:09.269" style="s2">relevance realization seems to line up I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.849" end="00:47:10.950" style="s2">think I have a sense I&#39;m not clear yet</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.269" end="00:47:12.150" style="s2">but it seems at least it&#39;s convergent</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.950" end="00:47:12.829" style="s2">with what she stopped talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.150" end="00:47:13.980" style="s2">she&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.829" end="00:47:17.089" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.980" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">this abductive process that&#39;s at work</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.089" end="00:47:23.220" style="s2">because that comes up a lot in in in in</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.880" end="00:47:25.740" style="s2">my work too and so I want to turn it</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.220" end="00:47:29.220" style="s2">back to normal and I want to hear more</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.740" end="00:47:31.050" style="s2">about this abductive process mmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.220" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">the abductive process is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.050" end="00:47:41.910" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m pretty sure that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:45.089" style="s2">that&#39;s where the change actually is and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.910" end="00:47:50.070" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is is largely</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.089" end="00:47:53.670" style="s2">missing from most of the diagrams of and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.070" end="00:47:56.010" style="s2">explanations of systems change there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.670" end="00:47:57.660" style="s2">it&#39;s actually in the abductive process</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.010" end="00:48:02.940" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to get the real shift</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.660" end="00:48:08.310" style="s2">and and that&#39;s really I would say in in</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.940" end="00:48:11.190" style="s2">my sort of verbage around this that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.310" end="00:48:13.800" style="s2">very trends contextual yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.190" end="00:48:18.329" style="s2">happening across them through multiple</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.800" end="00:48:21.240" style="s2">content and it requires that and we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.329" end="00:48:24.390" style="s2">it all the time anyway mmm it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.240" end="00:48:27.780" style="s2">matter of allowing for a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.390" end="00:48:30.690" style="s2">abductive process so if if I&#39;m in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.780" end="00:48:34.920" style="s2">abductive process where my identity is</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.690" end="00:48:37.800" style="s2">formed through and across the various</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.920" end="00:48:41.430" style="s2">institutions of our world my education</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.800" end="00:48:45.869" style="s2">my job my family my wealth my economy my</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.430" end="00:48:50.040" style="s2">health my sexuality my gender my right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.869" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">all of these things and and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.040" end="00:48:55.170" style="s2">them are describing each other that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the piece that when it when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.170" end="00:48:59.900" style="s2">get it it&#39;s like oh that there it is but</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a little tricky to do in a you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.900" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">40-minute podcast but the thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:17.190" style="s2">that in there there is another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:20.220" style="s2">integrity so when when I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.190" end="00:49:20.550" style="s2">abductive shift in groups with groups of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.220" end="00:49:24.510" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.550" end="00:49:26.099" style="s2">I don&#39;t guide it know I just make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.510" end="00:49:27.630" style="s2">space for it and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.099" end="00:49:32.520" style="s2">critical</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.630" end="00:49:35.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t ever ever make any inclination</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.520" end="00:49:36.750" style="s2">of what I think people should learn or</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.250" end="00:49:38.940" style="s2">could come out the other end of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.750" end="00:49:43.950" style="s2">thinking because I feel like that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.940" end="00:49:45.900" style="s2">absolutely not my territory I can make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.950" end="00:49:48.030" style="s2">space for those connections to happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.900" end="00:49:50.670" style="s2">but they should be alive they should be</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.030" end="00:49:53.310" style="s2">as complex and as unique as every person</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.670" end="00:49:57.060" style="s2">in that room with infinite possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.310" end="00:50:03.240" style="s2">of connecting their ideas and stories</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.060" end="00:50:06.180" style="s2">and inputs so it&#39;s it&#39;s very alive and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.240" end="00:50:09.900" style="s2">that living thing is totally</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.180" end="00:50:12.810" style="s2">unpredictable at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.900" end="00:50:17.250" style="s2">pretty predictable every time I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.810" end="00:50:19.110" style="s2">it there&#39;s been a shift um and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.250" end="00:50:23.100" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the details of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.110" end="00:50:25.860" style="s2">shift are I don&#39;t get to voice or shape</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.100" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">or define or in any way describe that</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.860" end="00:50:34.620" style="s2">shift I can only make a space for it so</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:36.840" style="s2">what people are able to do when they</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.620" end="00:50:40.560" style="s2">start to move across those contexts as</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.840" end="00:50:44.270" style="s2">they can see the way in which they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.560" end="00:50:49.700" style="s2">interdependent and that perception</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.270" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">without any effort has the second-order</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.700" end="00:50:55.590" style="s2">response of a kind of integrity it has</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:57.660" style="s2">to do with recognizing not integrity</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.590" end="00:51:05.070" style="s2">around what&#39;s right or wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.660" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">integrity to show up and respond in ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.070" end="00:51:09.540" style="s2">that are inclusive of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:13.710" style="s2">interdependence II as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.540" end="00:51:17.250" style="s2">looking at one one sort of solution in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.710" end="00:51:20.520" style="s2">one context at a time or or one one</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.250" end="00:51:23.190" style="s2">trauma in one context at a time you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.520" end="00:51:26.850" style="s2">so often trauma gets put into really</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.190" end="00:51:29.670" style="s2">reductionist terms and so there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.850" end="00:51:31.410" style="s2">of a therapeutic and a healing quality</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.670" end="00:51:32.850" style="s2">to this that is that think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.410" end="00:51:37.050" style="s2">talking about when we say people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.850" end="00:51:41.530" style="s2">longing this connection that in in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.050" end="00:51:43.800" style="s2">longing what happens is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.530" end="00:51:47.650" style="s2">start to see that this thing that is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.800" end="00:51:52.750" style="s2">trauma that you might be carrying is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.650" end="00:51:55.690" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not actually located in</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.750" end="00:51:59.260" style="s2">any particular context it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.690" end="00:52:02.260" style="s2">between all of them and other people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.260" end="00:52:04.690" style="s2">sharing other traumas that are woven</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.260" end="00:52:10.180" style="s2">between all these different contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.690" end="00:52:15.150" style="s2">suddenly that trauma isn&#39;t as internal</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.180" end="00:52:17.950" style="s2">it becomes something that is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.150" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">perceivably contextual and trans</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.950" end="00:52:23.620" style="s2">contextual which is an enormous relief</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:26.260" style="s2">and when I say it&#39;s warm data it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.620" end="00:52:33.160" style="s2">like literally warm you can literally</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.260" end="00:52:35.530" style="s2">feel the warmth of that so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.160" end="00:52:42.820" style="s2">interesting to see that and especially</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.530" end="00:52:52.990" style="s2">in this moment which i think is a moment</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.820" end="00:52:57.880" style="s2">of a need for a completely it&#39;s a need</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.990" end="00:53:00.730" style="s2">to integrate in another way yeah so how</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.880" end="00:53:06.280" style="s2">do we begin to create the conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.730" end="00:53:10.900" style="s2">people to integrate together into a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.280" end="00:53:14.170" style="s2">of seeing and and responding to this</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.900" end="00:53:14.890" style="s2">time I think that&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.170" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.890" end="00:53:20.140" style="s2">and I&#39;m particularly interested in one</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:22.780" style="s2">aspect of that question that I alluded</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.140" end="00:53:24.310" style="s2">to or I mentioned earlier which is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.780" end="00:53:26.980" style="s2">interested in what are the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.310" end="00:53:28.390" style="s2">that afford insight for people and how</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.980" end="00:53:29.860" style="s2">those interact with what are those what</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.390" end="00:53:33.370" style="s2">are the conditions that afford insight</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.860" end="00:53:36.220" style="s2">between people and how and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.370" end="00:53:37.150" style="s2">kind of a third thing what is the what</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.220" end="00:53:41.530" style="s2">is sort of the optimal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.150" end="00:53:44.860" style="s2">between the the the individual insight</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.530" end="00:53:47.560" style="s2">and the collective insight and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.860" end="00:53:51.070" style="s2">something I&#39;m trying to get a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.560" end="00:53:54.430" style="s2">understanding of III think that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.070" end="00:53:55.510" style="s2">that people are enacting and literally</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.430" end="00:53:58.150" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.510" end="00:54:00.190" style="s2">and they&#39;re embodying the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.150" end="00:54:02.980" style="s2">interdependence I think that is probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.190" end="00:54:06.040" style="s2">playing a very significant role in in</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.980" end="00:54:07.780" style="s2">the practice because you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.040" end="00:54:09.970" style="s2">triggering the cerebellum you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.780" end="00:54:11.470" style="s2">people to literally reorient their</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.970" end="00:54:12.940" style="s2">visual processing what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.470" end="00:54:15.550" style="s2">foregrounding and back rounding is</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.940" end="00:54:17.140" style="s2">literally shifting we know that those</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.550" end="00:54:19.120" style="s2">kind of processes trigger individual</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.140" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">insight and then if they&#39;re and if that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.120" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">if that&#39;s an insight that also you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:26.080" style="s2">gets them to realize the interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:28.630" style="s2">then I can see how the groups would also</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.080" end="00:54:35.320" style="s2">restructure collectively so that various</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.630" end="00:54:38.140" style="s2">things are again being facilitated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.320" end="00:54:39.640" style="s2">interesting about this maybe I can form</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.140" end="00:54:42.360" style="s2">a question around that bridge that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.640" end="00:54:45.370" style="s2">just made because when you look within</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.360" end="00:54:47.290" style="s2">individual cognition inducing</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.370" end="00:54:50.080" style="s2">criticality you have to introduce some</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.290" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">significant amount of disruption like if</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.080" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">if you hear somebody&#39;s trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:55.480" style="s2">an insight problem on a computer screen</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:57.610" style="s2">you put some static or some noise and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.480" end="00:54:59.980" style="s2">put its a bit of entropy in it or you</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.610" end="00:55:01.630" style="s2">allow or or you moderately distract them</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.980" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">not to distracted so they leave the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.630" end="00:55:06.940" style="s2">problem but enough that they&#39;ll sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:09.400" style="s2">you know they get you break up the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.940" end="00:55:11.170" style="s2">stability and that criticality actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.400" end="00:55:13.540" style="s2">affords the restructuring like the way a</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.170" end="00:55:15.100" style="s2">sand pile will self organize and then it</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.540" end="00:55:19.510" style="s2">avalanches and that affords a new</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.100" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">structure so I&#39;m wondering if if if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.510" end="00:55:24.760" style="s2">if you see that playing a role within</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:26.860" style="s2">the one data that there&#39;s there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.760" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.860" end="00:55:32.530" style="s2">there a presence of disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:34.690" style="s2">strategies sort of being played with you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.530" end="00:55:36.700" style="s2">know in contrast but interdependently</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.690" end="00:55:38.320" style="s2">with constructive strategies you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.700" end="00:55:39.850" style="s2">seeing that the criticality in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.320" end="00:55:42.360" style="s2">construction are sort of mutually</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.850" end="00:55:45.670" style="s2">interpenetrating is that happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.360" end="00:55:47.590" style="s2">absolutely because when people go into</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.670" end="00:55:49.600" style="s2">so if you get up from one context and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.590" end="00:55:51.700" style="s2">you walk over to another one</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.600" end="00:55:55.510" style="s2">what is induction yeah yeah right you</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.700" end="00:55:57.850" style="s2">you have to actually you know come into</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.510" end="00:56:00.820" style="s2">that so there&#39;s a lot of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.850" end="00:56:04.180" style="s2">happening who&#39;s here there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.820" end="00:56:08.050" style="s2">process of paying attention in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.180" end="00:56:09.380" style="s2">are all sorts of nonverbal attention and</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.050" end="00:56:12.820" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.380" end="00:56:15.290" style="s2">in engaging in that conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.820" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2">bringing with you this conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.290" end="00:56:20.030" style="s2">just came on board and maybe the one</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:23.180" style="s2">before that because it&#39;s usually the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.030" end="00:56:25.940" style="s2">third context that you start to get the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.180" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">the pop yeah that makes sense to me and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.940" end="00:56:35.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s also being in a room where</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:36.770" style="s2">there are all those contexts so you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.000" end="00:56:41.150" style="s2">you&#39;re in a room where there is this</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.770" end="00:56:44.390" style="s2">meta right and that background to some</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.150" end="00:56:46.340" style="s2">degree right that&#39;s right yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.390" end="00:56:48.680" style="s2">that you don&#39;t get to forget that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.340" end="00:56:54.800" style="s2">in this meta which is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.680" end="00:56:59.420" style="s2">it it actually it really decreases the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.800" end="00:57:01.460" style="s2">possibility for polarization which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.420" end="00:57:03.560" style="s2">really really interesting especially in</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.460" end="00:57:07.340" style="s2">you know in these times where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.560" end="00:57:09.740" style="s2">been so much polarization that you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.340" end="00:57:11.750" style="s2">usually we go traveling down a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.740" end="00:57:15.230" style="s2">hole because we feel like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.750" end="00:57:16.610" style="s2">context someone&#39;s not seeing and but if</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.230" end="00:57:18.890" style="s2">it&#39;s in the room and it&#39;s just over</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.610" end="00:57:22.610" style="s2">there you can just go over there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.890" end="00:57:27.650" style="s2">not people are less prone to positioning</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.610" end="00:57:30.080" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s that and that is I guess</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.650" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">you could call that a disruptor but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.080" end="00:57:35.180" style="s2">a gentle one yeah I think it&#39;s also you</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.920" end="00:57:37.700" style="s2">know you don&#39;t wanna you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.180" end="00:57:39.590" style="s2">break the system right now you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.700" end="00:57:41.810" style="s2">perturb it because if you don&#39;t perturb</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.590" end="00:57:44.030" style="s2">it enough you know it&#39;ll get into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.810" end="00:57:47.600" style="s2">local minima it&#39;ll stabilize prematurely</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.030" end="00:57:50.150" style="s2">and then people can often not you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.600" end="00:57:55.640" style="s2">explore this space of possibilities as</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.150" end="00:57:58.370" style="s2">deeply as as is probably needed and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.640" end="00:58:01.520" style="s2">other thing is that I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.370" end="00:58:03.800" style="s2">talked about topics yeah and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.520" end="00:58:06.110" style="s2">things that is really important is to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.800" end="00:58:08.840" style="s2">not have topics where people have</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.110" end="00:58:11.180" style="s2">scripts so that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.840" end="00:58:12.470" style="s2">question how do you do that because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.180" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">know a lot of the a lot of the things</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.470" end="00:58:17.840" style="s2">you brought up as examples struck me as</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:21.050" style="s2">one which people often have you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.840" end="00:58:22.910" style="s2">pretty firm opinions that have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.050" end="00:58:24.620" style="s2">cultural</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.910" end="00:58:27.140" style="s2">Baga to touch them like health for</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.620" end="00:58:28.790" style="s2">example like you know people have lots</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.140" end="00:58:30.680" style="s2">of opinions about health of course now</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.790" end="00:58:33.710" style="s2">even more so and there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.680" end="00:58:34.970" style="s2">cultural valuation of health han says</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.710" end="00:58:37.940" style="s2">you know that health has become our God</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.970" end="00:58:40.600" style="s2">in some ways it&#39;s every it&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.940" end="00:58:42.860" style="s2">that justifies everything else we do so</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.600" end="00:58:45.380" style="s2">what does that mean that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.860" end="00:58:47.570" style="s2">provocative what you just said how would</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.380" end="00:58:49.460" style="s2">you bring up like that let&#39;s do that one</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.570" end="00:58:51.230" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually relevant to how</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.460" end="00:58:54.800" style="s2">would you bring up health and keep it</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.230" end="00:58:58.910" style="s2">off script how does that work well you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.800" end="00:59:01.090" style="s2">might bring up family hmm okay if I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.910" end="00:59:06.320" style="s2">working with a bunch of doctors</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.090" end="00:59:11.330" style="s2">um I might bring use family health be</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.320" end="00:59:16.100" style="s2">one of the contexts I see I see so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.330" end="00:59:18.950" style="s2">you get this right you get it off-center</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.100" end="00:59:21.620" style="s2">so that you can actually reorient and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.950" end="00:59:22.580" style="s2">read that the abductive processes move</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.620" end="00:59:25.220" style="s2">in other ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.580" end="00:59:27.620" style="s2">oh that&#39;s very good that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.220" end="00:59:29.450" style="s2">yeah because these centering strategies</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.620" end="00:59:31.670" style="s2">also are things found with an individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.450" end="00:59:34.100" style="s2">cognition and insight so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.670" end="00:59:34.580" style="s2">interesting of that murren that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.100" end="00:59:37.970" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.580" end="00:59:40.580" style="s2">I had one recently and and this I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.970" end="00:59:42.710" style="s2">Tim this really is important with your</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.580" end="00:59:45.950" style="s2">question around authenticity because</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.710" end="00:59:49.100" style="s2">this is this is kind of critical is how</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.950" end="00:59:55.640" style="s2">to get off of these scripts and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.100" end="00:59:58.790" style="s2">scripts have meaning and have have I</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.640" end="01:00:02.050" style="s2">haven&#39;t have a set of signaling and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.790" end="01:00:06.560" style="s2">receiving possibilities within</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.050" end="01:00:08.090" style="s2">relationships if you if you are in a set</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.560" end="01:00:10.820" style="s2">of different relationships those</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.090" end="01:00:14.510" style="s2">signaling zs-- don&#39;t go anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.820" end="01:00:20.210" style="s2">you can still signal they just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.510" end="01:00:23.570" style="s2">dud so it&#39;s it&#39;s something to get off</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.210" end="01:00:28.340" style="s2">context too if you have a bunch of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.570" end="01:00:32.180" style="s2">know doctors talking about media for</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.340" end="01:00:34.130" style="s2">example and family and suddenly that</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.180" end="01:00:35.880" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of health stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.130" end="01:00:39.809" style="s2">is implicit in there</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.880" end="01:00:42.599" style="s2">and it connects in but it isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.809" end="01:00:45.269" style="s2">they&#39;re saying so it&#39;s this thing of not</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.599" end="01:00:47.240" style="s2">going for the direct corrective which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.269" end="01:00:55.890" style="s2">going to generate all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.240" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">reductionist scripted maybe I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.890" end="01:01:00.329" style="s2">how that connects to authenticity but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.839" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">know that when people don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.329" end="01:01:05.180" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna say and they haven&#39;t said</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:08.730" style="s2">that thing before and they were</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.180" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">considering the the thing that was going</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.730" end="01:01:14.339" style="s2">to come from the person that just said a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:16.890" style="s2">thing that that they they enter into a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.339" end="01:01:19.710" style="s2">discourse in another way they enter into</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.890" end="01:01:23.339" style="s2">a mutual learning in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.710" end="01:01:24.720" style="s2">surprises even them but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.339" end="01:01:27.269" style="s2">excellent connection to authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:30.180" style="s2">Nora I mean there&#39;s a deep connection</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.269" end="01:01:32.609" style="s2">between getting off script and what</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.180" end="01:01:35.670" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do here I mean right it</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.609" end="01:01:37.079" style="s2">is in this special identity is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.670" end="01:01:38.250" style="s2">trying to get I mean there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.079" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">meta level we&#39;re trying to get off</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.250" end="01:01:42.119" style="s2">script about authenticity and it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:44.400" style="s2">it&#39;s now that well part of what this</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.119" end="01:01:46.859" style="s2">attempt to reformulate authenticity is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.400" end="01:01:49.470" style="s2">is centering on is the very capacity and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.859" end="01:01:51.059" style="s2">ability to get off script but do it like</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.470" end="01:01:52.529" style="s2">you said you have to do it in this if</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.059" end="01:01:54.599" style="s2">you do it you know you have to do it in</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.529" end="01:01:56.039" style="s2">a certain way you have to pick you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.599" end="01:01:57.329" style="s2">to get it like if it&#39;s health and you go</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.039" end="01:01:58.769" style="s2">off center because you actually talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.329" end="01:02:00.660" style="s2">about family you wouldn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.769" end="01:02:03.480" style="s2">like elephants for example right you</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.660" end="01:02:06.450" style="s2">it&#39;s about it&#39;s you&#39;ve got it like so</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.480" end="01:02:08.759" style="s2">there&#39;s finesse in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.450" end="01:02:10.529" style="s2">there&#39;s finesse in this if you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.759" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">a Tai Chi player and there&#39;s this sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.529" end="01:02:15.779" style="s2">about you know a can you can you pick up</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:18.390" style="s2">on the grain of things and follow the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.779" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">grain and and get a sense of how you</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.390" end="01:02:21.960" style="s2">know well you know you&#39;re sparring with</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:24.150" style="s2">somebody as you said you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.960" end="01:02:26.940" style="s2">just hit them because they&#39;ll just flock</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.150" end="01:02:28.680" style="s2">but can you get them off center and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.940" end="01:02:31.710" style="s2">there&#39;s possibilities that open up and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.680" end="01:02:34.559" style="s2">so I think I think I like what you just</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.710" end="01:02:39.299" style="s2">said I like this idea about a connection</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.559" end="01:02:41.369" style="s2">between a rican sexual ization perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.299" end="01:02:44.250" style="s2">of authenticity by connecting it to</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.369" end="01:02:46.789" style="s2">getting people off script in you know in</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.250" end="01:02:49.109" style="s2">a way that shows finesse and affords</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.789" end="01:02:49.480" style="s2">inside it I think that&#39;s a very I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.109" end="01:02:51.820" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.480" end="01:02:54.970" style="s2">very powerfully connected to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.820" end="01:02:59.400" style="s2">talking about with authenticity yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.970" end="01:02:59.400" style="s2">that all of this rings very true and</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.770" end="01:03:07.690" style="s2">there&#39;s some things I can presence here</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.240" end="01:03:10.450" style="s2">that I think are vital and I supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.690" end="01:03:16.650" style="s2">go metal on it the turn is for me to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.450" end="01:03:16.650" style="s2">speak personally the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.680" end="01:03:24.970" style="s2">when we drop into the personal and move</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.090" end="01:03:27.720" style="s2">towards where we are vulnerable this has</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.970" end="01:03:27.720" style="s2">an effect on</p>

<p begin="01:03:44.109" end="01:03:50.649" style="s2">at least potentially and this is very</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.719" end="01:03:52.659" style="s2">significant and this is an obstacle not</p>

<p begin="01:03:52.659" end="01:03:58.299" style="s2">but an obstacle we all here face this</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.529" end="01:04:01.479" style="s2">notion of off-script is something that</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.299" end="01:04:05.709" style="s2">has had much resonance with me for a</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.479" end="01:04:06.309" style="s2">long time I in fact set up an event last</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.709" end="01:04:09.909" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.309" end="01:04:12.519" style="s2">I hired out a theater and the event was</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.909" end="01:04:16.299" style="s2">called off script and I attempted to</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.519" end="01:04:19.509" style="s2">have people come along to that event but</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.299" end="01:04:23.259" style="s2">I cancelled it because I could not get</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.509" end="01:04:29.300" style="s2">anyone to come so the question is how</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.259" end="01:04:31.850" style="s2">then do you invite a setting where</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.300" end="01:04:35.750" style="s2">can&#39;t go off-script because the price is</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.850" end="01:04:40.340" style="s2">high the price of admission is much</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.750" end="01:04:42.290" style="s2">higher than a ticket because really if</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.340" end="01:04:44.750" style="s2">we were to open up again to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.290" end="01:04:49.340" style="s2">significance we are here a part of this</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.530" end="01:04:59.390" style="s2">with death and perhaps worse that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.190" end="01:05:02.990" style="s2">there the various ways in which we may</p>

<p begin="01:05:10.690" end="01:05:20.230" style="s2">in suffering I think all magnifies each</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.200" end="01:05:20.230" style="s2">other and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.790" end="01:05:26.550" style="s2">yes things are about going off-script</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.030" end="01:05:28.050" style="s2">and they always have been and whether or</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.550" end="01:05:30.810" style="s2">not we were aware of it part of us</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.050" end="01:05:33.780" style="s2">always was we just lost awareness of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.810" end="01:05:37.260" style="s2">even as we ran out certain programs and</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.780" end="01:05:40.500" style="s2">mistook perhaps programs before the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.260" end="01:05:42.810" style="s2">totality but there are it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.500" end="01:05:45.300" style="s2">things we can&#39;t stand on and ground</p>

<p begin="01:05:48.290" end="01:05:57.470" style="s2">imperatives that we can or cannot accept</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.210" end="01:06:00.990" style="s2">a covenant if you like we can enter into</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.470" end="01:06:02.910" style="s2">of course all things can be broken but</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.990" end="01:06:05.930" style="s2">there are consequences to those to that</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.910" end="01:06:08.970" style="s2">breaking and so as we are here</p>

<p begin="01:06:51.960" end="01:06:58.260" style="s2">then truly commit to being here with</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.119" end="01:07:03.089" style="s2">each other and just how much are we able</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.260" end="01:07:09.500" style="s2">to integrate through that process even</p>

<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:54.520" style="s2">this is landed I it strikes me that what</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.090" end="01:08:02.380" style="s2">what what you&#39;re talking about is a kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.520" end="01:08:05.410" style="s2">of rigor and that it&#39;s a rigor that I I</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.380" end="01:08:11.530" style="s2">have so much affection for because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.410" end="01:08:14.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a rigor for perceiving and looking</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.530" end="01:08:18.270" style="s2">for maybe with that wonder that you were</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.710" end="01:08:24.390" style="s2">speaking of earlier John hmm</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.270" end="01:08:27.280" style="s2">you know interdependency is a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.390" end="01:08:30.870" style="s2">differences a lot of vitality &#39;he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.280" end="01:08:37.000" style="s2">lot of interactions a lot of relational</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.870" end="01:08:46.050" style="s2">messiness and it&#39;s not to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.000" end="01:08:52.200" style="s2">underestimated the kind of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.050" end="01:08:58.320" style="s2">multi sensory perception that it takes</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.200" end="01:09:01.900" style="s2">to pay attention in that way and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.320" end="01:09:06.580" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not as if you can just do</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.900" end="01:09:11.230" style="s2">complexity as an intellectual game right</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.580" end="01:09:14.050" style="s2">it&#39;s if you don&#39;t allow that complexity</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.230" end="01:09:19.870" style="s2">to be perceived through your own</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.050" end="01:09:23.710" style="s2">complexity that is not just in words or</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.870" end="01:09:27.670" style="s2">jargons or maps but also in stories and</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.710" end="01:09:30.310" style="s2">music and unspoken sensed things and all</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.670" end="01:09:32.960" style="s2">kinds of other information that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.310" end="01:09:34.720" style="s2">you need all of it</p>

<p begin="01:09:34.720" end="01:09:44.030" style="s2">integrity or that authenticity it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.390" end="01:09:46.940" style="s2">kind of alertness in the rigor and so I</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.030" end="01:09:49.070" style="s2">guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m kind of hearing</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.940" end="01:09:51.410" style="s2">you say right off the bat what do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.070" end="01:09:52.880" style="s2">think John what are you hearing well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.410" end="01:09:56.150" style="s2">hearing something similar to that and</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.880" end="01:09:58.640" style="s2">overlaps with it and I&#39;m hearing the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.150" end="01:10:05.660" style="s2">commitment and I like the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.640" end="01:10:08.030" style="s2">rigor I&#39;m hearing that noir that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.660" end="01:10:10.370" style="s2">you talk about things I used the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.030" end="01:10:12.290" style="s2">language of kinds of knowing that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.370" end="01:10:13.820" style="s2">not propositional there&#39;s procedural</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.290" end="01:10:15.770" style="s2">knowing and respect travel and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.820" end="01:10:18.440" style="s2">participatory and I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.770" end="01:10:20.240" style="s2">saying is the knowing and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.440" end="01:10:23.030" style="s2">knowing that knowledge deliberately</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.240" end="01:10:25.450" style="s2">knowing of complexity is something we</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.030" end="01:10:27.800" style="s2">only know within and through our own</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.450" end="01:10:29.810" style="s2">complexity right it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.800" end="01:10:31.310" style="s2">participatory knowing it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.810" end="01:10:35.990" style="s2">referential knowing and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.310" end="01:10:39.050" style="s2">really important and so I&#39;m hearing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.990" end="01:10:45.950" style="s2">the commitment therefore is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.050" end="01:10:52.570" style="s2">comprehensive commitment to I like this</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.950" end="01:10:52.570" style="s2">notion of rigor about trying to bring I</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.160" end="01:11:00.140" style="s2">well let me let me try it this way what</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.040" end="01:11:01.970" style="s2">I heard when I heard that rigor and that</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.140" end="01:11:04.100" style="s2">you took it to those deep levels in</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.970" end="01:11:06.440" style="s2">response to Tim he&#39;s like I said I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:11:33.590" end="01:11:37.700" style="s2">why the Aristotelian model of the virtue</p>

<p begin="01:12:32.460" end="01:12:38.700" style="s2">about virtue at some point that these</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.560" end="01:12:40.950" style="s2">practices should result in people</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.700" end="01:12:43.350" style="s2">carrying away in their person not</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.950" end="01:12:45.960" style="s2">beliefs but carrying away skills and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.350" end="01:12:48.840" style="s2">virtues that transfer into multiple</p>

<p begin="01:12:48.840" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">think the meta virtue of course is</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.060" end="01:12:58.290" style="s2">wisdom and so I that&#39;s what I think is</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:13:00.540" style="s2">the normativity that I heard you</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.290" end="01:13:03.390" style="s2">pointing towards Tim and I think when</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.540" end="01:13:04.590" style="s2">you can when people can realize and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.390" end="01:13:06.840" style="s2">mean that in both senses of the word</p>

<p begin="01:13:21.930" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">and and guide it I think that&#39;s deeply</p>

<p begin="01:13:29.880" end="01:13:34.710" style="s2">goes back towards you know giving them a</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.980" end="01:13:36.540" style="s2">taste but a taste of the good if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.710" end="01:13:38.250" style="s2">allow me a platonic word and you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.540" end="01:13:40.140" style="s2">what you know what Nora was talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.250" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">about sounded so similar to me - what</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.140" end="01:13:44.940" style="s2">Iris Murdoch talks about when she talks</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">about the you know the the the necessity</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.940" end="01:13:50.280" style="s2">for paying you know - for a particular</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:51.600" style="s2">kind of complex attention and she it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.280" end="01:13:54.900" style="s2">called the sovereignty of the good for a</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.600" end="01:13:56.910" style="s2">reason she she allies that capacity with</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.900" end="01:13:58.920" style="s2">the ability to orient towards the good</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.910" end="01:14:00.130" style="s2">to love the good to be tempted by the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.920" end="01:14:02.320" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.130" end="01:14:05.290" style="s2">and I think when people get a taste for</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.320" end="01:14:08.920" style="s2">this Tim that could really afford the</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.290" end="01:14:10.900" style="s2">kind of commitment that you&#39;re talking</p>
