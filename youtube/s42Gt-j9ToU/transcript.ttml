<p begin="00:00:05.000" end="00:00:10.019" style="s2">so I want to do a very short standalone</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:11.550" style="s2">clip in response to something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:14.370" style="s2">Daniel SH macton Berger was sharing in</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.550" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">the war on sense-making pieces which</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.370" end="00:00:17.490" style="s2">were all about how the information</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">ecology is damaged and what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:21.210" style="s2">start doing about that how we might</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:23.490" style="s2">start getting a more healthy information</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:26.279" style="s2">ecology I&#39;ve been thinking about some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.490" end="00:00:28.170" style="s2">the like rural omega being one of those</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:30.630" style="s2">things like giving giving someone the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.170" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">benefit of the doubt and hoping that by</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.630" end="00:00:33.899" style="s2">doing that can start to tease out the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">meaning and then we go enter sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.899" end="00:00:37.469" style="s2">into subjective sense making process</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">together that&#39;s more than the sum of its</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.469" end="00:00:41.180" style="s2">parts I was thinking about whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:43.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a rule Omega for interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.180" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">dialogue and I was also thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">how like in my personal life I&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">of evolved towards a rule of not to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:55.379" style="s2">and if this is about gossip as well and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a really interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.379" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">about kind of what the value of like you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">could call it gossip or talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">other people plays there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.070" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">lot of thought about that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">actually quite it&#39;s a really valuable</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">thing for communities to do because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">helps police or enforce boundaries in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">terms of our interactions with each</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">other knowing how people have treated</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">others in the past and that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">interesting kind of area</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">I think the sapiens guy writes about</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">gossip in that way at how it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:30.390" style="s2">really important thing you Val know</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">Harare and so my kind of nascent rule</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">Omega is I try if I have something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">I will say about someone I will make</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">sure that I&#39;ve said that to that person</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">like I don&#39;t feel comfortable saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">something about someone that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">actually said to their face and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve kind of evolved</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">towards of like what feels right for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">in terms of when I realize I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">about someone behind their back or</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:55.409" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s like I feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">saying something as long as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.409" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">aware of that I&#39;ve had that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">with them and then given them a chance</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:03.509" style="s2">to respond made it clear what my</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">position is if you imagine that as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">gonna rule Omega rule a rule Delta or</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">something like that for interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">relations it does feel like that starts</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">to tidy up the information ecology the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:18.269" style="s2">because you know when you&#39;re expressing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">something if you&#39;re all behaved kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.269" end="00:02:20.430" style="s2">agreeing to that rule you know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">anything that you&#39;ve heard has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.430" end="00:02:24.170" style="s2">expressed to that person it like clears</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:26.819" style="s2">out it starts to clear out a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.170" end="00:02:28.019" style="s2">he-said she-said we said but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.819" end="00:02:30.090" style="s2">supposed to know this order than</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.019" end="00:02:33.269" style="s2">whatever and also I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.090" end="00:02:36.030" style="s2">that&#39;s part of being more centered being</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.269" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">more honest being like more grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:38.970" style="s2">in our lives when we&#39;re not having to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">keep track of who knows something and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.970" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">who knows something else and then which</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">story we&#39;ve told to this person if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:45.980" style="s2">allowed to share it with that person</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:48.209" style="s2">it&#39;s like that is a huge weight of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.980" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">storylines for us to keep in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.209" end="00:02:52.380" style="s2">at all times and it&#39;s really exhausting</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.370" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">and really sort stops us being really</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.380" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">present in our lives a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">as Jordan Peterson talks about if you or</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:01.049" style="s2">him towards truth it makes things a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">easier in our lives because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.049" end="00:03:04.709" style="s2">lot of stuff you don&#39;t have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">remembering all the time but then as</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.709" end="00:03:09.209" style="s2">Daniel explained in the second Warren</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">sense-making almost anything can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.209" end="00:03:13.019" style="s2">weaponized I want to go into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">exceptions on that as well but when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.019" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">was when I was following this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">this thought pattern of okay that could</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">be a rule Omega for interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:22.350" style="s2">dialogue if you know that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">about someone it&#39;s like and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.350" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">something we can then kind of enforce</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:26.850" style="s2">with each other if you hear someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.230" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">saying to you oh well this person did</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:29.850" style="s2">that or though though they&#39;re like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">you can say well I actually have used</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.850" end="00:03:33.269" style="s2">have you shared that with them like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">find myself doing that more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.269" end="00:03:36.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like well if you&#39;re telling me this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:38.190" style="s2">have you had that conversation with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:39.600" style="s2">person and then asking that person to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.190" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">maybe if you&#39;re going to share that with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.600" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">me you should really let them know you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:43.889" style="s2">should have that conversation and I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:45.000" style="s2">to go into kind of the exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.889" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">because there&#39;s always exceptions to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.000" end="00:03:48.780" style="s2">this rule but I was really struck when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:51.359" style="s2">kind of followed this this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.780" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">train of thought that that&#39;s also a rule</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.359" end="00:03:55.799" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of evolved as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">cardinal rules of journalism it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.799" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">right of reply that you learn very early</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:07.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you have any comment or or</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:08.819" style="s2">claim about anyone in an article one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.170" end="00:04:10.819" style="s2">the rules you have to put it to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.819" end="00:04:13.319" style="s2">personal a corporation or the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.819" end="00:04:15.299" style="s2">individual or whatever before you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.319" end="00:04:16.500" style="s2">publish it so you have to get the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.299" end="00:04:18.180" style="s2">of reply and you have to put that into</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.500" end="00:04:19.979" style="s2">your article which feels really fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.180" end="00:04:21.959" style="s2">like it and it&#39;s interesting that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">evolved as kind of naturally over time</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.959" end="00:04:26.669" style="s2">as a as a rule of within journalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">which is which is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.669" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">information a call</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:30.659" style="s2">there&#39;s another thing that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:32.330" style="s2">the war of sense-making too so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.659" end="00:04:35.789" style="s2">Daniel smacking burger said which then</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.330" end="00:04:37.889" style="s2">it kind of hit home for me after I heard</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.789" end="00:04:39.930" style="s2">a phrase just randomly which was</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.889" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">emotions or not instructions I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.930" end="00:04:43.469" style="s2">huh it&#39;s really interesting because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:45.449" style="s2">a mindfulness instructor as well but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.469" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">also do you know the kind of work we do</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.449" end="00:04:48.599" style="s2">as counselors and the inner growth work</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">is very much around what am I feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.599" end="00:04:52.319" style="s2">right now and bring that out but as</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:54.419" style="s2">Daniel pointed out everything can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.319" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">weaponized so emotions can be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.419" end="00:04:58.830" style="s2">and emotions emotions are very complex I</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">think in terms of like a principle or</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:02.159" style="s2">rule for inter relating emotions and on</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">instructions is really nice phrase</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.159" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">because the person I heard it from</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">described it as they&#39;re really important</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:09.419" style="s2">you can listen to your emotions you need</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:11.189" style="s2">to be absolutely connected with what</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.419" end="00:05:13.289" style="s2">they are you know have some objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.189" end="00:05:14.849" style="s2">of you know being able to say okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.289" end="00:05:17.460" style="s2">feeling angry I&#39;m feeling whatever it</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.460" end="00:05:20.969" style="s2">the sense of you don&#39;t have to then</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:23.939" style="s2">react to them and that&#39;s really a core</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.969" end="00:05:26.219" style="s2">tenant in in mindful self-awareness is</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.939" end="00:05:28.169" style="s2">that it comes up you observe it and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.219" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">you decide what to do that is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.169" end="00:05:32.430" style="s2">crucial that that&#39;s called decentering</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:34.169" style="s2">as part of D centering where I can take</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.430" end="00:05:36.599" style="s2">that step back that&#39;s crucial for</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.169" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">interpersonal dialogue because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.599" end="00:05:40.589" style="s2">emotion could be weaponized in pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">much every sentence it&#39;s like well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.589" end="00:05:44.069" style="s2">feeling like this and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:45.419" style="s2">acknowledging it and therefore I have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.069" end="00:05:47.789" style="s2">right to get angry at you or I&#39;ve right</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.419" end="00:05:49.430" style="s2">to do this I&#39;ve right to do that so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.789" end="00:05:52.469" style="s2">so that&#39;s a tenant I&#39;ve really been</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.430" end="00:05:55.979" style="s2">thinking of and realizing that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.469" end="00:05:58.050" style="s2">been quite core to to my own practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.979" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s big and stoicism as</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.050" end="00:06:01.710" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s a very important skill</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:03.180" style="s2">that we develop you but I want to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.710" end="00:06:05.819" style="s2">little bit about some of the exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.180" end="00:06:08.610" style="s2">even that rule can be weaponized like</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.819" end="00:06:10.680" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m aware in myself there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.610" end="00:06:12.599" style="s2">couple of times where I&#39;ve shared</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.680" end="00:06:14.669" style="s2">something with someone or I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.599" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">confrontation with someone and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.669" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">part of me that&#39;s like are great now I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:20.430" style="s2">can and how I can talk about that person</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:22.469" style="s2">to anyone and I can say this to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.430" end="00:06:24.569" style="s2">like there is a kind of like being</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.469" end="00:06:27.270" style="s2">really aware of how we&#39;re using that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.569" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">rule still has to come in so I can think</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.270" end="00:06:30.389" style="s2">of a couple of times where there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.680" end="00:06:32.219" style="s2">a sort of mischievous part of myself or</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.389" end="00:06:34.110" style="s2">kind of vindictive part of myself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.219" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">like right now I&#39;ve told that person now</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.110" end="00:06:38.909" style="s2">I can say whatever I want about them so</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">that&#39;s you you can&#39;t bypass any of those</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.909" end="00:06:43.770" style="s2">kind of weaponization with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">and there&#39;s also the danger of are you</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.770" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">sharing there&#39;s also kind of meta ruled</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:52.349" style="s2">all of this rests within is there has to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">be an understanding of when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.349" end="00:06:55.860" style="s2">sharing that information with someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:58.680" style="s2">are they going to use that information</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.860" end="00:07:01.199" style="s2">for the benefit of everyone involved so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.680" end="00:07:02.699" style="s2">we&#39;re part of various communities that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.199" end="00:07:04.740" style="s2">have done we did counseling training</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.699" end="00:07:06.210" style="s2">with groups of people we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.740" end="00:07:07.110" style="s2">these kind of relationships with people</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.210" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">where we&#39;re having these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.110" end="00:07:10.770" style="s2">conversations and we&#39;re asking for</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:13.020" style="s2">reflections from others about our kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.770" end="00:07:15.330" style="s2">of negative patterns and what we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.020" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">what they&#39;re observing and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.330" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">really useful and very oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:21.180" style="s2">growth they&#39;re really helpful to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:23.009" style="s2">those relationships but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:25.169" style="s2">sharing stuff about other people and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.009" end="00:07:27.030" style="s2">they haven&#39;t bought into like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.169" end="00:07:28.949" style="s2">still gone and maybe there&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.030" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">them it&#39;s motivated by resentment or</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.949" end="00:07:32.759" style="s2">vindictiveness or some kind of wanting</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.259" style="s2">to get one up on that other person there</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.759" end="00:07:35.669" style="s2">are certain people that&#39;s not safe to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.259" end="00:07:38.669" style="s2">have that kind of relationship with and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.669" end="00:07:40.830" style="s2">have it knowing where that is and can</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.669" end="00:07:41.969" style="s2">and the most sort of obvious examples</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.830" end="00:07:44.460" style="s2">are like the sort of what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.969" end="00:07:46.440" style="s2">the personality disorder spectrum where</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.460" end="00:07:48.030" style="s2">someone&#39;s got such a fragile sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.440" end="00:07:51.240" style="s2">self that they will kind of weaponize</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.030" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">and manipulate and and like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.240" end="00:07:56.460" style="s2">extreme but there&#39;s also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:59.909" style="s2">probably a cut-off point where what what</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.460" end="00:08:02.789" style="s2">differentiates healthy healthy feedback</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.909" end="00:08:04.469" style="s2">healthy gossip from unhealthy gossip</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.789" end="00:08:07.349" style="s2">there&#39;s a dividing line and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.469" end="00:08:10.139" style="s2">somewhere in the place of is that person</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.349" end="00:08:11.880" style="s2">trust able not to act out in that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.139" end="00:08:13.819" style="s2">yeah it is interesting as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.880" end="00:08:16.229" style="s2">what I&#39;m thinking of is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.819" end="00:08:19.590" style="s2">this idea that anything can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.229" end="00:08:22.759" style="s2">weaponized and also how often I see in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.590" end="00:08:25.560" style="s2">myself and in various communities how</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.759" end="00:08:27.630" style="s2">models are used to principles models</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.560" end="00:08:28.949" style="s2">rules of engagement even something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.630" end="00:08:32.370" style="s2">rule Omega whatever it might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.949" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">are used to bypass being human you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.370" end="00:08:36.300" style="s2">so these things all get tested on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:38.339" style="s2">battlefield so to speak they get tested</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:40.950" style="s2">in life and for me the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.339" end="00:08:42.750" style="s2">worth is salt is is our actions you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.950" end="00:08:44.670" style="s2">so it comes down to very human values of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.750" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2">you know what&#39;s how much integrity have</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.670" end="00:08:51.779" style="s2">I got how you know how honest am I how</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:53.160" style="s2">you know how open am I you know how can</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.779" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">I admit making a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.160" end="00:08:55.770" style="s2">etc and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:57.450" style="s2">so I always find it very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.770" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">see people under pressure or in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.450" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">challenge and that&#39;s how I test my own</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:04.350" style="s2">values it&#39;s like okay well how are you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:05.670" style="s2">when money&#39;s on the line you know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.350" end="00:09:06.360" style="s2">brings up a whole lot of shadows for</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.670" end="00:09:07.890" style="s2">people that&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.360" end="00:09:09.959" style="s2">and suddenly everything can fall out the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.890" end="00:09:11.730" style="s2">window all these lofty goals and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.959" end="00:09:13.500" style="s2">that&#39;s the bit where I think the real</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.730" end="00:09:15.870" style="s2">practice happens and I think that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.500" end="00:09:17.580" style="s2">know we&#39;ve talked about this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.870" end="00:09:18.779" style="s2">coherence of falling out of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.580" end="00:09:20.490" style="s2">I actually thinks when we fall out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.779" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">coherence that we learn the most in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.490" end="00:09:24.990" style="s2">lot of ways and so being able to come</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:27.390" style="s2">back into some kind of sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.990" end="00:09:28.649" style="s2">centrist and go oh I really lost my</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.390" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">there I wonder what that was about like</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.649" end="00:09:31.589" style="s2">that&#39;s the important thing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:33.209" style="s2">never losing our because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.589" end="00:09:34.860" style="s2">gonna happen and that&#39;s part of growth</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.209" end="00:09:36.779" style="s2">yeah and that reminds me of something</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:37.500" style="s2">daniel said I think in the first war on</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.779" end="00:09:40.830" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.500" end="00:09:43.410" style="s2">about he trusts people to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.830" end="00:09:45.060" style="s2">their worst behavior like knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:47.970" style="s2">assuming that everything goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.060" end="00:09:49.770" style="s2">pear-shaped what&#39;s the what how bad will</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.970" end="00:09:52.020" style="s2">you allow it to get how vindictive will</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.770" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">you allow yourself to be how and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.020" end="00:09:55.020" style="s2">a really interesting that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:57.570" style="s2">good frame I think to kind of look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.020" end="00:10:00.930" style="s2">this through so this has been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.570" end="00:10:02.130" style="s2">fun we should do more of these yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.930" end="00:10:03.570" style="s2">really interested to hear people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.130" end="00:10:06.420" style="s2">thoughts reflections on this</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.570" end="00:10:08.520" style="s2">particularly Daniel do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.420" end="00:10:11.910" style="s2">this is potentially workable as a rule</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.520" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">Delta and if not which seventeen things</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.910" end="00:10:18.899" style="s2">have we not taken into account cool it&#39;s</p>
