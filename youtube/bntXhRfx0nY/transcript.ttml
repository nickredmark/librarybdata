<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">something like this spark of the Divine</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">in the individual and that it has</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">something to do with a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:23.780" style="s2">I guess I&#39;m gonna do with the idea that</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">there&#39;s something that like the</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">individual yeah hence inalienable yes</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:29.010" style="s2">like with circling is making its in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:31.740" style="s2">reason why I&#39;m interested in this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.010" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s making more sense to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">me about why well I&#39;ve always wondered</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">what the hell is going on when people</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">have this experience of being with</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">somebody and they have the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">being seen or seen in this way it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:54.360" style="s2">almost like a religious experience like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like where people have an</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.360" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">experience of where something like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">human being is revealed in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:05.610" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about them that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">is so unique then it kind of glows and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.610" end="00:03:10.709" style="s2">people go into almost like a trance of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.360" style="s2">some kind right and are enriched and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.709" end="00:03:14.610" style="s2">they keep wanting to have that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.360" end="00:03:17.550" style="s2">experience and touch in on it not I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.610" end="00:03:19.320" style="s2">been wondering about like you know it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.550" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">because it feels something like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.320" end="00:03:24.890" style="s2">religious experience it definitely is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">something that people kind of act</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.890" end="00:03:33.510" style="s2">ritualistically about and want a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">and feel enriched from and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.510" end="00:03:39.860" style="s2">wondering if if that is if that is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:42.330" style="s2">experience of something like seeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.860" end="00:03:45.390" style="s2">something like the spark of the Divine</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.330" end="00:03:47.940" style="s2">in somebody and I&#39;ve always thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.390" end="00:03:50.459" style="s2">about that that there is there does seem</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.940" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">to be something that like you like is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.459" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">this way in which I can&#39;t there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a way which if I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">relating to you you&#39;ll always not live</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.850" end="00:04:02.459" style="s2">my conception of you right like you lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:05.299" style="s2">I&#39;ll never be able to like predict you</p>

<p begin="00:04:10.130" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">there&#39;s why we have a name right versus</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">of course of course if I don&#39;t count in</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:47.710" style="s2">points to something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.760" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">versus a description there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.710" end="00:04:53.050" style="s2">that&#39;s like you want a function that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:56.500" style="s2">aren&#39;t a means to an end in the in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.050" end="00:04:59.320" style="s2">fundamental way so I&#39;m like I wanted to</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.320" end="00:05:05.590" style="s2">notion of its connection with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.590" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">universal or something that like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.590" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">there&#39;s something that is can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:15.340" style="s2">completely mapped or conceptualized and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:17.610" style="s2">in how that&#39;s experienced and why that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.340" end="00:05:23.050" style="s2">matters and where that comes from and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.610" end="00:05:25.000" style="s2">then everything else yeehaw mm-hm do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.050" end="00:05:29.740" style="s2">want to go first or should I I think</p>

<p begin="00:05:29.740" end="00:05:37.110" style="s2">know if you remember I&#39;m fond of saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:37.110" style="s2">that reality is the ultimate other</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.850" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">reality is deeper than our conception of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:46.600" style="s2">it you know as I&#39;m fond of saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:49.330" style="s2">reality is infinitely deep in all</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.600" end="00:05:51.100" style="s2">dimensions and in all directions like no</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.330" end="00:05:52.660" style="s2">matter where you go in reality it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.100" end="00:05:55.540" style="s2">showing up though exactly the way that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.660" end="00:05:58.540" style="s2">it shows up yeah right and in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.540" end="00:06:03.060" style="s2">reality can&#39;t be any more the way that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.540" end="00:06:03.060" style="s2">it is than it already is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.450" end="00:06:11.350" style="s2">yeah right and it&#39;s infinitely deep and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.760" end="00:06:13.780" style="s2">it is the way that it is it can&#39;t be any</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.350" end="00:06:19.000" style="s2">more in that way reality is the one</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.780" end="00:06:20.890" style="s2">perfect thing this infinity that we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.000" end="00:06:25.540" style="s2">to experience and you know like I say</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.890" end="00:06:28.900" style="s2">what is this right ah it&#39;s a pen yes but</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:38.099" style="s2">dimensions is true</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.620" end="00:06:43.190" style="s2">mmm-hmm right but that&#39;s not all of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:45.500" style="s2">dimensions there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.190" end="00:06:48.140" style="s2">dimensions I can never know this thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.500" end="00:06:51.410" style="s2">fully yeah it will always outlive me and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.140" end="00:06:54.440" style="s2">that&#39;s true of a pen it&#39;s true of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.410" end="00:07:01.160" style="s2">electron but it&#39;s especially true of</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.160" end="00:07:08.660" style="s2">thing the more profound my recognition</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.490" end="00:07:10.640" style="s2">of it is to me yeah so when when you say</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.660" end="00:07:11.930" style="s2">that like you recognize the divine in</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.640" end="00:07:15.160" style="s2">someone else what do you mean the divine</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.160" end="00:07:25.100" style="s2">beautiful and recognizable and conscious</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.300" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">like you&#39;re actually with a human being</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.100" end="00:07:30.520" style="s2">you&#39;re recognizing another conscious</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:33.920" style="s2">being that has all of its own stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.520" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">well it has it has all of its own</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.920" end="00:07:37.970" style="s2">stories about what life is and what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:40.580" style="s2">pen is and what it what it is and what</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.150" end="00:07:58.660" style="s2">it to set a context and then I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.650" end="00:08:01.640" style="s2">give it back to you mm-hmm so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.660" end="00:08:03.790" style="s2">you can say first position which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.640" end="00:08:05.480" style="s2">where you see from your own perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.790" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">and this is a baby</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.480" end="00:08:09.380" style="s2">they only basically see their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.780" style="s2">perspective they don&#39;t recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.380" end="00:08:13.640" style="s2">there are other perspectives right</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.780" end="00:08:14.990" style="s2">remember you you take the ball and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.640" end="00:08:18.830" style="s2">red on one side and blue on the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.990" end="00:08:20.870" style="s2">side and you show them it&#39;s red it&#39;s red</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.830" end="00:08:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s blue and then you show them the red</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.870" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">side and you say what&#39;s what color are</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.250" end="00:08:25.790" style="s2">you seeing and they say red and you say</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">now what color am I seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.790" end="00:08:33.169" style="s2">and they say rent because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">know how to understand another</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.169" end="00:08:38.660" style="s2">perspective well they&#39;re locked in first</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:39.770" style="s2">position right but then when they grow</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.660" end="00:08:41.479" style="s2">they get to the point where they go oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.770" end="00:08:42.950" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing red therefore you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.479" end="00:08:44.150" style="s2">blue and if you turn the blue side</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.950" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">they&#39;ll say I&#39;m seeing blue and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.150" end="00:08:48.170" style="s2">seeing red because now they can</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:50.509" style="s2">understand perspective they can now do a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.170" end="00:08:56.029" style="s2">second position shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.509" end="00:09:00.600" style="s2">mmm-hmm great right right and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.029" end="00:09:03.750" style="s2">ability to see another person from their</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.600" end="00:09:05.810" style="s2">perspective gives you a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.750" end="00:09:09.269" style="s2">relation to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.810" end="00:09:11.160" style="s2">right right the self that you are when</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.269" end="00:09:12.449" style="s2">there&#39;s no other people is completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.160" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">different than the self that you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.449" end="00:09:18.410" style="s2">when there is another person yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:21.690" style="s2">is you know Sartre z&#39; idea of the gaze</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.410" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">yeah but to be seen by another who</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.690" end="00:09:29.569" style="s2">thinks and judges and who is conscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:34.680" style="s2">like you yeah has you see yourself new</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.569" end="00:09:38.220" style="s2">yeah right so when we see the divine in</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.680" end="00:09:41.970" style="s2">another we see them and in seeing them</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.220" end="00:09:44.009" style="s2">we see ourselves anew right now I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.970" end="00:09:45.529" style="s2">a little bit further yeah we can say</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.009" end="00:09:48.120" style="s2">that there&#39;s a third-person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.529" end="00:09:52.050" style="s2">and the third-person perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.120" end="00:09:56.670" style="s2">where you you observe the eye and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.050" end="00:09:58.230" style="s2">you yeah and you can abstract out well</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.670" end="00:09:59.459" style="s2">the you thinks this and the eye thinks</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.230" end="00:10:01.649" style="s2">this and this other person thinks this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.459" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">and the other person thinks this and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.649" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2">can build a map of all of the identities</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:09.569" style="s2">now that&#39;s deeper than just first and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.360" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">second position is it that&#39;s you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.569" end="00:10:15.630" style="s2">that&#39;s why scientists often feel such</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:17.759" style="s2">enormous love for the beauty of science</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.630" end="00:10:19.939" style="s2">and the beauty of mathematics and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.759" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">beauty of these things which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.939" end="00:10:23.819" style="s2">absolutely profound because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:28.470" style="s2">actually understanding the universe as</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.819" end="00:10:31.310" style="s2">other right totally and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.470" end="00:10:33.240" style="s2">say that there&#39;s a fourth person hey</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.310" end="00:10:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a fourth person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.240" end="00:10:41.730" style="s2">which is that you can see lots of third</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:43.529" style="s2">person perspectives and understand that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.730" end="00:10:48.060" style="s2">human beings even when they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.529" end="00:10:50.459" style="s2">objective bring all kinds of stories to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.060" end="00:10:53.819" style="s2">it you can say this is Heidegger yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.459" end="00:10:55.139" style="s2">that we&#39;re thrown into a perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.819" end="00:10:59.939" style="s2">that even when we think we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.139" end="00:11:01.559" style="s2">objective we&#39;re coming from a place and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.939" end="00:11:03.260" style="s2">therefore we can start to examine the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.559" end="00:11:05.810" style="s2">place that we&#39;re coming from forth</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.260" end="00:11:08.360" style="s2">position yeah right and we can can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.810" end="00:11:13.540" style="s2">can continue up that with each level of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.360" end="00:11:19.280" style="s2">depth right Boober comes from this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.540" end="00:11:23.210" style="s2">fourth position right where he&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.280" end="00:11:24.140" style="s2">his vow he&#39;s not just oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.210" end="00:11:29.000" style="s2">different than me</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.140" end="00:11:31.460" style="s2">right right it&#39;s and humans are</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.000" end="00:11:34.280" style="s2">different than one another and the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.460" end="00:11:37.280" style="s2">we see one another the stance we take</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.280" end="00:11:42.080" style="s2">towards one another opens up a new realm</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.280" end="00:11:44.780" style="s2">this realm of vow versus it versus you</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.080" end="00:11:49.190" style="s2">yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.780" end="00:11:51.710" style="s2">and this you it valve I&#39;m gonna call</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.190" end="00:11:54.890" style="s2">that fourth person perspective but it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.710" end="00:11:59.180" style="s2">a deeper divinity than just me and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.890" end="00:12:01.490" style="s2">yeah right so we&#39;ve got that now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.180" end="00:12:04.640" style="s2">gonna add one more thing Nathaniel</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.490" end="00:12:08.540" style="s2">Branden talks about the he used to call</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.640" end="00:12:12.380" style="s2">it the mutt Nick principle right because</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.540" end="00:12:16.040" style="s2">he had a dog named mutt Nick okay right</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.380" end="00:12:22.760" style="s2">and and he noticed that he would his dog</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.040" end="00:12:26.540" style="s2">would play with him the dog would take</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.760" end="00:12:31.370" style="s2">pleasure when they would pretend to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.540" end="00:12:34.550" style="s2">fight yes complex&#39; right that there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.370" end="00:12:35.980" style="s2">another consciousness over there and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.550" end="00:12:38.030" style="s2">was because the other consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.980" end="00:12:40.640" style="s2">recognizes that we are consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.030" end="00:12:43.550" style="s2">recognizes that we can play with one</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.640" end="00:12:45.380" style="s2">another it&#39;s that and he changed it from</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.550" end="00:12:49.220" style="s2">mutt Nick principle to psychological</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.380" end="00:12:53.270" style="s2">visibility I&#39;m visible in and I&#39;m seen</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.220" end="00:13:00.400" style="s2">by another right but not only am i</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.270" end="00:13:03.710" style="s2">seeing you but you were seeing me see</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.400" end="00:13:05.930" style="s2">right and that psychological visibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.710" end="00:13:11.530" style="s2">as we add levels of complexity becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.930" end="00:13:15.080" style="s2">increasingly mind blowing towards depth</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.530" end="00:13:16.940" style="s2">and that depth is divine and yes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.080" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">hungry for that because whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.940" end="00:13:23.480" style="s2">consciousness is it likes depth the fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">that depth is possible the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.480" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">beauty and love are possible is divine</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.620" end="00:13:38.660" style="s2">right and all of that is built on my</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.030" end="00:13:41.720" style="s2">capacity to see these multiple</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.660" end="00:13:45.590" style="s2">perspectives because if I can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.720" end="00:13:48.860" style="s2">you if I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.590" end="00:13:51.290" style="s2">be you then I won&#39;t feel that connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.860" end="00:13:54.260" style="s2">you know feel the intimacy of you and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.290" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">together I won&#39;t feel the intimacy of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.260" end="00:13:57.860" style="s2">as a relationship and what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:13:59.090" style="s2">we&#39;re creating together from an</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.860" end="00:14:00.670" style="s2">objective perspective from this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.090" end="00:14:04.030" style="s2">third-person perspective it&#39;s like wow</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.670" end="00:14:07.730" style="s2">right we&#39;re creating something beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.030" end="00:14:11.170" style="s2">right there&#39;s a we here it goes beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.730" end="00:14:16.760" style="s2">the I in the you write that then somehow</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.170" end="00:14:19.370" style="s2">somehow calls the eye even more into yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.760" end="00:14:21.170" style="s2">itself that&#39;s more it&#39;s more depth if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.370" end="00:14:22.730" style="s2">can&#39;t see that then I&#39;m not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.170" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be as divine it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.730" end="00:14:26.210" style="s2">gonna be as profound right and it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:31.310" style="s2">you get at least to this fourth</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.210" end="00:14:34.400" style="s2">perspective of the vow yeah yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.310" end="00:14:38.510" style="s2">that that I can be with you in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.400" end="00:14:41.000" style="s2">way in which we blossom together into</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.510" end="00:14:42.230" style="s2">this consciousness where we go deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.000" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">and deeper and my consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.230" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">facilitates your consciousness and your</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:48.440" style="s2">consciousness facilitates my</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:50.210" style="s2">consciousness and as long as we think I</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.440" end="00:14:51.650" style="s2">know what you&#39;re thinking you know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.210" end="00:14:53.660" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking and you know that I know</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.650" end="00:14:55.340" style="s2">that you know that I know that you what</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.660" end="00:14:56.870" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking like as long as that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.340" end="00:15:00.410" style="s2">going there it&#39;s like we just keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.870" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">expanding and when that brain s is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.410" end="00:15:05.990" style="s2">that&#39;s ecstasy yeah that&#39;s static yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:09.740" style="s2">okay got it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.990" end="00:15:11.240" style="s2">okay so so now all be quiet well cut a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.740" end="00:15:13.250" style="s2">couple of things like one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.240" end="00:15:16.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about is in tell me</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:20.120" style="s2">if I&#39;m it is accurate so I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.760" end="00:15:22.490" style="s2">about a lot of about this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.120" end="00:15:25.490" style="s2">kind of first-person present right then</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.490" end="00:15:27.650" style="s2">second person I jump over into you and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.490" end="00:15:30.649" style="s2">then third person which I could call</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.650" end="00:15:37.459" style="s2">maybe we or it right</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.649" end="00:15:41.720" style="s2">and then ad infinitum is I have a hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.459" end="00:15:46.430" style="s2">time Ahmet whenever I imagine say like</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.720" end="00:15:49.399" style="s2">seeing it from out of your eyes when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.430" end="00:15:54.860" style="s2">imagine it I imagine it as if it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.399" end="00:15:57.459" style="s2">eyes and I&#39;m looking at right and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.860" end="00:16:00.559" style="s2">same thing when I do it like with third</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.459" end="00:16:04.759" style="s2">person like third perceptual position</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.559" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">and when I do it to mine like I have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.759" end="00:16:09.319" style="s2">hard time like finding a way to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:11.959" style="s2">perspective than isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t bring in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.319" end="00:16:14.660" style="s2">the inheritance of the something similar</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.959" end="00:16:16.339" style="s2">to the first level of perception is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.660" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">is that accurate or is there a way that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.339" end="00:16:21.290" style="s2">I can actually perceive that isn&#39;t from</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:22.999" style="s2">like a lived experience like when I go</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.290" end="00:16:26.119" style="s2">for example if I take the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.999" end="00:16:30.170" style="s2">like the uber uber hits and I look down</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.119" end="00:16:33.949" style="s2">I&#39;m still kind of first-person position</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.170" end="00:16:38.360" style="s2">as the uber X or first-person position</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.949" end="00:16:43.850" style="s2">as you first-person position as me that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.360" end="00:16:46.459" style="s2">carry over one is that am I thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.850" end="00:16:50.300" style="s2">about that correctly am i imagining</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.459" end="00:16:52.249" style="s2">because I&#39;m imagining like yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.300" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">so let me bring in a couple more pieces</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.249" end="00:16:56.120" style="s2">just to distinguish two ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:16:57.019" style="s2">about that okay not the only two ways of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.120" end="00:16:58.939" style="s2">thinking about it but two ways of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.019" end="00:17:02.449" style="s2">thinking about because I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.939" end="00:17:05.089" style="s2">two ways yeah I think fundamentally yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.449" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">you were 100% correct you can never</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.089" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">escape that right there&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:15.409" style="s2">enlightenment this idea of non-duality</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">that somehow at some point you actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.409" end="00:17:19.970" style="s2">escape that that there is just</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:23.419" style="s2">consciousness that is not from a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.970" end="00:17:28.459" style="s2">perspective right now I&#39;ll say that in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.419" end="00:17:30.440" style="s2">Ken Wilbur&#39;s work right they came up</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.459" end="00:17:35.000" style="s2">they came up with the idea of unique</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.440" end="00:17:38.899" style="s2">self which is that let&#39;s say you go to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.000" end="00:17:43.370" style="s2">fully non-dual experience right and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.899" end="00:17:44.060" style="s2">mind is either silent or the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.370" end="00:17:46.340" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.060" end="00:17:49.310" style="s2">but it&#39;s just another bit of experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.340" end="00:17:51.860" style="s2">like everything else and eater you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.310" end="00:17:55.790" style="s2">say you&#39;re identified with the space in</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.860" end="00:17:59.210" style="s2">which it&#39;s happening or there is no I</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.790" end="00:18:01.160" style="s2">that is identified right and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.210" end="00:18:02.750" style="s2">you are the space in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.160" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">happening but you&#39;re not this you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.750" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">that you&#39;re not anything but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:08.990" style="s2">everything but there&#39;s no you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">something there&#39;s just everything yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.990" end="00:18:15.470" style="s2">okay so even if you&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:19.220" style="s2">experience you&#39;re experiencing it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.470" end="00:18:22.940" style="s2">through a human body right which is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.220" end="00:18:24.470" style="s2">time-space physical matter kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.940" end="00:18:26.750" style="s2">you&#39;re all and this is you could say</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.470" end="00:18:28.700" style="s2">it&#39;s our thing toku right okay you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.750" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">seeing it in time you&#39;re seeing it a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.700" end="00:18:35.960" style="s2">certain scale yeah you&#39;re seeing certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:37.820" style="s2">parts of the of the spectrum visual</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.960" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">auditory kinesthetic right so it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.820" end="00:18:44.390" style="s2">a limited elective and you can never</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:47.390" style="s2">escape that well well you can never</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.390" end="00:18:51.730" style="s2">escape them okay so that&#39;s one thing yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.390" end="00:18:55.460" style="s2">you can never escape that well and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.730" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">think when you first started talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.460" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">what it brought up for me is that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:03.500" style="s2">are levels of self mm-hmm like who do</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:06.620" style="s2">you understand yourself to be are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.500" end="00:19:10.870" style="s2">just me or are you me in relation to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.620" end="00:19:14.210" style="s2">right or am i me and relationship to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.870" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2">understood from a an a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.210" end="00:19:24.290" style="s2">perspective or is there some greater we</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:29.690" style="s2">that we create that we&#39;re exploring each</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.290" end="00:19:34.340" style="s2">other and you are thou and the more I</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.690" end="00:19:38.660" style="s2">understand you well the more what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.340" end="00:19:41.870" style="s2">think I am transforms right like I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.660" end="00:19:44.360" style="s2">I&#39;m this until I really go on your ride</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.870" end="00:19:48.110" style="s2">and the more I go on your ride the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.360" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">my eye transforms in that moment because</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.110" end="00:19:54.680" style="s2">I use your consciousness to bridge me</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">into a new reality a little perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.680" end="00:20:00.890" style="s2">and that transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">well yes while it&#39;s still locked in</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.890" end="00:20:06.620" style="s2">that&#39;s from my perspective and I still</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:08.030" style="s2">put my stories on it I have you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.620" end="00:20:13.640" style="s2">Wilbur again talks about peak</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.030" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">experiences p ee k vs PE a k oh well</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.640" end="00:20:17.090" style="s2">right well you have a peak experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:19.670" style="s2">where it&#39;s like you peek into experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.090" end="00:20:21.080" style="s2">you have an altered state of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.670" end="00:20:23.900" style="s2">consciousness where you discover</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:27.800" style="s2">something new and when you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.900" end="00:20:30.860" style="s2">having the experience it transcends who</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.800" end="00:20:32.750" style="s2">you thought you were and therefore all</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.860" end="00:20:35.690" style="s2">of the structures through which you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.750" end="00:20:38.150" style="s2">been understanding the world and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.690" end="00:20:42.680" style="s2">moment of transcendence is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.150" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">creation of a new level of self and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.680" end="00:20:47.300" style="s2">goes beyond yourself but you still bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.210" style="s2">yourself to it and he says that when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.300" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">come down from a peak experience you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.210" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">have to talk about it and articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:57.170" style="s2">through whatever structures you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:59.090" style="s2">totally so as you&#39;re having the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.170" end="00:21:01.250" style="s2">experience as soon as you start to name</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.090" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">it that naming process brings back in</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.250" end="00:21:05.690" style="s2">the that level of self that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:07.370" style="s2">escape yeah so on the one hand you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.690" end="00:21:09.890" style="s2">never escape that self but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.370" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">hand it&#39;s that very vow experience that</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.890" end="00:21:14.810" style="s2">creates an escape and that&#39;s not a full</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">escape but let&#39;s say an order of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.810" end="00:21:19.250" style="s2">magnitude escape and there&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:25.610" style="s2">number of orders of magnitude now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.250" end="00:21:28.700" style="s2">like like what is the thing what was on</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.610" end="00:21:31.040" style="s2">Nietzsche what Nietzsche it was in there</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.700" end="00:21:35.540" style="s2">was a word for what he called himself a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.040" end="00:21:37.100" style="s2">film philologist yes so he that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.540" end="00:21:38.780" style="s2">he got his degree and that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.100" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">taught he was a philologist he studied</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.780" end="00:21:43.100" style="s2">languages and the cultures that gave</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:45.980" style="s2">forth the language and how the language</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.380" end="00:22:10.370" style="s2">way that it was meant to be read by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.360" end="00:22:13.730" style="s2">author can I read it in the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.370" end="00:22:16.059" style="s2">right right like like in other words can</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.730" end="00:22:21.140" style="s2">I can I read it without my own brain and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.059" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">like my understanding was like that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.140" end="00:22:27.080" style="s2">that kind of like the idea or the goal</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:29.720" style="s2">of it and that and that at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.080" end="00:22:32.600" style="s2">point somebody went no you can&#39;t and</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.290" end="00:22:50.870" style="s2">not bad news that&#39;s actually the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.960" end="00:22:53.990" style="s2">history is made is like when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.870" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">go back and we read an old text we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.990" end="00:22:58.429" style="s2">diminish it because we can&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.880" end="00:23:01.460" style="s2">without a frame we bring our frame back</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.429" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">to it in a rich it and it&#39;s that for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.460" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">that a circle it&#39;s three making if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:14.600" style="s2">bring it so to further your point oh god</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:40.910" style="s2">but one of the things he said is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.059" end="00:23:47.240" style="s2">the text is just your opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.910" end="00:23:50.510" style="s2">riff right the value of the text is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.240" end="00:23:53.410" style="s2">the test right right if you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.510" end="00:23:57.050" style="s2">to find out what the text actually said</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.410" end="00:23:59.030" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re on a goose chase yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.050" end="00:24:01.250" style="s2">this is what you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.030" end="00:24:03.800" style="s2">hermeneutics is that is there there</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.250" end="00:24:05.300" style="s2">there yeah there might be there there</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.800" end="00:24:07.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s not really what people do</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.300" end="00:24:09.500" style="s2">what people really do is that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.160" end="00:24:12.700" style="s2">interpret the text and in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.500" end="00:24:15.830" style="s2">interpretation that create its</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.700" end="00:24:17.900" style="s2">interpretation is self-expression yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.830" end="00:24:22.670" style="s2">Internet iteration right and you own</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.900" end="00:24:24.679" style="s2">that yeah then interpreting texts is art</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.670" end="00:24:26.509" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you get to express</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.679" end="00:24:28.909" style="s2">yourself and so the thing is how can you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.509" end="00:24:30.889" style="s2">in text interpret a text or fully</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.909" end="00:24:34.879" style="s2">beautifully fun with fun and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.889" end="00:24:36.289" style="s2">entertainment okay now we could say</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.879" end="00:24:38.840" style="s2">Ghana Murr</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.289" end="00:24:43.129" style="s2">Wilbur says that there are an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.840" end="00:24:46.639" style="s2">number of interpretations of Hamlet but</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.129" end="00:24:49.249" style="s2">some are better than others right Hamlet</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.639" end="00:24:51.590" style="s2">is not about a family vacation in</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.249" end="00:24:53.929" style="s2">Yosemite right right this is Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.590" end="00:24:55.340" style="s2">Peterson says look there&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.929" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">number of ways that you can interpret</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.340" end="00:24:58.429" style="s2">the world but there&#39;s only a few that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">are actually useful that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.429" end="00:25:03.409" style="s2">survive a natural selection process</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:06.499" style="s2">yeah which involves other people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.409" end="00:25:10.730" style="s2">which involves other people and so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.499" end="00:25:13.850" style="s2">interpretation can be designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.730" end="00:25:15.889" style="s2">just artistic where you put all of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.850" end="00:25:18.769" style="s2">authority in the interpreter and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.889" end="00:25:20.179" style="s2">just use the text as a it&#39;s like a grist</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.769" end="00:25:22.129" style="s2">for the mill it&#39;s just oh I&#39;m gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.179" end="00:25:26.899" style="s2">these paints in order to paint my</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.129" end="00:25:31.059" style="s2">picture yeah or you can actually learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.899" end="00:25:33.259" style="s2">from the text yeah you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.059" end="00:25:35.029" style="s2">realities the ultimate other from</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.259" end="00:25:36.740" style="s2">another person in fourth person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.029" end="00:25:40.070" style="s2">perspective if you actually change</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.740" end="00:25:42.619" style="s2">yourself yeah you can read a text in</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.070" end="00:25:44.779" style="s2">order to change yourself rather than to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.619" end="00:25:47.090" style="s2">express yourself and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.779" end="00:25:49.100" style="s2">want to talk a little bit about like and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.090" end="00:25:50.869" style="s2">see if there&#39;s a connection here about</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.100" end="00:25:56.509" style="s2">the difference between when I read a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.869" end="00:25:59.809" style="s2">text and when I read you what is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.509" end="00:26:02.230" style="s2">difference like is there a difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.809" end="00:26:04.549" style="s2">like like what is my involvement in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.230" end="00:26:08.450" style="s2">listening to you and understanding you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.549" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">and in understanding of text so it kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.450" end="00:26:17.179" style="s2">of gets this way tuck in question okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:18.769" style="s2">good that is the question because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.179" end="00:26:22.100" style="s2">got this postmodern world dudes like</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.769" end="00:26:25.639" style="s2">Jordan Peterson is is dancing this dance</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.100" end="00:26:27.769" style="s2">of trying to create a post postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.639" end="00:26:29.240" style="s2">world like so you&#39;ve got post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.769" end="00:26:31.100" style="s2">but what do you create I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.240" end="00:26:35.330" style="s2">you&#39;ve studied anything on meta</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.100" end="00:26:37.070" style="s2">modernism met dad not explicitly okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.330" end="00:26:39.950" style="s2">there&#39;s this movement called meta</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.070" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">modernism mm-hmm right it&#39;s in art and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.950" end="00:26:43.460" style="s2">music and pop culture and things but</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:46.130" style="s2">it&#39;s also in philosophy there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.460" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">interesting thinkers in this space and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.130" end="00:26:50.090" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to do it integral has</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.889" style="s2">done so I&#39;m just gonna take an again use</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.090" end="00:26:55.580" style="s2">this as a go text so you&#39;ve got pre</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.889" end="00:26:57.080" style="s2">rational right this first-person</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.580" end="00:26:59.720" style="s2">perspective or the second person</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.080" end="00:27:02.210" style="s2">perspective where it&#39;s like okay well I</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.720" end="00:27:06.610" style="s2">want power read in the spiral dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.210" end="00:27:09.830" style="s2">ooh right first person or second person</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.610" end="00:27:11.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a goodness I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.830" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">go into a mythological thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.480" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">and I are related and this is blue or</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:19.549" style="s2">amber in the integral spiral all right</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:21.379" style="s2">and then there&#39;s third person where we</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.549" end="00:27:24.700" style="s2">can actually get objective about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.379" end="00:27:27.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s orange or the rational level</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.700" end="00:27:29.509" style="s2">right okay and then we can go fourth</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.860" end="00:27:31.220" style="s2">person perspective where we recognize</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.509" end="00:27:33.379" style="s2">that all the third person perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:34.879" style="s2">are still caught they think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.379" end="00:27:40.279" style="s2">objective but they&#39;re really not and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.879" end="00:27:45.289" style="s2">this is green or postmodern and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.279" end="00:27:47.539" style="s2">there&#39;s yellow or teal yellowing spiral</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.289" end="00:27:49.580" style="s2">dynamics teal and integral which is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.539" end="00:27:50.990" style="s2">integral level where you recognize all</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.580" end="00:27:52.129" style="s2">of those perspectives and you find</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.990" end="00:27:53.240" style="s2">what&#39;s right about all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.129" end="00:27:56.210" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong about all of them and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.240" end="00:27:57.769" style="s2">integrate them together right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.210" end="00:27:59.149" style="s2">what integral is you could say designed</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.769" end="00:28:01.789" style="s2">to do well there&#39;s another movement</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.149" end="00:28:05.590" style="s2">another take on it called meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.789" end="00:28:09.019" style="s2">oh and that&#39;s this question okay so</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.590" end="00:28:11.990" style="s2">because the text can be interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.019" end="00:28:13.429" style="s2">however you want and it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.990" end="00:28:16.190" style="s2">expression of self you could say in</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.429" end="00:28:17.059" style="s2">green you know any interpretation is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.190" end="00:28:18.919" style="s2">just power</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.059" end="00:28:20.779" style="s2">it&#39;s just self expression and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.919" end="00:28:23.419" style="s2">you tell one is better than the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.779" end="00:28:25.159" style="s2">well you can&#39;t it&#39;s all embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.419" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">power systems and this is Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.159" end="00:28:30.919" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s critique right all there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:33.490" style="s2">is power what we&#39;re we&#39;re as you say got</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.919" end="00:28:38.059" style="s2">immersed going no no no there are better</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.490" end="00:28:39.860" style="s2">interpretations mm-hmm right let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.059" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">to this meta modern perspective where we</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.860" end="00:28:46.850" style="s2">absolutely embrace the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:47.570" style="s2">insights yeah like we loved them right</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.850" end="00:28:50.919" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.570" end="00:28:53.739" style="s2">Jared on Foucault and Bart and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.919" end="00:28:57.129" style="s2">but a Baudrillard right these these</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.739" end="00:29:00.460" style="s2">thinkers who absolutely just tear apart</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.129" end="00:29:04.299" style="s2">this idea of a fixed third perspective</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.460" end="00:29:08.409" style="s2">right right let&#39;s embrace all of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.299" end="00:29:10.929" style="s2">and then let&#39;s recognize that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.409" end="00:29:12.789" style="s2">still a deeper truth yeah we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.929" end="00:29:14.859" style="s2">going back down to orange we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.789" end="00:29:17.049" style="s2">going back down to this scientific</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.859" end="00:29:20.100" style="s2">perspective but it is kind of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.049" end="00:29:26.230" style="s2">but it&#39;s also post scientific and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.100" end="00:29:28.029" style="s2">that frame when I&#39;m looking at you the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.230" end="00:29:32.289" style="s2">post modernists say all I ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.029" end="00:29:35.109" style="s2">experienced is a text all I ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.289" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">experienced is a text but you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.109" end="00:29:39.190" style="s2">no no there&#39;s something beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:41.769" style="s2">there&#39;s something there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.190" end="00:29:45.179" style="s2">different about reading a text and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.769" end="00:29:48.100" style="s2">interacting with a live human being I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.179" end="00:29:51.669" style="s2">wondering if there is so so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.100" end="00:29:53.590" style="s2">say yes there is and that looked and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.669" end="00:30:00.489" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s the distinction that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.590" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">make if you close your eyes and turn off</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.489" end="00:30:06.489" style="s2">the volume and all you have is your</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:08.609" style="s2">memory of me then I&#39;m just like a text</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.489" end="00:30:11.289" style="s2">yeah there you go</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.609" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">the thing is that I can surprise you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.289" end="00:30:17.320" style="s2">that&#39;s it and there the individual yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:19.590" style="s2">and to the degree that we&#39;re actually in</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.320" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">communication to the degree that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.590" end="00:30:26.529" style="s2">synced that our ideas and our frames are</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:30.429" style="s2">in sync with one another I can surprise</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.529" end="00:30:31.690" style="s2">you in ways that make sense tangential</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.429" end="00:30:33.399" style="s2">it&#39;s not like where the fuck did that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.690" end="00:30:36.220" style="s2">come from what what I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.399" end="00:30:40.419" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re saying you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.220" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">making sense no it&#39;s oh my gosh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.419" end="00:30:44.460" style="s2">surprising me in a way that I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:47.070" style="s2">actually understand it right that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.460" end="00:30:50.710" style="s2">transforms me and that can only happen</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.070" end="00:30:53.159" style="s2">like with another human being who can</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.710" end="00:30:57.399" style="s2">think the thoughts that you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.159" end="00:31:00.099" style="s2">yeah okay go on the ride of experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.399" end="00:31:01.419" style="s2">that you&#39;re going on right and laughing</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.099" end="00:31:03.789" style="s2">and I think that is different than a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.419" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">text and that&#39;s the magic of intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.789" end="00:31:07.460" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why we circle that&#39;s why we care</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.460" end="00:31:12.649" style="s2">about soul2soul connection from my</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:15.769" style="s2">perspective I mean that&#39;s the gold</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.649" end="00:31:18.470" style="s2">because that&#39;s transcendent where you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.769" end="00:31:22.220" style="s2">and I become deeper together right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.470" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">now my self exists in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.220" end="00:31:26.990" style="s2">because you see me and I see you seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.039" end="00:31:29.419" style="s2">me and I see you and you see me sink</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.990" end="00:31:32.629" style="s2">right that well it creates a new world</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.419" end="00:31:35.210" style="s2">together and it&#39;s ecstatic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.629" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">beautiful and when it gets lost yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.210" end="00:31:47.590" style="s2">that connection gets broken when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:56.090" style="s2">break up yeah right totally totally and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.590" end="00:31:57.860" style="s2">that so a couple of things look I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.090" end="00:32:00.620" style="s2">this is this is this has been my</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.860" end="00:32:03.289" style="s2">experience with why I&#39;ve always said</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.620" end="00:32:06.049" style="s2">that listening like really listening to</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.289" end="00:32:07.879" style="s2">another can be the most has been the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.049" end="00:32:11.690" style="s2">most transformative thing of in my life</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.879" end="00:32:14.899" style="s2">it&#39;s also been like reading like reading</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.690" end="00:32:16.700" style="s2">I think it&#39;s easier to talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.899" end="00:32:17.779" style="s2">well yeah it&#39;s less it&#39;s like cuz</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.700" end="00:32:19.820" style="s2">readings a little bit less dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.779" end="00:32:22.850" style="s2">precisely because what you&#39;re saying but</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.820" end="00:32:27.320" style="s2">there&#39;s also this way in which like when</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.850" end="00:32:28.370" style="s2">you read a text that is just beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.320" end="00:32:30.110" style="s2">comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.370" end="00:32:31.909" style="s2">right it&#39;s just like right over there</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.110" end="00:32:34.279" style="s2">right where you&#39;re constantly like in</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.909" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">order to understand what the author&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.279" end="00:32:40.940" style="s2">trying to do in order to think the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:43.809" style="s2">thought that the author wrote I have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.940" end="00:32:46.460" style="s2">step so far outside of my own</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.809" end="00:32:49.460" style="s2">presuppositions of understanding to then</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.460" end="00:32:52.639" style="s2">try to understand what he just said to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.460" end="00:32:57.289" style="s2">think that thought that whether or not I</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.639" end="00:32:59.450" style="s2">understand it or not isn&#39;t is um is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.289" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">the thing that like is necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.450" end="00:33:04.639" style="s2">transformative but it&#39;s what it took to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:08.809" style="s2">understand it right meaning meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.639" end="00:33:10.759" style="s2">like for example with reading Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.809" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">and Ponte and a lot of these guys which</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.759" end="00:33:15.169" style="s2">are just coming from a completely</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:18.740" style="s2">different a different set of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.169" end="00:33:21.590" style="s2">presuppositions I didn&#39;t remember read</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.740" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">over and over and over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.590" end="00:33:24.920" style="s2">and I knew that they were saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:28.970" style="s2">something that that I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.920" end="00:33:31.070" style="s2">comprehend but I knew but I knew I knew</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.970" end="00:33:33.860" style="s2">to keep reading and I and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.070" end="00:33:37.190" style="s2">what ended up happening for me was when</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.860" end="00:33:40.490" style="s2">I started to understand them what what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.190" end="00:33:42.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t notice until years later is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.490" end="00:33:44.600" style="s2">actually not only did I understand what</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.950" end="00:33:46.790" style="s2">did I start to understand what they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.600" end="00:33:48.770" style="s2">sick with what they were saying but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.790" end="00:33:51.800" style="s2">was able to start to see differently</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.770" end="00:33:53.780" style="s2">right I was able actually start the in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.800" end="00:33:56.900" style="s2">certain sense read the text of the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.780" end="00:33:58.940" style="s2">newly and this happen a lot was was</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.900" end="00:34:00.470" style="s2">circling like kind of reading Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.940" end="00:34:01.820" style="s2">and circling and reading Heidegger in</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.470" end="00:34:04.370" style="s2">circle and I didn&#39;t really even know</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.820" end="00:34:08.090" style="s2">what the connection was until I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.370" end="00:34:12.820" style="s2">learning what the connection was but</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.090" end="00:34:16.040" style="s2">this thing about like where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.820" end="00:34:19.730" style="s2">interested in this this this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.040" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">you know is it you know now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.730" end="00:34:22.130" style="s2">starting to get into that that thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:24.080" style="s2">about where you&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.130" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">you can say something to me right that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.080" end="00:34:29.750" style="s2">that it actually furthers my sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.480" end="00:34:32.360" style="s2">making right you can say something to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.750" end="00:34:34.630" style="s2">about me and my experience that makes</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.360" end="00:34:41.360" style="s2">more sense than what I could have said</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.630" end="00:34:43.340" style="s2">right one is if you were saying those</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.360" end="00:34:44.690" style="s2">things and I was in that moment thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.340" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">another thought I would have missed it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.690" end="00:34:51.470" style="s2">right but when I brought myself back and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.560" end="00:34:53.390" style="s2">I said say that again and then I what am</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.470" end="00:34:56.450" style="s2">I like you know what - you know what am</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.390" end="00:34:59.570" style="s2">I giving you such that what I have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.450" end="00:35:02.360" style="s2">think my own thought I stopped paying</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.570" end="00:35:05.540" style="s2">attention to you when I give you my</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.360" end="00:35:09.530" style="s2">awareness let&#39;s say or my attention is</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.540" end="00:35:11.930" style="s2">it are you thinking are like am i giving</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.530" end="00:35:15.140" style="s2">you over my thought stuff to think for</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.930" end="00:35:17.870" style="s2">me like are you thinking are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.140" end="00:35:23.090" style="s2">thinking my thought for me is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.870" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">what&#39;s happening you could say ideally</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.090" end="00:35:31.800" style="s2">yes right that&#39;s really like I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:33.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the case right if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.800" end="00:35:37.350" style="s2">I would have to say that&#39;s officially</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.630" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">really cool it&#39;s the most amazing thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.350" end="00:35:44.310" style="s2">ever right it is the greatest gift that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:48.270" style="s2">you can give another human being yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.310" end="00:35:52.470" style="s2">actually go on their ride to get them</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.270" end="00:35:55.350" style="s2">think for you to let them experience for</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.470" end="00:35:57.630" style="s2">you yes and to put all of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.350" end="00:36:00.420" style="s2">intelligence and consciousness and focus</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.630" end="00:36:04.140" style="s2">and for lack of a better term freewill</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.420" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">to focus your consciousness like Iran</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.140" end="00:36:09.990" style="s2">says the free will is not about choosing</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:12.030" style="s2">a versus B freewill is about focusing</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.990" end="00:36:14.820" style="s2">your consciousness okay we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.030" end="00:36:18.180" style="s2">intent to understand with the event to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.820" end="00:36:20.340" style="s2">go on the ride when the intent to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.180" end="00:36:23.400" style="s2">transcend into the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.340" end="00:36:28.440" style="s2">experience to understand that insight</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.400" end="00:36:31.170" style="s2">that yeah yes and our own mind can do</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.440" end="00:36:33.320" style="s2">that but when we when we give that kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.170" end="00:36:37.500" style="s2">of attention to another human being</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.320" end="00:36:41.790" style="s2">right I I say that love is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.500" end="00:36:44.520" style="s2">trade that&#39;s love all right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.790" end="00:36:48.510" style="s2">moment of love when you actually respect</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.520" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">someone and honor them so fully that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.510" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">go on their ride to really understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:55.020" style="s2">their ride not to understand it well</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.360" style="s2">enough so that you can then use it as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.020" end="00:37:01.800" style="s2">tool to accomplish what you want yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.360" end="00:37:03.630" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not bidding so it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.800" end="00:37:09.030" style="s2">that I may be actually someone different</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.630" end="00:37:11.630" style="s2">by the end of your sentence yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.030" end="00:37:14.820" style="s2">that&#39;s why you know love is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.630" end="00:37:19.290" style="s2">transformative force in that sense if</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.820" end="00:37:20.730" style="s2">you understand love as focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.290" end="00:37:22.740" style="s2">other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.730" end="00:37:26.280" style="s2">with reality being the ultimate other</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.740" end="00:37:32.130" style="s2">yeah and the self the experience of self</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.280" end="00:37:35.130" style="s2">and mind well being the ultimate source</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.130" end="00:37:37.560" style="s2">of reality not that reality is not out</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.130" end="00:37:41.250" style="s2">there but like your experience of it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.560" end="00:37:44.130" style="s2">right your fundamental experience right</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.250" end="00:37:45.600" style="s2">the other as part of reality as part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.130" end="00:37:48.330" style="s2">the self experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.600" end="00:37:50.610" style="s2">because you know we say what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.330" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">consciousness consciousness is God</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.610" end="00:37:55.380" style="s2">consciousness is divine what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:58.010" style="s2">consciousness consciousness is the eye</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.380" end="00:38:00.360" style="s2">that&#39;s experiencing the self that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.010" end="00:38:03.420" style="s2">understanding the self what is that self</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.360" end="00:38:05.640" style="s2">yeah that the eye is experiencing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.420" end="00:38:07.290" style="s2">the eye is like experiencing this thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.640" end="00:38:10.530" style="s2">called life and self from this</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.290" end="00:38:13.560" style="s2">particular perspective it are we open to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.530" end="00:38:15.420" style="s2">that yeah right meditation for me I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.560" end="00:38:16.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what meditation is it&#39;s to focus</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.420" end="00:38:19.320" style="s2">on your own</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.820" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">unfolding blossoming experience in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.320" end="00:38:22.580" style="s2">same way that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:25.350" style="s2">focusing on another human being right</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.580" end="00:38:27.780" style="s2">right totally so you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.350" end="00:38:31.260" style="s2">actually I thought I&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.780" end="00:38:33.150" style="s2">experience too of like you know in in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.260" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">certain sense I&#39;ve sometimes wondered</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.150" end="00:38:38.790" style="s2">about like how is it that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:43.890" style="s2">register a thought like do i register it</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.790" end="00:38:46.470" style="s2">like I do the perception of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.890" end="00:38:49.020" style="s2">picture do I see it like do I perceive a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.470" end="00:38:52.290" style="s2">thought almost like kind of analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.020" end="00:38:55.110" style="s2">what I see in the outside world or is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.290" end="00:38:58.140" style="s2">more alike do I perceive a thought like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.110" end="00:39:05.570" style="s2">the same way I perceive the immediacy of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.140" end="00:39:10.500" style="s2">the sensation in my foot great great now</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.570" end="00:39:12.900" style="s2">okay perhaps it is an artificial</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.500" end="00:39:15.000" style="s2">distinction right right based in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.900" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">biology that the wavelengths that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.000" end="00:39:20.220" style="s2">seeing through our eye is different than</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:24.600" style="s2">the kinesthetic sensations of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.220" end="00:39:29.300" style="s2">and movement and intensity and pain or</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.600" end="00:39:32.460" style="s2">not pain right that we get from our foot</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.300" end="00:39:34.410" style="s2">perhaps or a one way of looking at it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.460" end="00:39:36.540" style="s2">that the information we&#39;re getting when</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.410" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">we see that over there is of the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.540" end="00:39:40.440" style="s2">kind as the information that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">getting from our foot it&#39;s just in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.440" end="00:39:47.940" style="s2">different Channel totally totally and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:51.180" style="s2">yeah and in the same way perceiving our</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.940" end="00:39:55.530" style="s2">thoughts oh right right</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.180" end="00:39:58.140" style="s2">so when I got into NLP they talked about</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.530" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">five sensory systems visual auditory</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.140" end="00:40:01.980" style="s2">kinesthetic or</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:04.440" style="s2">three gustatory and they break down all</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.980" end="00:40:06.510" style="s2">of our experience into these things an</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.440" end="00:40:08.329" style="s2">auditory breaks into like things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.510" end="00:40:10.710" style="s2">you&#39;re hearing outside and then the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.329" end="00:40:13.559" style="s2">internal dialogue of you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.710" end="00:40:17.819" style="s2">yourself right right and what they said</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.559" end="00:40:20.730" style="s2">is that we we think that an experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.819" end="00:40:22.859" style="s2">is just in one of those categories or</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.730" end="00:40:25.020" style="s2">it&#39;s just in the auditory or it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.859" end="00:40:27.150" style="s2">internal dialogue but when we think a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.020" end="00:40:30.089" style="s2">thought and we&#39;re understanding it well</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.150" end="00:40:35.279" style="s2">yes we&#39;re visualizing yes we&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.089" end="00:40:38.369" style="s2">yes we&#39;re feeling and it has a taste and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.279" end="00:40:40.289" style="s2">a smell like the thoughts when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.369" end="00:40:44.730" style="s2">really on the ride of understanding a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.289" end="00:40:47.970" style="s2">thought it&#39;s a full human experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.730" end="00:40:49.799" style="s2">that we can isolate out the internal</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.970" end="00:40:51.420" style="s2">dialogue here are the words that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.799" end="00:40:53.369" style="s2">thinking and I can write down those</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.420" end="00:40:57.510" style="s2">words and that&#39;s why texts are useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.369" end="00:41:00.089" style="s2">yeah right but the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.510" end="00:41:03.329" style="s2">reading text and hearing someone say the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.089" end="00:41:05.910" style="s2">text area when you can hear all of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.329" end="00:41:09.900" style="s2">richness of the voice tone and the speed</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.910" end="00:41:12.390" style="s2">and experience itself as always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.900" end="00:41:15.150" style="s2">a deep profound thing including thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.390" end="00:41:17.730" style="s2">I think right this is what I got from</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.150" end="00:41:20.010" style="s2">yes is what I got from NLP and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.730" end="00:41:22.680" style="s2">why understanding another person going</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.010" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">on their ride doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.680" end="00:41:26.849" style="s2">just understanding their words yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:29.400" style="s2">you&#39;re reading a book and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.849" end="00:41:30.900" style="s2">they&#39;re talking a thought and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.400" end="00:41:32.520" style="s2">quite make sense you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.900" end="00:41:34.829" style="s2">reference for it you&#39;re kind of on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.520" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">ride but you kind of not yeah they&#39;re go</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.829" end="00:41:39.869" style="s2">they&#39;re traveling faster than you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:41.520" style="s2">follow yeah yeah right now sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.869" end="00:41:43.079" style="s2">when people do that in my experience I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.520" end="00:41:46.980" style="s2">gonna add to what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.079" end="00:41:49.020" style="s2">Oh sometimes when people do that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.980" end="00:41:50.339" style="s2">think that they&#39;re coherent I really</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.020" end="00:41:50.970" style="s2">don&#39;t think that they know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.339" end="00:41:54.900" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.970" end="00:41:59.099" style="s2">yeah yeah right and in which case I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.900" end="00:42:00.390" style="s2">less intrigued to actually try to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.099" end="00:42:01.740" style="s2">sense of what they&#39;re saying because I</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.390" end="00:42:04.289" style="s2">realized that I&#39;m gonna have to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.740" end="00:42:05.940" style="s2">sense of it that they there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.289" end="00:42:07.740" style="s2">there there they don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.940" end="00:42:10.950" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying right right but</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.740" end="00:42:12.599" style="s2">sometimes I get - Wow no no they&#39;re onto</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.950" end="00:42:13.400" style="s2">something they&#39;re describing something</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.599" end="00:42:17.480" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.400" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">profound deep coherent in some way and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.480" end="00:42:21.230" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it I need to go back</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:23.570" style="s2">over it I need to think the thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.230" end="00:42:25.850" style="s2">until I can build all of the reference</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.570" end="00:42:28.280" style="s2">experiences solid enough that I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.850" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">actually lay down in that experience and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.280" end="00:42:34.070" style="s2">feel it I need to be able to hear the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:35.840" style="s2">voice tone and differentiates the words</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.070" end="00:42:38.330" style="s2">so I can understand what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.840" end="00:42:40.730" style="s2">stressing and what yeah I need to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.330" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">able to visualize how the ideas come</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.730" end="00:42:49.100" style="s2">together I need to get the taste of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:50.540" style="s2">yeah oh I need and and when it&#39;s when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.100" end="00:42:53.810" style="s2">get the sense that someone&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.540" end="00:42:55.160" style="s2">something coherent and deep that if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.810" end="00:42:56.930" style="s2">understood it it would open up new</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.160" end="00:43:00.110" style="s2">worlds that gives us the incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.930" end="00:43:02.840" style="s2">actually work through it unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.110" end="00:43:03.530" style="s2">some authors in my experience they</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.840" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">really don&#39;t know what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.530" end="00:43:10.120" style="s2">and so when even when you try to follow</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:13.820" style="s2">them and you really work at it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.120" end="00:43:17.210" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah yeah ghetto like like I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.820" end="00:43:20.330" style="s2">loved Sartre I loved Sartre yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.210" end="00:43:21.680" style="s2">like he was he would drink I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.330" end="00:43:23.110" style="s2">if you know this about him when he when</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.680" end="00:43:25.250" style="s2">he would write his plays he would edit</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.110" end="00:43:26.540" style="s2">he would write the play and he would go</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.250" end="00:43:28.220" style="s2">back and he would edit when you write</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.540" end="00:43:29.840" style="s2">the play and go back and edit but he had</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.220" end="00:43:32.540" style="s2">a philosophy when he was doing when he</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.840" end="00:43:38.360" style="s2">was writing philosophical work he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.540" end="00:43:41.450" style="s2">edit hmm how come you know because he</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.360" end="00:43:45.050" style="s2">was on a roll yeah and that role was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.450" end="00:43:47.930" style="s2">unique role yeah hello challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.050" end="00:43:49.610" style="s2">those roles are so there you syncretic</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.930" end="00:43:52.310" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s not enough markers that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.610" end="00:43:54.050" style="s2">you can follow him yeah and sometimes he</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.310" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">says things that like a really profound</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.050" end="00:43:59.300" style="s2">and sometimes he says things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:44:02.810" style="s2">like like I personally let me take it</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.300" end="00:44:05.930" style="s2">out of the you to the I yeah I come</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.810" end="00:44:07.850" style="s2">across it and I go I could spend an hour</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.930" end="00:44:09.650" style="s2">trying to understand this and at best</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.850" end="00:44:12.950" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get an approximation cuz he</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.650" end="00:44:14.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t say it yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.950" end="00:44:20.120" style="s2">just Gliss</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.140" end="00:44:24.320" style="s2">the sizzle there&#39;s no steak yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.120" end="00:44:28.150" style="s2">all right so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re up for</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.320" end="00:44:31.810" style="s2">it I&#39;ll come back to this idea of God</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.150" end="00:44:36.890" style="s2">slowly well oh yeah you go</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.810" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">what so there&#39;s so there&#39;s this part</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.890" end="00:44:42.620" style="s2">about like Asha I really like the thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:46.520" style="s2">that you talked about like listening to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.620" end="00:44:51.320" style="s2">your when you meditate you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.520" end="00:44:54.740" style="s2">your experience as as like you give</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.320" end="00:45:00.410" style="s2">yourself to another&#39;s ride in which you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:45:02.900" style="s2">love right as a devotion to them as a as</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.410" end="00:45:07.460" style="s2">a testimony to your love for them but</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.900" end="00:45:11.060" style="s2">also as like a respect and what you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.460" end="00:45:14.330" style="s2">to get out of it that&#39;s a really great</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.060" end="00:45:15.830" style="s2">way of putting that about that sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.330" end="00:45:19.250" style="s2">because I often times when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.830" end="00:45:21.950" style="s2">meditating I would say there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.250" end="00:45:22.760" style="s2">like you know most of the time you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.950" end="00:45:24.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.760" end="00:45:27.140" style="s2">and I think that I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.980" end="00:45:29.900" style="s2">fact I&#39;m not sure but I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.140" end="00:45:33.530" style="s2">that we we actually I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.900" end="00:45:36.170" style="s2">don&#39;t see a thing that then I assigned a</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.170" end="00:45:42.500" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying it&#39;s like because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.850" end="00:45:44.540" style="s2">like my perception is already evidence</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.500" end="00:45:46.970" style="s2">of itself it&#39;s already an evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.540" end="00:45:49.640" style="s2">right the reason I&#39;m looking anywhere is</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.970" end="00:45:52.100" style="s2">because there&#39;s some ideal or a value or</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.640" end="00:45:55.580" style="s2">a meaning that&#39;s calling it forward and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.100" end="00:45:58.040" style="s2">so things arise in terms of that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.580" end="00:46:05.750" style="s2">when I meditate it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:18.440" end="00:46:25.400" style="s2">order to read the text on the page I</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.050" end="00:46:28.460" style="s2">need to transcend the shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.400" end="00:46:30.410" style="s2">letter right like I don&#39;t read I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.600" end="00:46:35.750" style="s2">transcend the shape of the letter and</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.310" end="00:46:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s only when I don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.750" end="00:46:38.780" style="s2">that then all of a sudden the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.040" end="00:46:40.180" style="s2">the letter I actually have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.780" end="00:46:42.110" style="s2">the shape of the letter</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.180" end="00:46:43.790" style="s2">if there&#39;s something about when you</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.110" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">meditate that in a certain way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.790" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">almost like you&#39;re trying to suspend</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:51.050" style="s2">reading right in a certain sense for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:54.020" style="s2">different kind of reading where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.050" end="00:46:56.600" style="s2">actually trying to like not get lost in</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.020" end="00:46:59.420" style="s2">the content of thinking but then notice</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.600" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">the most like the quality of thinking or</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.420" end="00:47:04.670" style="s2">the quality of sensing or the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.470" style="s2">these things without having to read them</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.670" end="00:47:09.500" style="s2">which i think is a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.470" end="00:47:12.470" style="s2">reading I think it I think I still think</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.500" end="00:47:15.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a reading I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.470" end="00:47:18.620" style="s2">an observing when I&#39;ve been getting from</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.710" end="00:47:22.760" style="s2">it is it&#39;s interesting that you put it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.620" end="00:47:25.070" style="s2">this way because there as I sit there</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.760" end="00:47:26.450" style="s2">and I just keep I keep witnessing my</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.070" end="00:47:28.760" style="s2">experience I keep giving my attention</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.450" end="00:47:31.100" style="s2">over to it I keep bringing myself back</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.760" end="00:47:35.960" style="s2">there is this quality at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.100" end="00:47:38.690" style="s2">moment where it does I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.960" end="00:47:40.610" style="s2">put it something gets some a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.690" end="00:47:44.420" style="s2">does come through that&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.610" end="00:47:46.940" style="s2">there&#39;s the source from which arising</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.420" end="00:47:53.300" style="s2">happens at all like that arising happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.940" end="00:47:56.750" style="s2">at all is it is it&#39;s a is it is a wonder</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.300" end="00:47:59.270" style="s2">that can&#39;t be exhausted right like</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.750" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">that&#39;s now that&#39;s what I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.270" end="00:48:06.050" style="s2">interesting like that I have to agree</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.630" style="s2">with you sorry</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.050" end="00:48:10.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like but on one level what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.630" end="00:48:12.860" style="s2">talking about the most ordinary thing in</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.820" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">the world the simple fact of our being</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.860" end="00:48:16.670" style="s2">there right like the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:17.810" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever experienced I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.670" end="00:48:19.820" style="s2">experienced the only thing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.810" end="00:48:21.890" style="s2">everything everything references or</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.820" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">presupposes the only thing has ever gone</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.890" end="00:48:29.690" style="s2">on is our being there like it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:32.030" style="s2">ordinary thing in the world and I can</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.690" end="00:48:34.700" style="s2">explain I mean we can explain our being</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.030" end="00:48:36.260" style="s2">there we can in fact we can explain it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.700" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">down to the T we could probably even</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.260" end="00:48:42.370" style="s2">like explain how it is that we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:45.770" style="s2">it there in terms of neuro firings and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.370" end="00:48:48.290" style="s2">we will be able to like ad infinitum but</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.770" end="00:48:52.100" style="s2">that there&#39;s any that there&#39;s our there</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.290" end="00:48:52.410" style="s2">there at all can&#39;t be exhausted like</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.100" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.410" end="00:48:58.049" style="s2">that&#39;s a wonder that can&#39;t be exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:59.910" style="s2">like you can&#39;t get you can&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.049" end="00:49:02.279" style="s2">that away there&#39;s something untouchable</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.910" end="00:49:06.869" style="s2">about that that I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.279" end="00:49:09.690" style="s2">oftentimes is I think why is the gift</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.869" end="00:49:15.329" style="s2">that keeps giving from medicine that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.690" end="00:49:18.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get old that&#39;s that&#39;s what when</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.329" end="00:49:20.039" style="s2">I when you talked about reading when you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.210" end="00:49:21.809" style="s2">talked about meditating as in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.039" end="00:49:23.849" style="s2">sense give it&#39;s really beautiful that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.809" end="00:49:26.130" style="s2">a really great way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.849" end="00:49:28.410" style="s2">like I&#39;m giving when I meditate I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.130" end="00:49:31.740" style="s2">giving myself over</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.410" end="00:49:36.930" style="s2">I&#39;m listening to my experience the way I</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.740" end="00:49:40.829" style="s2">would listen to somebody I was in love</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.930" end="00:49:42.660" style="s2">with their deeply loved there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.829" end="00:49:44.970" style="s2">communication that comes through that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.660" end="00:49:50.430" style="s2">something like it says is I says I am</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.970" end="00:49:52.680" style="s2">like it did like it says am and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.430" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">there is that there it but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.680" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">question okay and this is where I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">will we start to get into this okay I</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.809" end="00:50:13.049" style="s2">don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.509" end="00:50:19.160" style="s2">experience that can get old and I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.049" end="00:50:25.130" style="s2">that I&#39;m wondering if how this brings in</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.160" end="00:50:32.339" style="s2">how this connects into the individuality</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.130" end="00:50:34.740" style="s2">existence and value like the locus is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.339" end="00:50:38.849" style="s2">possible like the locus of our value is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.740" end="00:50:41.609" style="s2">in that it&#39;s like it&#39;s not that work</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.849" end="00:50:49.940" style="s2">it&#39;s not that work that I am and then I</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.609" end="00:50:52.170" style="s2">value that I am a value there there is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.940" end="00:50:56.099" style="s2">that looks like you&#39;re getting another</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.170" end="00:50:59.250" style="s2">call because you&#39;re frozen what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.750" end="00:51:45.850" style="s2">it fits in your existing categories yeah</p>

<p begin="00:51:51.490" end="00:51:55.390" style="s2">sense of transcendence where the we</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:57.160" style="s2">actually allow the text we read the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.390" end="00:52:00.880" style="s2">world we read ourselves we read another</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.160" end="00:52:01.620" style="s2">person with the intention to go on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.880" end="00:52:07.600" style="s2">ride</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.110" end="00:52:29.950" style="s2">categories and then they fight for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.670" end="00:52:33.370" style="s2">categories and then it gets old yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.950" end="00:52:36.130" style="s2">because now it now you&#39;re trying to put</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:26.350" style="s2">everything up and in that sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.440" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">completely unconcealed but in it Sun</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.350" end="00:53:32.950" style="s2">concealment it conceals right and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:34.810" style="s2">that is either them at wonderment like</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.950" end="00:53:36.120" style="s2">you can&#39;t like that&#39;s like I think I</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.810" end="00:53:38.260" style="s2">think that starts to get at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.120" end="00:53:44.350" style="s2">fundamental wonderment right it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.260" end="00:53:45.580" style="s2">wonderment or hell and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.350" end="00:53:48.220" style="s2">difference that makes that difference</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.580" end="00:53:50.950" style="s2">whether or not I open to it or whether I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.220" end="00:53:52.750" style="s2">close to it yeah right and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.950" end="00:53:55.480" style="s2">the the the major challenge of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.750" end="00:53:57.880" style="s2">existentialists and why they experience</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.480" end="00:54:01.870" style="s2">dread is they look at the insanity of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.880" end="00:54:04.810" style="s2">our lives the tenuous chaotic nature of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.870" end="00:54:07.810" style="s2">human consciousness and the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.810" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">possibility that what we see is possible</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.810" end="00:54:12.310" style="s2">in terms of love and joy and happiness</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:16.630" style="s2">and kindness and intimacy and beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.310" end="00:54:18.760" style="s2">then we see the the actual forms that</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.630" end="00:54:21.100" style="s2">exist around us in all the lower levels</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.760" end="00:54:22.720" style="s2">and we look at that and we say as you</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.100" end="00:54:24.970" style="s2">and I always say it&#39;s like okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.720" end="00:54:28.260" style="s2">reality infinitely deep in all</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.970" end="00:54:30.970" style="s2">directions perfect in its completeness</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.260" end="00:54:32.410" style="s2">it is exactly what it is it can&#39;t be any</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.970" end="00:54:34.030" style="s2">more the way that it is and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.410" end="00:54:37.510" style="s2">got our vision of how we think it should</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.030" end="00:54:41.380" style="s2">be and when those two are out of sync we</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.510" end="00:54:44.830" style="s2">make reality wrong totally we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.380" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">that little tiny story which is so paper</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.830" end="00:54:48.940" style="s2">thin compared to the depth of reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:53.380" style="s2">but when reality shows itself when it</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.940" end="00:54:54.850" style="s2">exposes our vision as inadequate yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.380" end="00:54:56.980" style="s2">make reality wrong because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.850" end="00:54:59.290" style="s2">violating our vision and that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.980" end="00:55:01.590" style="s2">would call it over standing that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.290" end="00:55:04.300" style="s2">I would call over standing right and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.590" end="00:55:06.730" style="s2">understanding is when you allow reality</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.300" end="00:55:10.780" style="s2">to expand your perception and that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.730" end="00:55:14.770" style="s2">wonderment that and and and also I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.780" end="00:55:19.570" style="s2">say one like that fundamentally well you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.770" end="00:55:22.360" style="s2">can you can approach experience open to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.570" end="00:55:26.740" style="s2">find its magnificent beauty and profound</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.360" end="00:55:28.810" style="s2">depth right you can worship God you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.740" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">put your attention on God you think of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.810" end="00:55:32.790" style="s2">real care</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:36.609" style="s2">rumi etc it&#39;s like they&#39;re like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.790" end="00:55:39.609" style="s2">god how beautiful the effulgence of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.609" end="00:55:41.770" style="s2">unknown moment is and going on that ride</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.609" end="00:55:45.910" style="s2">when I abandoned myself to it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.770" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">absolutely ecstatic yeah or I can look</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.910" end="00:55:50.530" style="s2">at what is and I can find everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:54.760" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be the way that it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.530" end="00:55:59.170" style="s2">yeah and that fundamental choice yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.760" end="00:56:01.390" style="s2">that unda mental choice right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.170" end="00:56:04.540" style="s2">where I think the game is I call that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.390" end="00:56:07.780" style="s2">the game of thriving it&#39;s using that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.540" end="00:56:10.630" style="s2">it&#39;s choosing to find beauty not to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.780" end="00:56:12.849" style="s2">constrain your beauty onto the world but</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.630" end="00:56:15.760" style="s2">to allow the world to expand your</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.849" end="00:56:17.980" style="s2">experience of beauty and they need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.760" end="00:56:19.869" style="s2">enact that so that you build structures</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.980" end="00:56:21.190" style="s2">that allow you to go deeper so that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.869" end="00:56:24.010" style="s2">can build structures that allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.190" end="00:56:28.930" style="s2">go deeper and to enjoy that ride so its</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.010" end="00:56:33.190" style="s2">prosperity you&#39;re building its purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.930" end="00:56:36.910" style="s2">its depth and its beauty and wonderment</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.190" end="00:56:39.579" style="s2">and ecstasy totally right and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.910" end="00:56:41.650" style="s2">choice that&#39;s the fun like what is free</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.579" end="00:56:42.970" style="s2">will free will is the choice to either</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.650" end="00:56:49.329" style="s2">steer in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.970" end="00:56:51.849" style="s2">or to make existence yeah because we</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.329" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">make it wrong you get a self that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.849" end="00:56:56.589" style="s2">self righteous and good right I call</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:58.900" style="s2">this the streetlamp life it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.589" end="00:57:01.630" style="s2">are trying to make this self good and</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.900" end="00:57:03.819" style="s2">you&#39;re in you&#39;re in the trial well I can</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.630" end="00:57:05.290" style="s2">only make enough things wrong then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.819" end="00:57:09.640" style="s2">be good enough right I&#39;ll be lovable</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.290" end="00:57:12.280" style="s2">I&#39;ll I&#39;ll be worthy yeah and if only I</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.640" end="00:57:14.859" style="s2">can build enough if I can only build</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.280" end="00:57:18.460" style="s2">enough then I&#39;m good enough right a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.859" end="00:57:20.950" style="s2">of this see let&#39;s do it allow the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.460" end="00:57:22.720" style="s2">to show us new things and then we jump</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.950" end="00:57:24.430" style="s2">on that we expand and then we go to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.720" end="00:57:27.099" style="s2">next level and expand and go to the next</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.430" end="00:57:29.260" style="s2">level and expand like a game often times</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.099" end="00:57:32.260" style="s2">I think part of its showing involves</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.260" end="00:57:34.210" style="s2">suffering right like it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.260" end="00:57:36.220" style="s2">inevitable thing about this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.210" end="00:57:38.530" style="s2">what I&#39;m beginning a lot about by the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.220" end="00:57:41.619" style="s2">way dude Jacob&#39;s Ladder</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.530" end="00:57:43.119" style="s2">did you write did you watch that episode</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.619" end="00:57:48.190" style="s2">a couple times yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.119" end="00:57:50.769" style="s2">yes yes I did that one that one&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.190" end="00:57:53.049" style="s2">high up there like I I have to say that</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.769" end="00:57:55.180" style="s2">one was he was he was hitting it on a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.049" end="00:57:58.299" style="s2">level that was intense</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.180" end="00:58:01.119" style="s2">well the way that he extrapolated the</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.299" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">notion of young I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.119" end="00:58:09.670" style="s2">this like what like one of your main</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:16.809" style="s2">ideas like this notion of the self being</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.670" end="00:58:19.089" style="s2">a four-dimensional thing where then that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.809" end="00:58:21.400" style="s2">something like you know you know as you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.089" end="00:58:24.069" style="s2">as you talks about I&#39;m reading Aeons</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.400" end="00:58:27.930" style="s2">again his book Aeons which is really</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.069" end="00:58:30.579" style="s2">kind of going in in it it&#39;s really he is</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.930" end="00:58:32.680" style="s2">youngest there&#39;s a there&#39;s a coherence</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.579" end="00:58:35.319" style="s2">there which is very attractive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.680" end="00:58:36.779" style="s2">very difficult to follow totally it</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.319" end="00:58:39.009" style="s2">what&#39;s circle yeah it&#39;s circle</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.779" end="00:58:40.359" style="s2">circumambulating it like and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.009" end="00:58:42.369" style="s2">thing I think I&#39;ve always liked about</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.359" end="00:58:44.170" style="s2">you is that you circle around something</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.369" end="00:58:46.599" style="s2">you circle around something it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.170" end="00:58:50.049" style="s2">like you sound like you necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.599" end="00:58:52.299" style="s2">knows Lucky&#39;s circling around exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.049" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">but it kind of emerges it&#39;s it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.299" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">the ride but um but this kind of notion</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:59:03.099" style="s2">that there&#39;s I I think I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:04.980" style="s2">been more impressed by this I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.099" end="00:59:07.569" style="s2">more impressed by this and in it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.980" end="00:59:12.099" style="s2">especially since I look at people this</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.569" end="00:59:13.869" style="s2">way through this frame it keeps being</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.099" end="00:59:17.079" style="s2">true which is like we&#39;re always up to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.869" end="00:59:19.509" style="s2">something and like that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.079" end="00:59:21.819" style="s2">don&#39;t exactly know exactly what that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.509" end="00:59:22.059" style="s2">if you ask if I ask you what you&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.819" end="00:59:23.140" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.059" end="00:59:26.769" style="s2">well it&#39;s a couple days here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.140" end="00:59:29.349" style="s2">question alright oh I&#39;ve been playing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.769" end="00:59:32.410" style="s2">with it like this if I ask myself what</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.349" end="00:59:33.880" style="s2">I&#39;m up to you I&#39;ll probably give you an</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.410" end="00:59:36.369" style="s2">answer I&#39;ll probably give myself an</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.880" end="00:59:38.980" style="s2">answer that is somewhat satisfying right</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.369" end="00:59:41.319" style="s2">and it&#39;ll make sense to me and I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.980" end="00:59:42.819" style="s2">able to explain it to you but I can</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.319" end="00:59:48.999" style="s2">point to the same thing in this I can</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.819" end="00:59:51.220" style="s2">say well what is it up to and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.999" end="00:59:53.650" style="s2">and I can look at the same places and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.220" end="00:59:57.370" style="s2">can ask myself what what is it up to and</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.650" end="01:00:00.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a different thing it&#39;s but into me</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.370" end="01:00:02.530" style="s2">that is that kind of discloses something</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.910" end="01:00:04.450" style="s2">else that&#39;s going on which is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.530" end="01:00:07.810" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve just been I&#39;m fucking</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.450" end="01:00:09.580" style="s2">really fascinated by that as an</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.810" end="01:00:12.460" style="s2">individual there&#39;s this kind of notion</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.580" end="01:00:14.800" style="s2">of like I am my own master I am master</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.460" end="01:00:17.320" style="s2">of myself right I make choices and they</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.800" end="01:00:20.890" style="s2">make decisions and I all these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.320" end="01:00:23.080" style="s2">things but like I&#39;m oftentimes the last</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.890" end="01:00:25.990" style="s2">person to tell you what the hell enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.080" end="01:00:29.170" style="s2">to I can find out five years down the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.990" end="01:00:31.270" style="s2">road what I&#39;ve been up to so this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.170" end="01:00:34.120" style="s2">quality of I and there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.270" end="01:00:36.340" style="s2">quality of it and I think that it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.120" end="01:00:39.270" style="s2">starts to get at something like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.340" end="01:00:42.790" style="s2">transcendent thing pulling us forward</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.270" end="01:00:45.850" style="s2">that has this field guilty right</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.790" end="01:00:50.590" style="s2">it speaks to us in our conscious it has</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.850" end="01:00:53.080" style="s2">this it beckons our attention um but</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.590" end="01:00:55.210" style="s2">there but but I like the thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.080" end="01:00:56.980" style="s2">own talks about that there&#39;s this that</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.210" end="01:00:59.560" style="s2">that where he draws the parallel between</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.980" end="01:01:02.530" style="s2">you know like the religious idea of</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.560" end="01:01:05.250" style="s2">Christ worshiping Christ and the notion</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.530" end="01:01:07.780" style="s2">of my future are almost exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.250" end="01:01:10.900" style="s2">right that there is this kind of sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.780" end="01:01:14.500" style="s2">that if I were realized in my full</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.900" end="01:01:17.050" style="s2">potential like the ideal there&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.500" end="01:01:20.500" style="s2">be an idea like that that like hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.050" end="01:01:22.990" style="s2">that makes it worth it right do anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.500" end="01:01:26.320" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about it is like</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.990" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">when you look around and you just I</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.320" end="01:01:29.890" style="s2">sometimes do this well just like look or</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:34.060" style="s2">on our nose we&#39;ll watch people just</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.890" end="01:01:36.340" style="s2">walking around and Cole what what are</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.060" end="01:01:39.070" style="s2">you doing like we&#39;re all going somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.340" end="01:01:42.820" style="s2">we&#39;re all like we have streets and like</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.070" end="01:01:45.490" style="s2">with road signs and today we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.820" end="01:01:51.600" style="s2">going somewhere everything&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.490" end="01:01:53.830" style="s2">somewhere and it seems to me that that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.600" end="01:01:58.540" style="s2">one of the things that I think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.830" end="01:02:00.310" style="s2">happens when somebody&#39;s seen is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.540" end="01:02:03.250" style="s2">kind of like I&#39;ve noticed that like it</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.310" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">seems like when somebody oftentimes when</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.250" end="01:02:07.060" style="s2">somebody has the experience of being</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:11.020" style="s2">deeply understood or deeply seen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.060" end="01:02:13.240" style="s2">when somehow in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.020" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">what they&#39;re up to in a way that they</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.240" end="01:02:19.300" style="s2">can&#39;t ever put words to what their whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:21.490" style="s2">life has been about is somehow spoken or</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.300" end="01:02:25.210" style="s2">defined or seen and that shines through</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.490" end="01:02:27.010" style="s2">like why they do everything even why</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.210" end="01:02:28.900" style="s2">they&#39;re sick and twisted the way that</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.010" end="01:02:31.300" style="s2">they&#39;re sick and twisted is all oriented</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.900" end="01:02:36.760" style="s2">in this direction that&#39;s uniquely them</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.300" end="01:02:44.230" style="s2">in calling them forward that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.760" end="01:02:50.080" style="s2">big enough that&#39;s beautiful yeah what is</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.230" end="01:02:54.250" style="s2">this self you know I I sometimes say</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.080" end="01:02:58.150" style="s2">that the I yeah is telling the story of</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.250" end="01:03:00.640" style="s2">the self yeah hmm you think using the</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.150" end="01:03:04.210" style="s2">mind the eye uses the mind to tell the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.640" end="01:03:10.810" style="s2">story of the self and myself is part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.210" end="01:03:13.240" style="s2">a world right right and yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.810" end="01:03:14.650" style="s2">the self that we think that we are the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.240" end="01:03:16.060" style="s2">story that we tell ourselves if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.650" end="01:03:17.320" style="s2">would ask me what it is I&#39;m up to I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.060" end="01:03:19.120" style="s2">tell you a story and it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.320" end="01:03:20.860" style="s2">reasonable story and it would satisfy</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.120" end="01:03:23.650" style="s2">some of the criterias about what I&#39;m up</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.860" end="01:03:24.430" style="s2">to but what am I really I&#39;m so much</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.650" end="01:03:26.260" style="s2">deeper than that</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.430" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">like I there are so many more dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.260" end="01:03:33.340" style="s2">to the self that I am yeah and the it</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:37.600" style="s2">that I am that yeah beyond my current</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.340" end="01:03:39.490" style="s2">story yeah and whenever I get new</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.600" end="01:03:48.460" style="s2">insight into myself whether it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.490" end="01:03:51.580" style="s2">I&#39;m circling and someone tells me and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.460" end="01:03:55.930" style="s2">now I get a deeper or an alternate or a</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.580" end="01:03:57.070" style="s2">complementary or a further refinement of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.930" end="01:04:01.570" style="s2">my story</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.070" end="01:04:03.460" style="s2">well I or whether I&#39;m reading a book or</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.570" end="01:04:04.600" style="s2">I&#39;m having a conversation and I see you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.460" end="01:04:07.150" style="s2">I mean this is the other part of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.600" end="01:04:09.610" style="s2">circling it&#39;s like I see you and in</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.150" end="01:04:11.080" style="s2">seeing you like I&#39;m a participant in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.610" end="01:04:15.700" style="s2">circle and I&#39;m watching you get circled</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.080" end="01:04:18.820" style="s2">and you go Paul and I go right I get a</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.700" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">new understanding of myself of the self</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.820" end="01:04:24.740" style="s2">the it that goes beyond my story well</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:28.520" style="s2">that I am right</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.740" end="01:04:30.950" style="s2">right that&#39;s that transcendence and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.520" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">again I I think that&#39;s an infinitely</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.950" end="01:04:37.190" style="s2">blossom never gets old kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:41.060" style="s2">it going somewhere is there a future</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.190" end="01:04:43.220" style="s2">self a Christ understand worshiping</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.060" end="01:04:47.150" style="s2">Christ is there as something that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.220" end="01:04:53.020" style="s2">moving towards well my personal thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.150" end="01:04:58.490" style="s2">on that right certainly but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.020" end="01:05:00.440" style="s2">thing yeah it&#39;s an approximation of all</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.490" end="01:05:03.680" style="s2">kinds of stories that we have yet to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.440" end="01:05:06.770" style="s2">integrate yeah the further the closer we</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.680" end="01:05:09.200" style="s2">get to it the more it expands yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.770" end="01:05:13.010" style="s2">is asymptotic that&#39;s that particular</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.200" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">recognition of who we could be is yes in</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.010" end="01:05:17.570" style="s2">it&#39;s infinitely deep and the further we</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:18.830" style="s2">go the more we integrate and the more we</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.570" end="01:05:21.109" style="s2">integrate with the more we recognize</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.830" end="01:05:26.180" style="s2">this order there is no dopamine we get</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.109" end="01:05:28.460" style="s2">like yes more the more especially when</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.180" end="01:05:30.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like especially when it&#39;s I am it</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.460" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">this is one of the things is I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.080" end="01:05:37.700" style="s2">still thinking about is like women</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:39.530" style="s2">involves like consciously moving towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.700" end="01:05:42.609" style="s2">suffering right but the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.530" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">suffering right when I do the hard thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.609" end="01:05:48.619" style="s2">in this case it is my dad talks about</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:50.900" style="s2">this you know he&#39;s the sober drug addict</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.619" end="01:05:53.630" style="s2">an alcoholic great like he says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.900" end="01:05:55.339" style="s2">always two kinds of buckets ready right</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.630" end="01:05:57.230" style="s2">there&#39;s okay fuck it I&#39;ll just do one</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.339" end="01:05:59.650" style="s2">more line and then there&#39;s okay fuck it</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.230" end="01:06:02.119" style="s2">I&#39;ll do the laundry okay like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.650" end="01:06:06.710" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing when I when I</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.119" end="01:06:08.270" style="s2">consciously do the harder thing in this</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.710" end="01:06:10.280" style="s2">and this is a whole other thing getting</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.270" end="01:06:12.410" style="s2">into this those notion of sacrifice like</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.280" end="01:06:14.570" style="s2">when I when I consciously sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.410" end="01:06:19.490" style="s2">something for the future that it does</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.570" end="01:06:21.050" style="s2">root for me or can often reward me when</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.490" end="01:06:23.570" style="s2">I do you know like as you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.050" end="01:06:25.310" style="s2">like ever since you use that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.570" end="01:06:28.310" style="s2">calling it ever since you told me this</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.310" end="01:06:30.170" style="s2">left you know make a list to do lifts</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.310" end="01:06:31.490" style="s2">and just think about like each time you</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.170" end="01:06:35.890" style="s2">check it out to a little dopamine hit</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.490" end="01:06:37.700" style="s2">great that there is this way in which</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.890" end="01:06:42.140" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.700" end="01:06:44.570" style="s2">that our biology is is in some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.140" end="01:06:46.730" style="s2">recognition of something transcendent in</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.570" end="01:06:50.570" style="s2">the future it&#39;s like aware of time in</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.730" end="01:06:54.290" style="s2">some way in that like it knows that okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.570" end="01:06:56.360" style="s2">if you do the hard thing to go forward</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.290" end="01:06:59.600" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna reward you so that you do</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.360" end="01:07:04.430" style="s2">the hard thing again like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.600" end="01:07:06.020" style="s2">way in which it there&#39;s a I postulate I</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.430" end="01:07:09.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know but like it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.020" end="01:07:11.060" style="s2">something is let let&#39;s say let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.110" end="01:07:15.110" style="s2">that that&#39;s the analogous to a muscle</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.060" end="01:07:18.230" style="s2">yeah right that you choose to do and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.110" end="01:07:20.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll say the more demanding thing the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.230" end="01:07:24.200" style="s2">more the more demanding of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.990" end="01:07:28.820" style="s2">wholesomeness your full attention your</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.200" end="01:07:31.460" style="s2">love right this this approaching the</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.820" end="01:07:33.650" style="s2">thing that&#39;s going on as if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.460" end="01:07:36.380" style="s2">trying to understand it not like</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.650" end="01:07:39.110" style="s2">categorize it but like go on the ride of</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.380" end="01:07:40.580" style="s2">it right in a way that you find it</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.110" end="01:07:42.860" style="s2">beautiful and you find it to be an</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.580" end="01:07:45.470" style="s2">expression of divinity right yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.860" end="01:07:49.040" style="s2">the more you do that&#39;s that is the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.470" end="01:07:51.590" style="s2">demanding thing that you can do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.040" end="01:07:53.390" style="s2">the hardest thing to do and when you do</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.590" end="01:07:55.040" style="s2">that let&#39;s say you look at your room and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.390" end="01:07:56.780" style="s2">your clothes are dirty and you know that</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.040" end="01:07:58.760" style="s2">if you do your laundry it sets up all of</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.780" end="01:08:00.140" style="s2">these other things and so you can play</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.760" end="01:08:01.790" style="s2">video games or you can do your laundry</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.140" end="01:08:05.150" style="s2">and you choose to do your laundry</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.790" end="01:08:08.540" style="s2">because that&#39;s going to create a more</p>

<p begin="01:10:06.800" end="01:10:15.500" style="s2">side right right the the guilt side yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.920" end="01:10:18.500" style="s2">which is that when I move towards the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.500" end="01:10:21.469" style="s2">more beautiful when I move towards</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.500" end="01:10:23.300" style="s2">building the muscle using my</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.469" end="01:10:26.630" style="s2">consciousness to go towards what is</p>

<p begin="01:10:37.670" end="01:10:40.790" style="s2">conscience gives me guilt and says</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.260" end="01:10:43.849" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good choice yeah</p>
