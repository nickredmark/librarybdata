<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">I&#39;m going to talk for about 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">just about some research that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">doing recently which came out in a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">book we just brought out called breaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">open and then I&#39;m gonna put you all into</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">break out rooms to discuss in hope you</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">one-on-ones breakout rooms some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:40.290" style="s2">ideas that we&#39;ve raised and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">come back for Q&amp;A so I am going to share</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.290" end="00:01:49.310" style="s2">the screen just to get my slides let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:49.310" style="s2">see if this works here we go okay right</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.729" end="00:01:57.829" style="s2">so I wrote this book which came out in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.159" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">2017 called the art of losing control</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.829" end="00:02:02.610" style="s2">and it was looking at the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">ecstatic experiences the first book I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.610" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">written was about ancient Greek</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">philosophy and stoicism and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">use that today and this book was looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">at the other side of really human</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">experience non-rational</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:20.610" style="s2">ecstatic experiences psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:23.550" style="s2">psychiatry doesn&#39;t talk that much about</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:26.099" style="s2">this type of experience and when it does</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.550" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">often uses different terminology for it</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.099" end="00:02:30.270" style="s2">so sometimes psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">psychiatrists call this mystical</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.270" end="00:02:36.739" style="s2">experiences or self-transcendent Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.930" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">Maslow called them peak experiences or</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.739" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">my fate of mixed experiences sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">psychologists use the phrase altered</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:48.830" style="s2">state of consciousness anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:51.900" style="s2">prefer like to talk about trance States</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.830" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">flow state which is a kind of a scrubbed</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.900" end="00:02:56.549" style="s2">up secular well-behaved version of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.080" end="00:02:59.790" style="s2">ecstasy that&#39;s popular in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.549" end="00:03:02.069" style="s2">coaching and then a bonus would also</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.790" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">talk about spirit possession and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.069" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">psychiatrist when they&#39;re pathologizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">this type of experience would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">this being really psychosis or</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">schizophrenia or perhaps bipolar</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">disorder so I like the expression</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">ecstatic experience which comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">ancient Greek ex fascist which literally</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:24.329" style="s2">means standing outside yourself your</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">ordinary self so an ecstatic experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.329" end="00:03:28.739" style="s2">the moment where you go beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:31.859" style="s2">ordinary sense of self and reality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.739" end="00:03:34.350" style="s2">feel deeply connected to a power or</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.859" end="00:03:37.950" style="s2">intelligence or something greater than</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.350" end="00:03:40.049" style="s2">you that can be you for ik or it can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.950" end="00:03:42.420" style="s2">terrifying so it&#39;s not true that ecstasy</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.049" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">means being very very happy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.420" end="00:03:47.640" style="s2">experience can be very scary it can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:50.850" style="s2">you could have it alone or you can have</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.640" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">a collective ecstatic experience and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.850" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">can interpret what you connect with in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:57.630" style="s2">many different ways you could interpret</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:04:00.120" style="s2">it as a connection to God or to a God or</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.630" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">to universal consciousness or to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.120" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">spirit or demon or to nature that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:07.859" style="s2">Romantic poets talk about like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.400" end="00:04:10.380" style="s2">sublime or perhaps to another person an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.859" end="00:04:12.540" style="s2">ecstatic connection in love or to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.380" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">group of people like at a rally or</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.540" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">festival or to your own higher self in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">other words it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:21.389" style="s2">theistic or supernatural people</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:23.170" style="s2">interpret this experience in different</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.389" end="00:04:27.170" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.170" end="00:04:30.830" style="s2">so most cultures most times in history</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.170" end="00:04:34.040" style="s2">have had ecstatic rituals for healing</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.830" end="00:04:37.250" style="s2">for meaning for connection and for fun</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:39.740" style="s2">as ways to go get out of our heads</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.250" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">it was Aldous Huxley who said humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.740" end="00:04:45.830" style="s2">have a basic urge to sell the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:48.710" style="s2">transcendent nature has to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.830" end="00:04:50.840" style="s2">give people access out of their heads</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.710" end="00:04:53.690" style="s2">give them avenues towards ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.840" end="00:04:55.580" style="s2">experiences but what&#39;s happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.690" end="00:04:57.770" style="s2">West if you look at the history of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.580" end="00:05:02.330" style="s2">ecstatic experience is there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.770" end="00:05:04.520" style="s2">centuries-long ideological war over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.330" end="00:05:07.910" style="s2">nature of mystical and ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.520" end="00:05:09.920" style="s2">experiences where since at least the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.910" end="00:05:11.890" style="s2">17th century in the Scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.920" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">Revolution and the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.890" end="00:05:16.820" style="s2">materialist philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:20.900" style="s2">psychologists and psychiatrists have</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.820" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">defined ecstasy as a mental illness so</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.900" end="00:05:25.850" style="s2">this lady was a patient at a French</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:28.520" style="s2">asylum called Salpetriere clinic in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.850" end="00:05:31.250" style="s2">Paris in the late 19th century she was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.520" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">patient of the pioneering neurologist</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.250" end="00:05:37.490" style="s2">jean-martin charcot and Charcot along</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.490" end="00:05:42.620" style="s2">19th century said ecstasy is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.370" end="00:05:44.180" style="s2">brain disorder he said it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.620" end="00:05:49.490" style="s2">symptom of a brain disorder called</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.180" end="00:05:51.110" style="s2">hysteria and this was and basically if</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.490" end="00:05:53.060" style="s2">you have the spiritual ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.110" end="00:05:55.400" style="s2">experience this is proof that your</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.060" end="00:05:58.900" style="s2">degenerate a kind of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.400" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">throwback that you&#39;re unfit for society</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.900" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">and you should be medicated and locks up</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:06.380" style="s2">so if you have a spiritual experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:08.510" style="s2">you should keep quiet about it and not</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.380" end="00:06:11.500" style="s2">tell other people this was part of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.510" end="00:06:13.820" style="s2">ideological struggle between materialist</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.500" end="00:06:17.180" style="s2">psychiatry and the church by the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.820" end="00:06:20.150" style="s2">over who gets to take care of the human</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.180" end="00:06:22.010" style="s2">soul but on the other side at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.150" end="00:06:25.040" style="s2">margins of Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.010" end="00:06:27.800" style="s2">you had ecstatic Christian groups like</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.040" end="00:06:31.430" style="s2">say Pentecostal lists and you had New</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.800" end="00:06:33.550" style="s2">Age culture saying that ecstasy was not</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.430" end="00:06:36.260" style="s2">primitive and aggressive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.550" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">pathological but actually the soup</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.260" end="00:06:40.949" style="s2">experience of human existence the best</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:43.410" style="s2">thing that could possibly happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.949" end="00:06:46.979" style="s2">and if you have an ecstatic experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.410" end="00:06:50.040" style="s2">that&#39;s proof that you are elect chosen</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.979" end="00:06:54.030" style="s2">by God superior to the rest of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.040" end="00:06:56.190" style="s2">in your maturity and realization that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.030" end="00:06:58.620" style="s2">you are at the vanguard of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.190" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">evolution so you can see there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.620" end="00:07:04.380" style="s2">dichotomy going on either an ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:07.740" style="s2">experience is wholly bad and</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.310" end="00:08:28.530" style="s2">I believe somewhere 1892 before Freud</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.620" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">before young and so on he said that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.530" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">ordinary everyday ego is just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:36.630" style="s2">construction a fiction and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:38.610" style="s2">a much bigger subliminal self which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.630" end="00:08:40.680" style="s2">just below the threshold that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.610" end="00:08:43.589" style="s2">subliminal means below the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.680" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">ordinary consciousness and then in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.589" end="00:08:48.810" style="s2">subliminal self there are hidden</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:49.830" style="s2">potentialities Maya said the subliminal</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.810" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">self is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.830" end="00:08:55.080" style="s2">the rubbish dump and the treasure train</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:57.000" style="s2">so Freud for example said you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.080" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;d is mainly a rubbish dump it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:05.670" style="s2">impulses Maya says yes there is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.820" end="00:09:07.560" style="s2">you know rubbish there there is detritus</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.670" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">there is a tendency to illogical</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.560" end="00:09:12.990" style="s2">thinking and sometimes that&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:16.829" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a treasure trove he said</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.990" end="00:09:21.060" style="s2">there are hidden potentialities in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.829" end="00:09:24.420" style="s2">subliminal mind potentiality of of</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:31.649" style="s2">the placebo response is really a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.579" end="00:09:34.079" style="s2">hidden potentiality of healing in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.649" end="00:09:36.300" style="s2">subliminal mind he also thought that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.079" end="00:09:38.880" style="s2">possibly things like telepathy could be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.300" end="00:09:40.649" style="s2">accessed when we access the subliminal</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.880" end="00:09:43.320" style="s2">mind and in trance states they were very</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.649" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2">interested in seances and mediums in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.320" end="00:09:49.019" style="s2">end of the 19th century and they also</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:51.870" style="s2">thought that possibly if we access some</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.019" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">kind of divine or spirit world we do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:56.700" style="s2">through the subliminal self when we go</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">into kind of subliminal or altered</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.700" end="00:10:03.260" style="s2">states of consciousness so according to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:06.120" style="s2">Myers and James&#39;s theory them an</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.260" end="00:10:09.089" style="s2">ecstatic experience is what Myers called</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.120" end="00:10:13.260" style="s2">an up crush from the subliminal mind a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.089" end="00:10:16.589" style="s2">sudden release of normally subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.260" end="00:10:19.829" style="s2">and repressed energy archetypal material</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.589" end="00:10:22.260" style="s2">and this kind of up rush creates a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.829" end="00:10:24.630" style="s2">possibility for a reconfiguration of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.260" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">self that&#39;s what William James was so</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.630" end="00:10:28.950" style="s2">interested in the way people could</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:31.770" style="s2">experience these kind of rebirth moments</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.950" end="00:10:34.290" style="s2">in ecstatic States like psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.770" end="00:10:36.449" style="s2">trips for example or conversion</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.290" end="00:10:38.010" style="s2">experiences you know they haven&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.449" end="00:10:40.350" style="s2">go into a profound altered state and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.010" end="00:10:46.980" style="s2">they feel themselves able to step out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.350" end="00:10:50.339" style="s2">their old selves into a new self but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.980" end="00:10:52.620" style="s2">also mean the release of shadow material</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.339" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a union expression like repressed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.620" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">trauma that you&#39;ve buried away from your</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:11:01.230" style="s2">ordinary everyday self and ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:03.220" style="s2">experiences also involve the disabling</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.230" end="00:11:06.110" style="s2">of your critical thinking fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.220" end="00:11:10.130" style="s2">which can make you prone to mythical</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.110" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">thinking them us thinking and very</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.130" end="00:11:14.750" style="s2">easily suggestible cults like thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:16.910" style="s2">as well so there are some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.750" end="00:11:20.269" style="s2">dangerous gases as it were they get</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.910" end="00:11:22.010" style="s2">released in ecstatic experiences so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.269" end="00:11:24.170" style="s2">Myers and James suggested that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.010" end="00:11:26.810" style="s2">genius one way to think about geniuses</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.170" end="00:11:28.930" style="s2">like John Nash saying is that they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.810" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">unusual access to the hidden</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.930" end="00:11:33.500" style="s2">potentialities of their subliminal mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:37.100" style="s2">and that gives them unusual powers of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.500" end="00:11:38.860" style="s2">say creativity or thinking or wisdom but</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.100" end="00:11:42.260" style="s2">it also can make them more prone to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.860" end="00:11:46.639" style="s2">unusual illogical disordered or</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.260" end="00:11:48.440" style="s2">pathological thinking so really a genius</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.639" end="00:11:50.180" style="s2">is someone who is access to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.440" end="00:11:52.760" style="s2">subliminal mind and all that power but</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.180" end="00:11:55.269" style="s2">also quite a powerful conscious ego and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.760" end="00:11:58.190" style="s2">quite a powerful positive discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.269" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">so they can sort the good from the bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.190" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">as it pours out from their subliminal</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:07.850" style="s2">mind now since the 1960s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:10.699" style="s2">obviously been a real value a ssin of</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.850" end="00:12:13.070" style="s2">ecstatic experiences an explosion of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.699" end="00:12:15.829" style="s2">ecstatic practices back into Western</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.070" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">culture they&#39;ve become much less</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.829" end="00:12:20.779" style="s2">pathologized and we&#39;ve got much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">eager to have some you know summaries</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.779" end="00:12:25.790" style="s2">experiences we can see data that shows</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:27.649" style="s2">that so this is a survey from Gallup</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.790" end="00:12:29.890" style="s2">which just asked people have you ever</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.649" end="00:12:32.600" style="s2">had a religious or mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.890" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">in America the number of people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.600" end="00:12:38.899" style="s2">said they&#39;ve had one or more has gone up</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:44.149" style="s2">from 20% in the start of the 1960&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.899" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">around 50% ten years ago in 2009 so more</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.149" end="00:12:47.060" style="s2">and more people are having mystical</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:50.510" style="s2">experiences apparently there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.060" end="00:12:52.310" style="s2">mysticism for the masses and I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.510" end="00:12:54.110" style="s2">that figure has just gone up in the last</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.310" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">10 years of the psychedelic Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.110" end="00:12:59.980" style="s2">where seven years ago over 30 million</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:03.170" style="s2">people in America said they were regular</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.980" end="00:13:07.370" style="s2">psychedelic users so more and more</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.170" end="00:13:10.970" style="s2">people are having mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.370" end="00:13:12.950" style="s2">but the question I&#39;m interested in as we</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.970" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">as a culture more and more seek these</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.950" end="00:13:18.740" style="s2">kinds of experiences is do we have the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:21.650" style="s2">cultural tools to help people have these</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.740" end="00:13:24.140" style="s2">very you know unusual and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.650" end="00:13:26.090" style="s2">risky experiences what if people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.140" end="00:13:28.580" style="s2">prepared to go beyond their habitual ego</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.090" end="00:13:33.080" style="s2">and don&#39;t know how to come back to</p>

<p begin="00:17:06.970" end="00:17:11.740" style="s2">and greater maturity and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.449" end="00:17:16.930" style="s2">true and I think that might be true of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.740" end="00:17:18.100" style="s2">many types of psychotic experience so my</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.930" end="00:17:19.569" style="s2">own spiritual emergency I became</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.100" end="00:17:21.819" style="s2">interested particularly in this topic I</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.569" end="00:17:23.880" style="s2">wrote about it a little in the art of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.819" end="00:17:27.459" style="s2">losing control</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.880" end="00:17:28.930" style="s2">then afterwards after I published that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.459" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">book I decided to go and try</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.930" end="00:17:34.140" style="s2">psychedelics for myself for the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:36.990" style="s2">time in 20 years after I&#39;d had a bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.140" end="00:17:38.540" style="s2">I was 18 I&#39;ve left them well clear but</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.990" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">in doing all this research on</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.540" end="00:17:43.830" style="s2">psychedelic therapy I was I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:47.400" style="s2">was maybe time to go to kind of try them</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.830" end="00:17:49.740" style="s2">again but in a proper guided context so</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.400" end="00:17:51.900" style="s2">I and I was also interested in spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.740" end="00:17:54.330" style="s2">tourism the way Westerners if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.900" end="00:17:56.130" style="s2">seeking that experiences sometimes feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.330" end="00:17:58.800" style="s2">like they have to go abroad to other</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.130" end="00:18:01.290" style="s2">cultures in search of kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.800" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">or ecstatic experience so I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.290" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">going to the Amazon to an indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:12.450" style="s2">Shipibo Indian ayahuasca retreat to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:16.100" style="s2">drink ayahuasca and the actual retreat</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.450" end="00:18:19.590" style="s2">was was kind of fascinating and and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.100" end="00:18:21.450" style="s2">very interesting and positive what</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.590" end="00:18:25.350" style="s2">happened then is in the days afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.450" end="00:18:28.590" style="s2">I went to the I went on to the Galapagos</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.350" end="00:18:31.500" style="s2">Islands and when I was there this was I</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.590" end="00:18:34.500" style="s2">suppose to days after the retreat I went</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.500" end="00:18:36.540" style="s2">into quite the dissociated space where I</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:41.220" style="s2">started to think I&#39;m not in ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.540" end="00:18:44.250" style="s2">reality my kind of ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.220" end="00:18:46.410" style="s2">critically was quite disabled so rather</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.250" end="00:18:48.120" style="s2">than thinking you&#39;re not in an alternate</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.410" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">reality you&#39;re just still hi after an</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.120" end="00:18:51.990" style="s2">ayahuasca retreat I&#39;ve came to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:55.110" style="s2">conclusion I was on my own of course I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:58.110" style="s2">think I&#39;m in a kind of dream or possibly</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.110" end="00:19:00.630" style="s2">I&#39;m in some kind of Bardo or afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.110" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">state and that somehow this is all of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.630" end="00:19:05.550" style="s2">kind of constructing so it was really</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:08.190" style="s2">kind of I wasn&#39;t freaking out but I did</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.550" end="00:19:12.660" style="s2">I didn&#39;t really trust the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.190" end="00:19:14.550" style="s2">reality I was in that last few days and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.660" end="00:19:16.350" style="s2">then a friend said you know I think you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.550" end="00:19:19.770" style="s2">better come home notes that you sound</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.350" end="00:19:21.510" style="s2">pretty dissociated so then I had to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.770" end="00:19:25.020" style="s2">all the way back to London I had to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.510" end="00:19:27.390" style="s2">three flights back from London back from</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.020" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">the Galapagos all the time thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.390" end="00:19:31.320" style="s2">was in a dream because I was in a dream</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:33.480" style="s2">I thought well I might as well upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.320" end="00:19:35.370" style="s2">to first class on the plane because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.480" end="00:19:38.700" style="s2">know money&#39;s this is all a figment of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.370" end="00:19:40.560" style="s2">imagination so I did it savvy it turned</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.700" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">out not to be a dream as well I got my</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.560" end="00:19:44.850" style="s2">bill credit card bill a few more a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:47.130" style="s2">weeks later but I remember landing</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.850" end="00:19:49.590" style="s2">finally in London and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.130" end="00:19:51.630" style="s2">and meeting me at the airport and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.590" end="00:19:53.460" style="s2">reminded me of like that scene in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.630" end="00:19:55.740" style="s2">Inception where he comes out into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.460" end="00:19:57.540" style="s2">airport and sees his family and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.740" end="00:19:59.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s a dream or a react</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.540" end="00:20:01.710" style="s2">or reality but he decides to go with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.790" end="00:20:04.200" style="s2">it was like that I wasn&#39;t still wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.710" end="00:20:05.220" style="s2">sure if my friend was real not I decided</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.200" end="00:20:07.680" style="s2">to go with it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.220" end="00:20:09.300" style="s2">so my friend and other friends luckily</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.680" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">they were familiar with this kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.300" end="00:20:15.240" style="s2">experience so they didn&#39;t just rush me</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">to a psychiatric ward a kind of even</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.240" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">love and care and lots of hugs and after</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:23.910" style="s2">a few days I I came back to this reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:28.740" style="s2">I came grounded back in this reality and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.910" end="00:20:30.150" style="s2">I was fine so obviously I was quite at</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.740" end="00:20:32.400" style="s2">one thing that was quite interesting by</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.150" end="00:20:35.160" style="s2">the way during that experience is that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.400" end="00:20:37.260" style="s2">found my critical thinking ability was</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.160" end="00:20:40.110" style="s2">quite disabled I found it difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.260" end="00:20:41.910" style="s2">understand conversations to watch films</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.110" end="00:20:44.280" style="s2">to read books it was very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.910" end="00:20:46.410" style="s2">make sense to me but I borrowed this</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.280" end="00:20:49.050" style="s2">book from someone and by Pema Chodron</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.410" end="00:20:51.470" style="s2">who&#39;s a Buddhist nun this book made</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.050" end="00:20:54.330" style="s2">perfect sense to me all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.470" end="00:20:55.950" style="s2">that kind of wisdom really worked for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.330" end="00:20:58.530" style="s2">so I found that these kinds of basic</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.950" end="00:21:00.840" style="s2">wisdom teachings worked even in very</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.530" end="00:21:04.920" style="s2">limited states of consciousness which</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.840" end="00:21:07.260" style="s2">was interesting to me so after that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.920" end="00:21:10.740" style="s2">became obviously more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.260" end="00:21:13.020" style="s2">spiritual emergencies I organized an</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.740" end="00:21:15.720" style="s2">event where several people talked about</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.020" end="00:21:18.170" style="s2">their own spiritual emergencies and out</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.720" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">of that I and some of the speakers</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.170" end="00:21:22.980" style="s2">helped to put this book together which</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:26.160" style="s2">came out last month which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.980" end="00:21:28.200" style="s2">14 people&#39;s stories of their spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.160" end="00:21:32.160" style="s2">emergencies and what helped them through</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.200" end="00:21:34.050" style="s2">my co-editor was Tim Reid who is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.160" end="00:21:35.790" style="s2">psychiatrist he&#39;s the consultant</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.050" end="00:21:40.140" style="s2">psychiatrist at Imperial colleges</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.790" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">psychedelics lab and he he&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.140" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">transpersonal psychiatrist he that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:49.290" style="s2">a psychiatrist who&#39;s open to positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:52.020" style="s2">spiritual experiences and we tried to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.290" end="00:21:54.210" style="s2">agnostic about what spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.020" end="00:21:56.940" style="s2">experiences mean in the sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.210" end="00:21:58.380" style="s2">you connect to whether it&#39;s to God or</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.940" end="00:22:00.169" style="s2">the spirit world and so on we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.380" end="00:22:02.389" style="s2">agnostic about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.169" end="00:22:04.570" style="s2">we let our contributors make up their</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.389" end="00:22:08.359" style="s2">own minds about that but we ask them</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.570" end="00:22:10.669" style="s2">what caused this experience what was it</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.359" end="00:22:12.590" style="s2">like and what helps so it was very much</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.669" end="00:22:16.429" style="s2">a pragmatic viewpoint what helps you</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.590" end="00:22:18.710" style="s2">through so what caused it well of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.429" end="00:22:20.179" style="s2">we can&#39;t we talk about genetic factors</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.710" end="00:22:22.249" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have the data for that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.179" end="00:22:25.129" style="s2">there could be some genetic factors for</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.249" end="00:22:28.460" style="s2">example a predisposition to dissociation</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.129" end="00:22:30.619" style="s2">or schizotypal schizo type is basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.460" end="00:22:33.639" style="s2">a theoretical concept which suggests</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.619" end="00:22:37.009" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuum of personality</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.639" end="00:22:38.929" style="s2">experiences of being prone to unusual</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.009" end="00:22:40.700" style="s2">experiences ranging from normal</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.929" end="00:22:42.590" style="s2">dissociative imaginative states like</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.700" end="00:22:45.019" style="s2">being a cabin capacity for flow for</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.590" end="00:22:47.299" style="s2">example or for creative trance states</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.019" end="00:22:50.029" style="s2">all the way to extreme states of mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.299" end="00:22:51.739" style="s2">related to psychosis and basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.029" end="00:22:53.149" style="s2">that&#39;s continuing though of those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.739" end="00:22:57.559" style="s2">of states of mind through the general</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.149" end="00:23:00.230" style="s2">population we did see in several of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.559" end="00:23:03.259" style="s2">contributors that they&#39;d had childhood</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.230" end="00:23:06.379" style="s2">trauma and trauma on their teenage time</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.259" end="00:23:08.929" style="s2">so perhaps former makes people more</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.379" end="00:23:11.269" style="s2">prone to having messy spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.929" end="00:23:13.629" style="s2">experiences when for example they take</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.269" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">psychedelics or go to spiritual retreats</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.629" end="00:23:18.049" style="s2">because they have perhaps kind of buried</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:20.239" style="s2">trauma and they go beyond their ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.049" end="00:23:21.950" style="s2">self and some of this shadow stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.239" end="00:23:24.950" style="s2">this buried trauma comes out and makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.950" end="00:23:27.169" style="s2">them more likely to have a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.950" end="00:23:29.090" style="s2">experience which doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.169" end="00:23:31.639" style="s2">experience because sometimes that could</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.090" end="00:23:34.669" style="s2">be the trauma demanding the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.639" end="00:23:38.090" style="s2">attention demanding this is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.669" end="00:23:40.609" style="s2">opportunity for integration in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.090" end="00:23:43.009" style="s2">the short term trigger for the crises</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.609" end="00:23:45.259" style="s2">what we saw in our in our police studies</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.009" end="00:23:48.369" style="s2">or in these stories of some people it</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.259" end="00:23:51.259" style="s2">was psychedelic drugs for some people</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.369" end="00:23:53.749" style="s2">the emergency was triggered by intense</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.259" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">spiritual exercises for example going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.749" end="00:23:58.929" style="s2">a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:02.840" style="s2">some people it was triggered by grief</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.929" end="00:24:05.000" style="s2">the loss of a significant other or a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:07.929" style="s2">very bad breakup</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.000" end="00:24:10.510" style="s2">we noticed that for me and for others</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.929" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">they often happen when people are abroad</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.510" end="00:24:15.470" style="s2">and away from their usual support</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:19.940" style="s2">network and that made them more prone to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.470" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">getting into difficulty of course you</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.940" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">know through our friends and loved ones</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">that we kind of stay grounded and stay</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:29.690" style="s2">in touch with with each other and can</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:31.549" style="s2">reallocate check and then in one story</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.690" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">in the book their spiritual crisis was</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.549" end="00:24:35.539" style="s2">triggered by a political crisis by</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:39.590" style="s2">brexit so they had a kind of brexit</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.539" end="00:24:41.899" style="s2">triggered psychosis which is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.590" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">in terms of this crisis of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.899" end="00:24:47.029" style="s2">I suspect that the pandemic is also</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:50.179" style="s2">probably triggering certain individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.029" end="00:24:52.010" style="s2">spiritual crises as well and the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.179" end="00:24:55.429" style="s2">might also cause be a supernatural cause</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.010" end="00:24:57.380" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that something you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.429" end="00:24:59.029" style="s2">God or something in the spirit world was</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.380" end="00:25:01.010" style="s2">seeking out these people at least that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.029" end="00:25:03.049" style="s2">how some of our contributors made sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.010" end="00:25:04.820" style="s2">of these experiences that this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.049" end="00:25:06.980" style="s2">just a personal experience in their head</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.820" end="00:25:10.250" style="s2">it was also an encounter with a greater</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.980" end="00:25:14.059" style="s2">reality we as the editors remained</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.250" end="00:25:16.340" style="s2">agnostic about what what is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.059" end="00:25:18.529" style="s2">experience like well what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.340" end="00:25:20.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a buildup of kind of tension</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.529" end="00:25:23.390" style="s2">within this contact whether that&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.840" end="00:25:25.159" style="s2">trip or on a retreat and then suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.390" end="00:25:27.470" style="s2">have flip into another state of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.159" end="00:25:31.070" style="s2">consciousness and the person stays in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.470" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">that altered state of consciousness time</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.070" end="00:25:36.950" style="s2">slows down the person&#39;s attention is</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:39.940" style="s2">deeply absorbed in the moment things</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.950" end="00:25:42.919" style="s2">take on a heightened numinous</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.940" end="00:25:45.289" style="s2">significance there&#39;s an overlap of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.919" end="00:25:47.240" style="s2">inner and outer world it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.289" end="00:25:49.730" style="s2">dream camera and the only ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.240" end="00:25:53.179" style="s2">camera become overlapped superimposed on</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.730" end="00:25:55.669" style="s2">each other so dream archetypal and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.179" end="00:25:58.010" style="s2">mythical material spills out into</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.669" end="00:26:00.649" style="s2">everyday life you&#39;re dreaming with your</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.010" end="00:26:03.470" style="s2">eyes open and people notice</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.649" end="00:26:08.029" style="s2">synchronicities signs patterns hidden</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.470" end="00:26:09.530" style="s2">meanings uncanny coincidences and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.029" end="00:26:12.440" style="s2">person may see them</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.530" end="00:26:13.820" style="s2">as some kind of cosmic archetype so some</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.440" end="00:26:17.270" style="s2">of our contributors saw themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.820" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">Jesus or evil Ishtar</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.270" end="00:26:21.260" style="s2">so there&#39;s this kind of you know these</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:23.300" style="s2">archetypes always there in our dreams</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.260" end="00:26:25.070" style="s2">but a person can become possessed by</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.300" end="00:26:26.690" style="s2">these archetypes by which I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.070" end="00:26:29.780" style="s2">completely lose any distance they</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.690" end="00:26:33.310" style="s2">completely identify with this archetype</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.780" end="00:26:37.940" style="s2">so one of our contributors john abel it</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.310" end="00:26:40.910" style="s2">decided he is enlightened and he became</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.940" end="00:26:41.990" style="s2">a spiritual teacher when he was 21 he</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.910" end="00:26:45.400" style="s2">was he became got the nickname the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.990" end="00:26:47.540" style="s2">barefoot guru and people followed him</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.400" end="00:26:50.060" style="s2">for for days and weeks</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.540" end="00:26:51.830" style="s2">even his university lecturers started to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.060" end="00:26:53.300" style="s2">kind of pay him all this great respect</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.830" end="00:26:55.910" style="s2">so he kind of was on his way to becoming</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.300" end="00:26:58.580" style="s2">a guru and then he suddenly kind of came</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.910" end="00:27:00.830" style="s2">down a bit came off that high and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.580" end="00:27:03.020" style="s2">thought I&#39;m not enlightened and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.830" end="00:27:05.780" style="s2">I&#39;m just playing a role now and he had</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.020" end="00:27:08.510" style="s2">the kind of courage to leave that guru</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.780" end="00:27:10.760" style="s2">role and go back to his family and go</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.510" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">back to his kind of you know young adult</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.760" end="00:27:15.500" style="s2">life which took a lot of guts I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:17.960" style="s2">how many gurus have that kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.500" end="00:27:20.120" style="s2">down from that high but gets stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.960" end="00:27:22.760" style="s2">the role and they get into all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.120" end="00:27:26.330" style="s2">problems there&#39;s often a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.760" end="00:27:27.920" style="s2">unreality of ego dissolution a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.330" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">that you might have died or you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.920" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">some kind of Apocalypse or end times a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.940" style="s2">feeling of ontological uncertainty this</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">is definitely what I was like for me is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.940" end="00:27:40.430" style="s2">this real is this a dream am i</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:42.950" style="s2">constructing this am i God in that case</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.430" end="00:27:44.630" style="s2">or am i dead it was a bit like The</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.950" end="00:27:46.400" style="s2">Truman Show in that respect which i</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.630" end="00:27:49.460" style="s2">think is quite common for kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.400" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">psychotic experiences and I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.460" end="00:27:52.220" style="s2">interested after my experience to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:53.510" style="s2">that this is quite common to have that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.220" end="00:27:55.220" style="s2">feeling well I had that you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.510" end="00:27:57.490" style="s2">either in a dream or dead</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.220" end="00:27:59.860" style="s2">so John where Perry who was a pioneering</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.490" end="00:28:01.820" style="s2">psychologist in the 70s who ran a</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.570" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">so what helped our contributors three</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.590" end="00:30:19.580" style="s2">we&#39;d looked at kind of set setting and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:21.530" style="s2">integration which is a kind of an idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.580" end="00:30:25.420" style="s2">that&#39;s come from psychedelic therapy of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.530" end="00:30:28.190" style="s2">course setting a sympathetic calm</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.420" end="00:30:31.100" style="s2">non-judgmental setting helps the mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.190" end="00:30:33.740" style="s2">settle the mind and body slow down and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.100" end="00:30:35.870" style="s2">stabilize so in my case for example just</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.740" end="00:30:36.590" style="s2">having friends who are non-judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.870" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.590" end="00:30:42.500" style="s2">freaked out and who could just give me</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:46.039" style="s2">support and love human connection love</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.500" end="00:30:50.600" style="s2">and touch hugs helps bring the mind back</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.039" end="00:30:52.820" style="s2">from its flight to transcendence maps</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.600" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">and guides can also help us find our way</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:58.820" style="s2">books friends therapists support groups</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.299" end="00:31:01.130" style="s2">like the spiritual crisis network or</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.130" end="00:31:06.710" style="s2">support groups at the end and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.850" end="00:31:08.330" style="s2">drugs can help take the edge off as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.710" end="00:31:11.299" style="s2">tranquilizers may help when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.330" end="00:31:13.730" style="s2">acute anxiety but of course psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.299" end="00:31:16.130" style="s2">wards are not always the best setting if</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.730" end="00:31:17.809" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to slow your mind down</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.130" end="00:31:20.360" style="s2">when it&#39;s they don&#39;t really heightened a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.809" end="00:31:23.559" style="s2">kind of mystical sting can be easy to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.360" end="00:31:26.570" style="s2">flip into and a kind of paranoid state</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.559" end="00:31:29.059" style="s2">and what about the mindset well all our</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.570" end="00:31:31.880" style="s2">contributors managed to find a positive</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.059" end="00:31:34.460" style="s2">frame of meaning and growth for these</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.880" end="00:31:37.159" style="s2">difficult experiences rather than just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.460" end="00:31:39.890" style="s2">pathological frame of breakdown and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.159" end="00:31:41.390" style="s2">disease so the frame on which they</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.890" end="00:31:43.399" style="s2">manage to take their experience was</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.390" end="00:31:45.740" style="s2">really important it reminds me of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.399" end="00:31:47.450" style="s2">stoic quote from Epictetus what disturbs</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.740" end="00:31:49.370" style="s2">people is not events but their opinion</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.450" end="00:31:51.140" style="s2">about events it&#39;s not so much these</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.370" end="00:31:53.000" style="s2">weird experiences it&#39;s the frame you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.140" end="00:31:56.659" style="s2">have of them that decides whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.000" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">healthy or not a lot of our contributors</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.659" end="00:32:01.399" style="s2">said that mindfulness practices to</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:04.070" style="s2">connect to their body their breath and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.399" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">their senses really helped them again</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.070" end="00:32:07.549" style="s2">because they had gone into dissociated</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:10.130" style="s2">states where they&#39;d left ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.549" end="00:32:12.710" style="s2">material reality so it&#39;s really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.130" end="00:32:14.899" style="s2">to kind of ground back with their body</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.710" end="00:32:19.640" style="s2">in their breath and in this material</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.899" end="00:32:22.760" style="s2">reality an attitude of acceptance helped</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.640" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">reminding ourselves this world pass was</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.760" end="00:32:26.750" style="s2">very helpful for me and having</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:29.559" style="s2">compassion for yourself even when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.750" end="00:32:33.799" style="s2">you know in a completely altered reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.559" end="00:32:36.529" style="s2">an attitude of humility helped some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.799" end="00:32:39.140" style="s2">our contributors avoiding what Ram Dass</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.529" end="00:32:40.760" style="s2">called the track of specialness if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.140" end="00:32:43.789" style="s2">have an ecstatic experience and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.760" end="00:32:45.770" style="s2">think I&#39;m special I am unique this</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.789" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">happened to me I am one of the elect</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.770" end="00:32:50.600" style="s2">that can easily lead to ego inflation</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:53.030" style="s2">and grandiosity</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.600" end="00:32:55.730" style="s2">and that can easily flip into</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.030" end="00:32:58.850" style="s2">persecution if I am the Messiah then</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.730" end="00:33:01.669" style="s2">maybe there are others out to get me</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.850" end="00:33:04.970" style="s2">so humility staying grounded just</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.669" end="00:33:07.070" style="s2">because you have a fragment of the law</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.970" end="00:33:10.700" style="s2">so God within you doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.070" end="00:33:12.470" style="s2">alone are God so we can you know trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.700" end="00:33:14.780" style="s2">to identify with these cosmic archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.470" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">without becoming possessed by them what</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.780" end="00:33:21.080" style="s2">Alan Watts called no-fuss spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:24.350" style="s2">and finally discernment am i perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.080" end="00:33:26.360" style="s2">taking a dream metaphor / literally this</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.350" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">for example a band took ayahuasca and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.360" end="00:33:30.740" style="s2">got a message that he should construct a</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.280" end="00:33:42.010" style="s2">fundamentalist interpretation of it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.350" end="00:33:45.020" style="s2">that can happen quite a lot so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.010" end="00:33:46.580" style="s2">integration well I&#39;m I could say a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.020" end="00:33:48.740" style="s2">more about it but I want to put you into</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.580" end="00:33:50.450" style="s2">breakout rooms but briefly many of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.740" end="00:33:51.710" style="s2">contributors had a first crisis for</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.450" end="00:33:53.690" style="s2">which they were unprepared which was</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.710" end="00:33:55.520" style="s2">traumatic then after a period of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.690" end="00:33:57.770" style="s2">training they had a second crisis which</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.520" end="00:33:59.270" style="s2">they&#39;re able to handle which reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.770" end="00:34:01.309" style="s2">a bit of Luke Skywalker how he got his</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.950" end="00:34:08.810" style="s2">period of training and is able to face</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.110" end="00:34:12.080" style="s2">his shadow with mindfulness compassion</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.810" end="00:34:14.090" style="s2">and non reactivity and the second crisis</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.080" end="00:34:16.550" style="s2">helps our participants to feel more</p>
