<p begin="00:00:15.019" end="00:00:19.910" style="s2">maladies a biography of cancer by</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.450" end="00:00:22.340" style="s2">Siddhartha Mukherjee and this is a book</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.910" end="00:00:25.130" style="s2">that paints the history it tells the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.340" end="00:00:26.570" style="s2">story of how cancer research began in</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.130" end="00:00:29.660" style="s2">the early history of human civilization</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.570" end="00:00:32.540" style="s2">and the earliest recorded cases back in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.660" end="00:00:34.010" style="s2">ancient Egypt all the way through the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.540" end="00:00:36.740" style="s2">medical discoveries of the last few</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.010" end="00:00:39.230" style="s2">centuries and especially in the last 100</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.740" end="00:00:41.600" style="s2">years up to the present and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.230" end="00:00:43.100" style="s2">that this book is so important for those</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.600" end="00:00:46.280" style="s2">of us that want to create social change</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.100" end="00:00:48.890" style="s2">is that it goes through and explores how</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.280" end="00:00:50.810" style="s2">ideas can compete with each other within</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.890" end="00:00:52.399" style="s2">different groups of people and how the</p>

<p begin="00:00:52.399" end="00:00:58.760" style="s2">activities can lead to progress and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.610" end="00:01:01.070" style="s2">this case the book focusing on cancer</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.760" end="00:01:04.100" style="s2">helps us understand the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.070" end="00:01:07.159" style="s2">between say the advances in surgical</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.100" end="00:01:09.820" style="s2">procedures and the power dynamics of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.159" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">surgeon&#39;s as very important people in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.820" end="00:01:14.900" style="s2">powerful people in medical institutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:17.000" style="s2">and say the late nineteenth and early</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.900" end="00:01:19.659" style="s2">twentieth centuries and then new</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.000" end="00:01:22.630" style="s2">technological and scientific discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.659" end="00:01:25.640" style="s2">associated with genetics and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.630" end="00:01:29.360" style="s2">pharmaceuticals that led to chemotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.640" end="00:01:31.549" style="s2">and then later hormone therapy for</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.360" end="00:01:34.280" style="s2">dealing with cancer and one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.549" end="00:01:36.680" style="s2">really loved about this book is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.280" end="00:01:38.869" style="s2">even as a dealt with this really</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.680" end="00:01:42.049" style="s2">difficult and somewhat depressing topic</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.869" end="00:01:43.880" style="s2">of cancer and the hardships and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.049" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">difficult it was for people to survive</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.880" end="00:01:48.259" style="s2">when they were diagnosed with cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:50.540" style="s2">a lot of the book focuses on leukemia</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.259" end="00:01:53.780" style="s2">and cancer and children which is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.540" end="00:01:57.590" style="s2">difficult topic to study but as you go</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.780" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">through and read the history of how far</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.590" end="00:02:01.369" style="s2">we&#39;ve come and how much we now</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:03.170" style="s2">understand and also specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.369" end="00:02:05.090" style="s2">ways that the advances were made it</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.170" end="00:02:08.330" style="s2">actually is quite an inspiring and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.090" end="00:02:11.209" style="s2">hopeful story so for example we now are</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.330" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">in a place where the complexity of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.209" end="00:02:16.829" style="s2">approach to treating cancer</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:18.930" style="s2">is on par with the complexity of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.829" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">itself meaning that it&#39;s becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.930" end="00:02:23.549" style="s2">tractable problem and something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:26.189" style="s2">while we may never get rid of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.549" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">entirely it&#39;s becoming much more at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.189" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">treatable type of disease or category of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:35.099" style="s2">many diseases that we now deal with on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">regular basis and so what I love about</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.099" end="00:02:40.739" style="s2">this book is it shows us how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:42.900" style="s2">understand the way that advances can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.739" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">made in really complex issues how much</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.900" end="00:02:47.629" style="s2">progress can be made in just a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.150" style="s2">decades and also the interplay of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.629" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">institutional cultural and technological</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.150" end="00:02:54.120" style="s2">changes can all come together and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:55.980" style="s2">converge to solve really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">problems so if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.980" end="00:03:00.659" style="s2">understanding how cultural systems can</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:02.730" style="s2">evolve in time where there are very</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.659" end="00:03:04.889" style="s2">difficult problems with direct human</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.730" end="00:03:07.049" style="s2">consequences and how progress can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.889" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">made over a span of time through</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.049" end="00:03:12.389" style="s2">collaboration institution building</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:14.700" style="s2">policy design science and policy and our</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.389" end="00:03:17.189" style="s2">interactions and a passion and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.700" end="00:03:18.690" style="s2">dedication of individual people then</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.189" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">this is really a wonderful book to read</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.690" end="00:03:22.109" style="s2">and of course it did when a pure appeal</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:24.659" style="s2">it surprised and it&#39;s quite widely read</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.109" end="00:03:27.329" style="s2">already but I want to suggest that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.659" end="00:03:28.530" style="s2">should be part of the toolkit for people</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.329" end="00:03:31.199" style="s2">that are trying to create large scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.530" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">social change so that&#39;s it go out and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.199" end="00:03:34.680" style="s2">get the Emperor of all maladies if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:37.829" style="s2">want to understand how cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.680" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">evolution can guide the solving of very</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.829" end="00:03:42.030" style="s2">difficult problems in society and um you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:44.479" style="s2">know let me know what you think alright</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.030" end="00:03:44.479" style="s2">thanks a lot</p>
