<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">designing a challenge to me so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:21.060" style="s2">to be leaning up against the wall just</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">to give myself a little bit of extra</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.060" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">stability so what we&#39;re doing today is</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">like I said we&#39;re going to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">find your flow now this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">something that people at least associate</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.630" end="00:01:34.470" style="s2">with meditation and it&#39;s a correct</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">Association but typically how they frame</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.470" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">it might be wrong this is your ability</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">to get very sort of absorbed in your</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">meditation really really get deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">engaged and involved in it and people</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">think this is sort of a matter of will</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">sort of got a will myself in and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">talk more about this on Thursday with</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:55.380" style="s2">getting the right kind of concentration</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s not really a matter of will its</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.380" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">instead it&#39;s a matter of engaging what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">called flow as I mentioned I study folk</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">scientifically and I published on it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">the Oxford Handbook of spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">thought with Leah frog an area in Para</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:11.650" style="s2">Bennett and the basic idea wife Lois was</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:13.480" style="s2">there was study first</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.650" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">sort of explicitly a developed by chicks</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.480" end="00:02:18.610" style="s2">that Mahina book called flow this like</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:20.920" style="s2">it&#39;s for some of you are interested I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.610" end="00:02:22.930" style="s2">believe it&#39;s the second video came from</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.920" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">the meeting crisis series when I talk at</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.930" end="00:02:26.980" style="s2">length about flow and what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.420" style="s2">there for our purpose is flow is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.980" end="00:02:31.180" style="s2">state you know when you&#39;re we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.420" end="00:02:33.610" style="s2">engaged in the task and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.180" end="00:02:36.459" style="s2">involving that you&#39;re sort of a looser</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.610" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">sense of the normal passage of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.459" end="00:02:42.280" style="s2">everything seemed sort of super salient</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.780" style="s2">right but not airing sort of egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.280" end="00:02:45.250" style="s2">mainly in your mind how am i doing what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.780" end="00:02:47.500" style="s2">are people thinking falls away because</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.250" end="00:02:49.870" style="s2">you&#39;re so absorbed in the task you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:51.579" style="s2">that you&#39;re exerting a lot of effort but</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.870" end="00:02:57.250" style="s2">it seems effortless people get it under</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.579" end="00:03:00.250" style="s2">dancing its sparring playing jazz rock</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.250" end="00:03:02.909" style="s2">climbing so what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.250" end="00:03:05.799" style="s2">engage the flow state because the flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.909" end="00:03:09.069" style="s2">state we&#39;re going to get learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.799" end="00:03:11.859" style="s2">get really more involved and really</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.069" end="00:03:13.090" style="s2">almost welling within our meditative</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.859" end="00:03:14.409" style="s2">focus that&#39;s a skill you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.090" end="00:03:17.139" style="s2">practice and you also have to set the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.409" end="00:03:18.549" style="s2">conditions up correctly notice what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.139" end="00:03:20.200" style="s2">mentioned about the flow state what</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.549" end="00:03:22.150" style="s2">people are in the flow state that report</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.200" end="00:03:25.480" style="s2">that all that chatter in their head goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:27.069" style="s2">way because of the intensity of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.480" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">involvement so instead of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.069" end="00:03:33.609" style="s2">this as willpower to give it more as</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:36.250" style="s2">increasing involvement so what are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.609" end="00:03:38.769" style="s2">conditions that get us into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.250" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">state but what we have to do is you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.769" end="00:03:42.280" style="s2">to put it you have to put a challenge on</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">yourself so that the demands that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.280" end="00:03:46.269" style="s2">putting on yourself jobs throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:48.970" style="s2">edge of your skills you have to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.269" end="00:03:50.739" style="s2">engage all of your skills in order to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.970" end="00:03:52.810" style="s2">meet the demands and that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.739" end="00:03:55.810" style="s2">constant sort of shifting on the demands</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.810" end="00:03:57.849" style="s2">you have two key sort of ratcheting up</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.810" end="00:04:00.220" style="s2">the challenge you need very clear</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.849" end="00:04:01.720" style="s2">feedback and your actions and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.220" end="00:04:03.940" style="s2">response from the environment has to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.720" end="00:04:08.079" style="s2">tightly coupled well how do we bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.940" end="00:04:10.120" style="s2">that into our meditation and then how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.079" end="00:04:11.799" style="s2">we also integrate that with what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.120" end="00:04:17.859" style="s2">trying to cultivate and mindfulness was</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.799" end="00:04:22.660" style="s2">it which is an increasing sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.859" end="00:04:25.210" style="s2">present and coupled to an environment so</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.660" end="00:04:27.850" style="s2">following I&#39;m gonna teach you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:30.040" style="s2">expand and enrich and enhance your</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.850" end="00:04:31.390" style="s2">awareness with your attention so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.040" end="00:04:33.610" style="s2">normally when people are following their</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.390" end="00:04:35.110" style="s2">breath or following their breath so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.610" end="00:04:36.610" style="s2">just gonna talk right now don&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.110" end="00:04:39.970" style="s2">doing this I will talk you through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.610" end="00:04:41.170" style="s2">exercise when we&#39;re in the set okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.970" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">when people are following their breath</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.170" end="00:04:45.100" style="s2">they&#39;ve got this little little sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">spot here perhaps where they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.100" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">fueling dispensations so after we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:52.570" style="s2">taken time they&#39;ll be silenced and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:55.300" style="s2">you&#39;ll Center and you&#39;re rude all three</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.570" end="00:04:56.290" style="s2">lines will bring their attention to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.300" end="00:04:58.540" style="s2">where we&#39;re going to follow the breath</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.290" end="00:05:02.280" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll ask you to expand your</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.540" end="00:05:04.360" style="s2">awareness so expand it over your abdomen</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.280" end="00:05:06.340" style="s2">remember we talked about increasing your</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.360" end="00:05:08.200" style="s2">interoception and integrating it with</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.340" end="00:05:10.900" style="s2">your introspection so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.200" end="00:05:12.700" style="s2">expand it over your abdomen and into</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.900" end="00:05:14.590" style="s2">your abdomen like if somebody was asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.700" end="00:05:17.950" style="s2">you how&#39;s your stomach feeling inside</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.590" end="00:05:21.940" style="s2">like when you have a doctor okay so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.950" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna expand right I&#39;m gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.940" end="00:05:25.990" style="s2">you to enrich your awareness what do I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:29.200" style="s2">mean by that is try to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.990" end="00:05:32.790" style="s2">many different kinds of sensations their</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.200" end="00:05:36.040" style="s2">sensations of movement temperature</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.790" end="00:05:37.480" style="s2">texture tightness and also different</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.040" end="00:05:40.030" style="s2">patterns of sensations will</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.480" end="00:05:41.850" style="s2">automatically constantly for you so what</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.030" end="00:05:43.690" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.850" end="00:05:45.970" style="s2">distinguishing different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.690" end="00:05:47.560" style="s2">sensations right and you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.970" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">expanding your awareness and letting</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:51.070" style="s2">patterns form so you sort of zooming</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:53.110" style="s2">your awareness out and yet you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.070" end="00:05:55.180" style="s2">actually a good at that I&#39;m gonna hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.110" end="00:05:59.950" style="s2">this up and I want here to quickly read</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.180" end="00:06:02.830" style="s2">it okay so the cat now notice how you</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.950" end="00:06:04.540" style="s2">read this as an H and this is an a even</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.830" end="00:06:07.150" style="s2">though they&#39;re the same because what</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.540" end="00:06:09.430" style="s2">you&#39;re doing right what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.150" end="00:06:11.860" style="s2">part of your attention is going up to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.430" end="00:06:13.930" style="s2">the whole word in order to disambiguate</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.860" end="00:06:15.760" style="s2">the letters but part of your attention</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.930" end="00:06:17.920" style="s2">is also going down to the individual</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.649" end="00:06:46.359" style="s2">that they can live in another world so</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.790" end="00:25:36.160" style="s2">this is how you get their practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.550" end="00:25:38.620" style="s2">integrating state of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.160" end="00:25:40.180" style="s2">cognition there you had in your practice</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">questions this is from the Kennedy High</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.970" end="00:25:53.380" style="s2">neck makes a former student of mine I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">initially taken but passed the course</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.380" end="00:25:57.790" style="s2">that instructed counting to ten while</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:26:00.520" style="s2">sitting should I label that habit as</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.790" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">counting to what seems to be the expense</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.520" end="00:26:08.730" style="s2">of a better quality sit if you&#39;re if the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.530" end="00:26:12.040" style="s2">practice is working for you then use it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.730" end="00:26:15.670" style="s2">I&#39;m going to show you a practice on</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.040" end="00:26:17.770" style="s2">Thursday that&#39;s very similar for finding</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.670" end="00:26:19.180" style="s2">appropriate concentration there so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.770" end="00:26:21.040" style="s2">might be as want to do the counting</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.180" end="00:26:23.230" style="s2">rather than following your breath and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.040" end="00:26:23.650" style="s2">you debate everything else that works</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.230" end="00:26:26.470" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.650" end="00:26:29.970" style="s2">I find following the breath without the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.470" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">counting is better long term because</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:35.830" style="s2">then you can sort of do it without any</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:38.230" style="s2">sort inner words happening but that will</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.830" end="00:26:40.360" style="s2">take time and so if you&#39;re finding that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.230" end="00:26:41.350" style="s2">the practice works for you you should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.360" end="00:26:44.380" style="s2">able to integrate it with what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.350" end="00:26:46.900" style="s2">teaching you the next is from Nick</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.380" end="00:26:48.730" style="s2">Nicholas I don&#39;t have time for a full</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.900" end="00:26:50.200" style="s2">meditation session but still want to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.730" end="00:26:51.550" style="s2">the routing process can I only do the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.200" end="00:26:53.260" style="s2">center route it seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.550" end="00:26:55.300" style="s2">strongest have the strongest impact if</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.260" end="00:26:56.980" style="s2">you genuinely don&#39;t have time yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.300" end="00:26:59.830" style="s2">find your Center find your route maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.980" end="00:27:02.140" style="s2">follow your breath for four breaths just</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.830" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2">do that basic then just do that basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.140" end="00:27:11.620" style="s2">thing continuity of practice is way more</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:14.740" style="s2">important than quantity of practice this</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.620" end="00:27:16.510" style="s2">is from Steven what to do about internal</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.740" end="00:27:17.740" style="s2">resistance if the time comes and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.510" end="00:27:19.750" style="s2">strongly don&#39;t want to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.740" end="00:27:21.580" style="s2">one day should I listen to my intuition</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.750" end="00:27:23.800" style="s2">or should I force myself to keep up with</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.580" end="00:27:25.930" style="s2">the practice so on when we get from</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.800" end="00:27:28.810" style="s2">teaching lesson six I&#39;ll tell you how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.930" end="00:27:30.160" style="s2">deal with that resistance what I suggest</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.810" end="00:27:33.370" style="s2">is if you&#39;re getting a strong inner</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.160" end="00:27:36.400" style="s2">resistance and there isn&#39;t a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.370" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">therapeutic or traumatic issue involved</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.400" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">you should just practice Center and Rudy</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:45.049" style="s2">just factor senator Rudy maybe finding</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:46.279" style="s2">your flow what I&#39;ll show you later to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.049" end="00:27:47.870" style="s2">is once you that&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.279" end="00:27:49.640" style="s2">stabilized when you get those strong</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.870" end="00:27:51.620" style="s2">feelings of resistance they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.640" end="00:27:52.730" style="s2">become your meditative focus so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.620" end="00:27:54.470" style="s2">could what you can do is you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.730" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">meditate on the resistance and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.470" end="00:27:58.610" style="s2">you&#39;re already meditating you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:28:01.070" style="s2">meditating even though you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.610" end="00:28:03.140" style="s2">experiencing the resistance so try right</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.070" end="00:28:06.770" style="s2">for now just finding your Center in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.140" end="00:28:08.960" style="s2">root and and your flow and just try to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.770" end="00:28:10.429" style="s2">keep up the continuity and then a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.960" end="00:28:12.260" style="s2">bit later we&#39;ll go over what I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.429" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">mentioned to you and that will help you</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.260" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">to deal with strong resistance one more</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:19.549" style="s2">time though I don&#39;t know you do but if</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">there is some psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.549" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">or trauma issues that need to be there</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:27.860" style="s2">are unresolved I&#39;m not saying you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:29.179" style="s2">that I&#39;m saying if they&#39;re like if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.860" end="00:28:30.529" style="s2">are considering treatment or you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.179" end="00:28:32.210" style="s2">treatment you need to talk to your</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.529" end="00:28:35.590" style="s2">therapist about it that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.210" end="00:28:35.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.220" end="00:28:42.529" style="s2">from Lars what exactly you do mean by</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.080" end="00:28:44.029" style="s2">patterns so what might happen is you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.529" end="00:28:47.059" style="s2">get sort of a bunch of tingling</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.029" end="00:28:48.200" style="s2">sensations and they and they all feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.059" end="00:28:50.330" style="s2">like they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.200" end="00:28:52.429" style="s2">forming a weird shape it may not happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.330" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">for you don&#39;t worry if it doesn&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.429" end="00:28:55.909" style="s2">can just pick up on different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:57.890" style="s2">sensations but for many people what</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.909" end="00:28:59.419" style="s2">happens is it&#39;s almost like it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.890" end="00:29:01.100" style="s2">like music for them they can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.419" end="00:29:02.809" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a sort of rhythm of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.100" end="00:29:04.340" style="s2">sensations and the foreground of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.809" end="00:29:06.440" style="s2">ones at the background that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.340" end="00:29:08.600" style="s2">talking about don&#39;t you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.440" end="00:29:10.279" style="s2">force it if you can just do it I said if</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.600" end="00:29:12.350" style="s2">you can expand and enrich your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.279" end="00:29:14.539" style="s2">and so you&#39;re getting that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.350" end="00:29:16.909" style="s2">being really deeply involved in your</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.539" end="00:29:21.380" style="s2">introspective flow that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.180" end="00:29:55.810" style="s2">every few days and then it gets tense</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.520" end="00:29:58.510" style="s2">and tight and it&#39;s starting to cut off</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.810" end="00:30:00.040" style="s2">your breath root and relax and fall back</p>
