<p begin="00:00:45.650" end="00:00:51.019" style="s2">emerged out of the stoah one is steel</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.519" end="00:00:53.390" style="s2">the culture and the other is seduced the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.019" end="00:00:55.150" style="s2">culture and rave and I are gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.390" end="00:00:57.170" style="s2">conversation and then we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.150" end="00:00:59.720" style="s2">pivot to a group conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.170" end="00:01:03.140" style="s2">activities Raven hasn&#39;t more knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.720" end="00:01:09.380" style="s2">about this so I will let Raven kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.140" end="00:01:14.780" style="s2">speak a little bit more about that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.380" end="00:01:18.740" style="s2">gonna do a check-in - oh yeah I feel a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.780" end="00:01:27.160" style="s2">little jittery I&#39;m excited to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.740" end="00:01:31.330" style="s2">this and I feel calm okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.160" end="00:01:33.530" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna talk about these two</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.330" end="00:01:35.390" style="s2">ideas that have been floating around</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.530" end="00:01:38.030" style="s2">different conversations in the stoechas</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.390" end="00:01:39.260" style="s2">they&#39;ve been thread throughout many of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.030" end="00:01:43.550" style="s2">the discussions that have been happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.260" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">here and we thought that we would use</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.550" end="00:01:47.570" style="s2">some of the skills that we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:50.659" style="s2">from some of the wisdom gym practices</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.570" end="00:01:53.540" style="s2">for example Socratic speed-dating to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.659" end="00:01:58.760" style="s2">kind of investigate the possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.540" end="00:02:04.060" style="s2">these of these ideas so I&#39;m gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.760" end="00:02:06.670" style="s2">by asking Peter about steal the culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.060" end="00:02:12.470" style="s2">can you tell me where that came from</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.670" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">sure so my good buddy John rebecky</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.470" end="00:02:17.209" style="s2">I think the first week that the stoah</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:19.430" style="s2">was launched over a month ago now he</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.209" end="00:02:22.010" style="s2">came and did a session on the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.430" end="00:02:27.799" style="s2">Kairos sort like a meaning opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.010" end="00:02:29.390" style="s2">that we have during this endemic and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.799" end="00:02:30.380" style="s2">sourced the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.390" end="00:02:31.670" style="s2">questions to the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.380" end="00:02:32.960" style="s2">of the group when someone asks like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.670" end="00:02:35.140" style="s2">wonderful question I can&#39;t remember who</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.960" end="00:02:37.580" style="s2">what it was but I think it was Joe and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.140" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">John just like when I&#39;ll fire you got</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.580" end="00:02:41.690" style="s2">passionate and he said he wants to steal</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">the culture from the people who have</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.690" end="00:02:46.520" style="s2">been abusing us for so long and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.060" end="00:02:48.230" style="s2">who I was delicious and something about</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.520" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">it is really really resonated with me</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.230" end="00:02:54.740" style="s2">this phrase steal the culture so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:56.330" style="s2">where it originated from and then my</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.740" end="00:02:57.590" style="s2">journal entries and then sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.330" end="00:03:00.440" style="s2">these sessions we&#39;ve been mentioning it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.590" end="00:03:03.080" style="s2">here and there and it became sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.440" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">unofficial till you came along or even</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.080" end="00:03:07.790" style="s2">it became like one part the unofficial</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:10.489" style="s2">motto of sort of the spirit of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.790" end="00:03:11.780" style="s2">group or the project of the stoah and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.489" end="00:03:13.610" style="s2">even the key or the dawn that guy who</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.780" end="00:03:15.860" style="s2">does this meaning wave music he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.610" end="00:03:16.670" style="s2">like make a song out of that that clip</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.860" end="00:03:18.050" style="s2">so there&#39;s actually gonna be like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.670" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">theme song now for this though which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.050" end="00:03:24.890" style="s2">pretty cool that&#39;s the the origin story</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">of steal the culture yeah so you had</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.890" end="00:03:29.000" style="s2">this like moment right where this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">kind of like insight came about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.000" end="00:03:34.220" style="s2">handle and you&#39;ve had this opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:36.079" style="s2">to kind of chip away at like what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.220" end="00:03:37.790" style="s2">might mean it&#39;s been brought into like</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.079" end="00:03:39.769" style="s2">the community space where we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.790" end="00:03:42.769" style="s2">about different elements of what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.769" end="00:03:45.290" style="s2">might mean how are you related to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.769" end="00:03:48.170" style="s2">over time and how are you relating to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.290" end="00:03:52.670" style="s2">now yeah yeah and so thinking this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.170" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">through slowly there&#39;s this like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.670" end="00:03:58.190" style="s2">think we have a culture right now I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:04:00.079" style="s2">think we have a cult at large and our</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.190" end="00:04:02.570" style="s2">culture the cultural artifacts that get</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.079" end="00:04:05.989" style="s2">created seem to me to be a service of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.570" end="00:04:09.739" style="s2">ego to prop up our ego and I think true</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.989" end="00:04:12.730" style="s2">culture keeps ego in check sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.739" end="00:04:15.170" style="s2">polices it so everyone has a healthy ego</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.730" end="00:04:19.459" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the basis of true</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.170" end="00:04:22.039" style="s2">community true communitas and so when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.459" end="00:04:24.229" style="s2">hear steal the culture I&#39;m inspired to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.039" end="00:04:28.010" style="s2">make that switch for making culture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.229" end="00:04:32.900" style="s2">service of ego and to make culture keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.010" end="00:04:35.210" style="s2">you going check and so in the stoah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.900" end="00:04:36.860" style="s2">feel real communitas real communities is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.210" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">bubbling up in our wisdom Jim and our</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.860" end="00:04:41.390" style="s2">various we space authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:43.160" style="s2">practices and I feel kind of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.390" end="00:04:44.570" style="s2">kinship and bond with people</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.160" end="00:04:48.050" style="s2">and just like for example we had</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.570" end="00:04:49.370" style="s2">something called I&#39;m not gonna be like I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.050" end="00:04:51.230" style="s2">kind of want to reinvent stoicism or</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.370" end="00:04:55.400" style="s2">give it some like soul because I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.230" end="00:04:56.660" style="s2">modern still movement lost its soul or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.400" end="00:04:58.550" style="s2">never had soul in the first place though</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.660" end="00:05:00.920" style="s2">that&#39;d be my argument and so just like</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.550" end="00:05:03.380" style="s2">like how do we practice those ISM let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.010" style="s2">advance you can sound like an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.600" end="00:05:19.430" style="s2">great but you just let the words flow</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.950" end="00:06:29.390" style="s2">speak to a place where the Stoics come</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.780" end="00:06:31.460" style="s2">together yeah originally the original</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.390" end="00:06:33.620" style="s2">Stoics got their name from a stoic okay</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.450" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">philosophizing and then so they got the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.490" end="00:06:44.600" style="s2">name Stoics because of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:47.300" style="s2">that&#39;s the same spirit of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.600" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">digital campfire is that we&#39;re just Co</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.300" end="00:06:51.250" style="s2">hearing together and dialoguing but</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.770" end="00:06:54.729" style="s2">what&#39;s most important at the nice edge</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.250" end="00:06:57.129" style="s2">yeah so I think another element of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.729" end="00:07:00.879" style="s2">what I saw emerging in the Congress</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.129" end="00:07:02.050" style="s2">around steal the culture was maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.879" end="00:07:07.149" style="s2">question about whether or not it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.050" end="00:07:09.219" style="s2">kind of in maybe kind of masculine or a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.149" end="00:07:11.619" style="s2">wrongful spirit you know the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.219" end="00:07:13.029" style="s2">stealing as being something that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.619" end="00:07:16.539" style="s2">something we would even consider the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.029" end="00:07:19.869" style="s2">others to be doing so I think in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.539" end="00:07:23.050" style="s2">ways that was how the the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.869" end="00:07:25.539" style="s2">seduced the culture what that was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.050" end="00:07:28.179" style="s2">yeah so let me just take the question of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.539" end="00:07:30.129" style="s2">role away from you know I I would be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.179" end="00:07:31.389" style="s2">questioner and just the preface at</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.129" end="00:07:33.219" style="s2">though yes there&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.389" end="00:07:34.929" style="s2">masculine almost a fuck you energy to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.219" end="00:07:37.469" style="s2">steal the culture that kind of like has</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.929" end="00:07:41.619" style="s2">that to me is sort of righteous do mos</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.469" end="00:07:42.879" style="s2">but if you just like have it sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.619" end="00:07:45.009" style="s2">complemented by something a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.879" end="00:07:48.819" style="s2">more archetypical feminine then I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.009" end="00:07:50.679" style="s2">it could be kind of comic book ish so</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.819" end="00:07:53.319" style="s2">that&#39;s when you when we were talking at</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.679" end="00:07:55.300" style="s2">this was thing a couple weeks ago called</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.319" end="00:07:56.949" style="s2">emancipate the daemon session you just</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.300" end="00:08:00.369" style="s2">came up with seduce the culture knows</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.949" end="00:08:01.839" style="s2">that all something&#39;s here so my question</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.369" end="00:08:03.699" style="s2">to you Raven is what do you what do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.839" end="00:08:07.119" style="s2">mean or what did you mean when you mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.699" end="00:08:10.569" style="s2">when you said seduced a culture yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.119" end="00:08:13.449" style="s2">think in many ways like just like your</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.569" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">experience there was this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.449" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">sometimes you just say something and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:21.339" style="s2">rings and I I think I&#39;ve had a similar</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:24.129" style="s2">process and also there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.339" end="00:08:26.019" style="s2">like it was a call in response right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.129" end="00:08:29.019" style="s2">like there was steal the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.019" end="00:08:31.059" style="s2">that set up a kind of structure kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.019" end="00:08:33.219" style="s2">orientation but it was incomplete in</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.059" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">some way I needed something to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.219" end="00:08:37.689" style="s2">responded to and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:41.380" style="s2">also very much in line with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.689" end="00:08:44.889" style="s2">like architect or feminine and seduce</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.380" end="00:08:50.769" style="s2">the culture I think was to speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.889" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">element of being in inviting or to work</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.769" end="00:08:55.630" style="s2">indirectly in order to draw people to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:58.660" style="s2">you and much of the way that a fire</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.630" end="00:09:00.699" style="s2">draws people you know the fire in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.660" end="00:09:03.490" style="s2">darkness is something that catches your</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.699" end="00:09:07.800" style="s2">eye and Orient&#39;s you across a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.490" end="00:09:11.110" style="s2">towards the possibility of others and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.800" end="00:09:14.950" style="s2">you&#39;re not stealing anyone&#39;s fire too</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.110" end="00:09:15.790" style="s2">around the campfire but I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.950" end="00:09:18.130" style="s2">way that I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.790" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">stealing has been much more along with</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.130" end="00:09:23.560" style="s2">like the trickster ology you know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:26.650" style="s2">Alexander bard was bringing right this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.560" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">idea of a form on the road that takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.650" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">many names and you know as your as your</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:33.220" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:37.780" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m gonna use this metaphor just</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.220" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s so useful you have something</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.780" end="00:09:41.290" style="s2">valuable to you you know you have you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:44.350" style="s2">have something with you something of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.290" end="00:09:46.450" style="s2">home and in that in that way you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.350" end="00:09:48.700" style="s2">true wealth but you meet someone on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.450" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">road and they&#39;re like hey why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.700" end="00:09:54.970" style="s2">trade the thing that you love for</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:56.200" style="s2">something that I could give you and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.970" end="00:09:57.580" style="s2">know that thing they&#39;re like hey yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.200" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">it&#39;ll be great it&#39;ll give you returns</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.580" end="00:10:02.290" style="s2">everyday it&#39;ll make your walk so much</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:05.410" style="s2">easier and you trade the thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.290" end="00:10:07.510" style="s2">have for this thing that the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.410" end="00:10:11.410" style="s2">person has and then you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.510" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">it&#39;s fake and I think that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.410" end="00:10:13.960" style="s2">happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">like we&#39;re realizing the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.960" end="00:10:20.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve traded is fake it&#39;s cheap</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:23.320" style="s2">abundance and when crisis hits cheap</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.530" end="00:10:25.510" style="s2">abundance doesn&#39;t bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.320" end="00:10:29.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing we&#39;ve actually traded</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:32.290" style="s2">for it and so I think stealing is a as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.740" end="00:10:34.830" style="s2">recognition of where we are which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.290" end="00:10:37.450" style="s2">having had something stolen from us and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.830" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">we have to we have to steal it back</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.450" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">mmm-hmm yeah I like that and so am I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.420" style="s2">getting this from what you just said is</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:48.760" style="s2">that like it&#39;s almost like a Trojan</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.420" end="00:10:50.620" style="s2">horse or bait-and-switch you got to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.760" end="00:10:52.090" style="s2">got to play the spectacled game or in</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.620" end="00:10:54.970" style="s2">Gaeta bores notion of respectability I</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.090" end="00:10:56.470" style="s2">play that enough so really that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.970" end="00:10:58.210" style="s2">trickster ology piece like to really</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.470" end="00:11:02.140" style="s2">steal the culture you need to at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.210" end="00:11:04.300" style="s2">pretend to seduce it yeah I think so and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.140" end="00:11:06.790" style="s2">I also think like there&#39;s an element of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.300" end="00:11:08.380" style="s2">like seduction that&#39;s about signaling</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.790" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">like there&#39;s an element of it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.380" end="00:11:13.150" style="s2">I&#39;m in direct communication with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:17.110" style="s2">outside and transmitting things across</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.150" end="00:11:20.080" style="s2">distances and like we have to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.110" end="00:11:22.330" style="s2">through this medium that has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.080" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.330" end="00:11:26.860" style="s2">characters involved in the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">acts and behaves like the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.860" end="00:11:32.230" style="s2">that we live with in order to signal to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:34.830" style="s2">one another of honest like you no</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.230" end="00:11:37.960" style="s2">intention to be in community are</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.830" end="00:11:40.420" style="s2">corrupted and so you have to move</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.960" end="00:11:43.380" style="s2">through the medium of the spectacle but</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.420" end="00:11:46.090" style="s2">to do so is to invite a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.380" end="00:11:47.830" style="s2">characters into your communication and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.090" end="00:11:49.330" style="s2">this create I mean Daniel Stockton</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.830" end="00:11:51.070" style="s2">burger talks about this in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.330" end="00:11:54.280" style="s2">war on sense making right like he talks</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.070" end="00:11:56.860" style="s2">about this distortion in our information</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.280" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">ecology so there is true signal there</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.860" end="00:11:59.320" style="s2">are communities and I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:00.730" style="s2">John rabe is going to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.320" end="00:12:02.260" style="s2">this this week there are communities who</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.730" end="00:12:04.420" style="s2">are transmitting clear signals to one</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.260" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">another and in times of crisis they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.420" end="00:12:08.380" style="s2">able to like Milan ate those connections</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">that they already have in order to flow</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.380" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">resources between one another but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:15.310" style="s2">know the infrastructure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:17.080" style="s2">building is through online platforms</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.310" end="00:12:20.290" style="s2">because we&#39;re decentralized you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.080" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">we&#39;re all over the world and when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.290" end="00:12:26.770" style="s2">investigate and you use the tools of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:29.890" style="s2">this domain you also risk you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.770" end="00:12:33.790" style="s2">getting lost in all the noise right</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.890" end="00:12:36.010" style="s2">right and it&#39;s coming to mind is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.790" end="00:12:38.980" style="s2">my previous analysis on the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.010" end="00:12:40.660" style="s2">how in this noosphere the collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.980" end="00:12:41.980" style="s2">mind or social media internet what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.660" end="00:12:43.810" style="s2">want to call it there&#39;s these minute</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.980" end="00:12:47.880" style="s2">medic tribes sort of like philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.810" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">in the wild that so people have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.880" end="00:12:52.990" style="s2">almost an addiction to memes and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.320" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">throwing memes at each other sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.990" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">active like propositional violence but</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:58.180" style="s2">there&#39;s like a disembodied quality I</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:12:59.770" style="s2">find with that and I don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.180" end="00:13:03.340" style="s2">win the culture by winning the culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.770" end="00:13:05.430" style="s2">war we have to do it a different way so</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.340" end="00:13:09.510" style="s2">that&#39;s where the the trickster comes in</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.430" end="00:13:12.550" style="s2">or the seductress and I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.510" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">getting the mimetic tribes in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.550" end="00:13:17.590" style="s2">where we sync them to become the body</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:19.450" style="s2">tribes well I think this is like the</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.450" end="00:14:20.060" style="s2">course there&#39;s some value to that like</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.030" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">we all live in the value of that but at</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.060" end="00:14:25.880" style="s2">the same time it&#39;s coming at a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:28.190" style="s2">so I think thinking about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.880" end="00:14:31.280" style="s2">things together we&#39;re in a we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.190" end="00:14:33.560" style="s2">complex orientation right now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.280" end="00:14:36.350" style="s2">lot of possibility and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.560" end="00:14:40.280" style="s2">risk and I think that&#39;s where the</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.280" end="00:14:44.600" style="s2">culture like that that line is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:46.610" style="s2">knife&#39;s edge yeah because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.600" end="00:14:48.620" style="s2">just a risk if you kind of lean on one</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.610" end="00:14:50.840" style="s2">and not the other and allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.620" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">balance each other and I&#39;ll say this and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.840" end="00:14:53.240" style="s2">maybe we should pivot because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.280" style="s2">lot of good comments and the chatbox</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.240" end="00:14:58.270" style="s2">will pivot to the kind of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.280" end="00:15:00.890" style="s2">portion but I&#39;ll say this it&#39;s like I</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.660" end="00:15:11.690" style="s2">rebrand it first or so I&#39;m just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.250" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">taking it and putting it on stoicism is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.690" end="00:15:15.260" style="s2">being in right relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.510" style="s2">and you can say being in right</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.260" end="00:15:19.550" style="s2">relationship with God or being depending</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.510" end="00:15:20.690" style="s2">on your metaphysics but I really like</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.690" end="00:15:23.630" style="s2">reality and in being right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:25.310" style="s2">with reality we got to be in right</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.130" end="00:15:38.540" style="s2">know this moment right here you know and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:40.790" style="s2">then that&#39;s where community toss is</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.540" end="00:15:42.650" style="s2">found and that&#39;s where true beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.790" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">found in my opinion and if we can get</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.650" end="00:15:46.610" style="s2">this right I think we&#39;re developing an</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:48.090" style="s2">organic wisdom gym that will promote</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.610" end="00:15:50.490" style="s2">this community oz feeling</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.830" end="00:16:03.420" style="s2">you thank you so we want to give</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.600" end="00:16:06.420" style="s2">everybody an opportunity to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.420" end="00:16:10.200" style="s2">each other and let&#39;s see depending on</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.420" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">how many people are in the group 29 so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.200" end="00:16:15.780" style="s2">yeah we were thinking maybe groups of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:17.190" style="s2">four and in for those of you who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.780" end="00:16:19.290" style="s2">done Socratic speed-dating I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.190" end="00:16:21.810" style="s2">give a little debrief about what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.290" end="00:16:25.740" style="s2">looks like so typically we would break</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.810" end="00:16:27.270" style="s2">into groups of two for the for that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.740" end="00:16:29.910" style="s2">exercise but for this one we&#39;ll do four</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.270" end="00:16:32.130" style="s2">and for eight minutes you&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.910" end="00:16:36.360" style="s2">room with other folks and in this case</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.130" end="00:16:37.500" style="s2">we&#39;ll be discussing the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.360" end="00:16:40.770" style="s2">have been at the center of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.500" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">conversation you go back and forth about</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.770" end="00:16:46.920" style="s2">the questions and then we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:48.150" style="s2">and debrief maybe do another one or we</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.920" end="00:16:50.910" style="s2">might do an open conversation at that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.150" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">point as well so I think in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.910" end="00:16:55.770" style="s2">questions if anybody wants to share a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">question that they may have in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.770" end="00:17:01.140" style="s2">as a possible resource for others in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:05.430" style="s2">room that&#39;s totally fine but I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.140" end="00:17:08.490" style="s2">just prompt with a few ideas that could</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.430" end="00:17:11.100" style="s2">be the point of conversation one would</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.490" end="00:17:14.130" style="s2">be just generally what do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.100" end="00:17:18.150" style="s2">seduce what does that mean and steal the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.130" end="00:17:21.330" style="s2">culture do you contest the terminology</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.150" end="00:17:23.510" style="s2">are there things that it illuminates and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.330" end="00:17:26.100" style="s2">things that itch that it shields and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.510" end="00:17:27.450" style="s2">what do you think of the things what are</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.100" end="00:17:29.130" style="s2">the things that have arisen out of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.450" end="00:17:33.960" style="s2">conversation so that would be my</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.130" end="00:17:36.410" style="s2">provocation and I will put you on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.960" end="00:17:36.410" style="s2">group&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:30.619" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">how about we just kind of like maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.749" end="00:19:35.299" style="s2">the private chat you can kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:36.590" style="s2">reflect on who would you like to speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.299" end="00:19:39.350" style="s2">in your group and whoever feels called</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:41.239" style="s2">can maybe speak on behalf of it and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.350" end="00:19:46.820" style="s2">came up Kyle so that&#39;s so much juiciness</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.239" end="00:19:49.940" style="s2">came up in ours so uh so we had wond</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.820" end="00:19:52.100" style="s2">Donna and Tito and on our group and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.940" end="00:19:53.389" style="s2">Donna was saying how the seduce the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.100" end="00:19:55.399" style="s2">culture it&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.389" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">something that you want when you when</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.399" end="00:19:59.299" style="s2">you and you&#39;re trying to seduce and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.669" style="s2">same thing can be said of steel and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.299" end="00:20:02.840" style="s2">cheeto rightfully said said you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.669" end="00:20:04.279" style="s2">what we&#39;re not trying to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.840" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">current culture or seduced the current</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.279" end="00:20:08.029" style="s2">culture we might be stealing or seducing</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:10.399" style="s2">like that the metaphysical version of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.029" end="00:20:12.200" style="s2">culture but proposition that was more</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.399" end="00:20:15.559" style="s2">accurate is reimagining the culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.200" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">which I agreed with then once a like but</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.559" end="00:20:19.909" style="s2">there&#39;s some like correctness in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:22.580" style="s2">attitude of wanting to steal the culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.909" end="00:20:23.690" style="s2">and seduce the culture which I thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.580" end="00:20:25.159" style="s2">was delicious because he&#39;s an artist</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.690" end="00:20:28.850" style="s2">right as we has that artists attitude</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.159" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">and then Donna said when she felt into</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.850" end="00:20:32.149" style="s2">that there&#39;s sort of like a pain and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:33.529" style="s2">hurt and that that attitude and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.149" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">that sentence because you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.529" end="00:20:38.679" style="s2">longing for culture and and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:40.999" style="s2">that what came up is sort of like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.679" end="00:20:43.100" style="s2">bait and switch or a Trojan horse you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.999" end="00:20:44.929" style="s2">know like that statement that attitude</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.100" end="00:20:47.629" style="s2">that has sort of a correctness about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.929" end="00:20:49.700" style="s2">could speak to that pain in people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.629" end="00:20:51.590" style="s2">miss culture and then bring them in and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.700" end="00:20:53.419" style="s2">then as sort of our duty as being good</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.590" end="00:20:55.009" style="s2">Stoics to actually have some distance</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.419" end="00:20:56.450" style="s2">from that pain so we don&#39;t indulge in it</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.009" end="00:20:58.279" style="s2">and so we can actually have genuine</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.450" end="00:20:59.690" style="s2">communitas here so that was sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.279" end="00:21:01.249" style="s2">organic discussion that happened between</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.690" end="00:21:04.850" style="s2">the four of us and there was more but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.249" end="00:21:05.359" style="s2">thought that was really really rich yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.850" end="00:21:09.739" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.359" end="00:21:11.119" style="s2">yeah our conversation I think also</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.739" end="00:21:13.580" style="s2">danced around what were the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.119" end="00:21:16.710" style="s2">of this view and I think that that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.580" end="00:21:21.749" style="s2">really valuable in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.710" end="00:21:25.259" style="s2">dan and Daniel and mimetic we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.749" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">talking about attention being maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.259" end="00:21:30.119" style="s2">more tangible tactile way of viewing</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:34.019" style="s2">what it is that we&#39;re actually playing</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.119" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">with because to steal or to seduce</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.019" end="00:21:40.289" style="s2">points to a kind of active attention</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:42.419" style="s2">I mean stealing I mean for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.289" end="00:21:44.970" style="s2">effective is really like you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.419" end="00:21:46.980" style="s2">draw attention to one thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.970" end="00:21:50.610" style="s2">while the attention is being drawn you</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.980" end="00:21:53.789" style="s2">take right so attention is being played</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.610" end="00:21:55.590" style="s2">with in this case there&#39;s a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.789" end="00:22:00.570" style="s2">the terminology I think is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.590" end="00:22:02.549" style="s2">abstract like culture is kind of a term</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.570" end="00:22:05.369" style="s2">that a lot of people have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.549" end="00:22:08.340" style="s2">different interpretations of and also</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.369" end="00:22:11.759" style="s2">that steal and seduce are words that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.340" end="00:22:14.820" style="s2">come from the old world the old</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.759" end="00:22:16.440" style="s2">vocabulary and that&#39;s kind of where we</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.820" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">went with the conversation and I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.440" end="00:22:19.980" style="s2">definitely invite any of any of those</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">guys to come and speak for their</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.980" end="00:22:25.499" style="s2">thoughts on that case and also for</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:28.019" style="s2">everybody else if you would like to move</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.499" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">I&#39;m in gallery for you but I&#39;ll move to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.019" end="00:22:33.379" style="s2">grid view and then maybe we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:36.119" style="s2">our hands and just share what we think</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.379" end="00:22:38.879" style="s2">if you&#39;d like to yeah Daniel would you</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.119" end="00:22:40.860" style="s2">like to unmute yourself yeah I might</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.879" end="00:22:43.259" style="s2">take away from that which I might not</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.860" end="00:22:46.230" style="s2">necessarily be representing everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.259" end="00:22:48.059" style="s2">comments well but is that there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.230" end="00:22:50.149" style="s2">like to tactical fronts that we could</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.059" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">take with the idea of the culture and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.149" end="00:22:54.210" style="s2">what I understood nomadic to say was</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.190" style="s2">that we can think of a culture as</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.210" end="00:22:57.450" style="s2">attention which is more tangible but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.190" end="00:22:59.220" style="s2">like it what Dan said as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.450" end="00:23:01.559" style="s2">culture is kind of like an implicit set</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.220" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">of principles that and the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.559" end="00:23:04.679" style="s2">that share those principles and those</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">two things have very distinct flavors</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.679" end="00:23:09.539" style="s2">although you can kind of see how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:15.090" style="s2">they&#39;re connected so that was my summary</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.539" end="00:23:18.049" style="s2">of that conversation does anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.090" end="00:23:18.049" style="s2">want to speak for their group</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.460" end="00:23:29.750" style="s2">yeah James our group was heard some of I</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:31.309" style="s2">think what you or maybe maybe those</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.750" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">Peter who just came back and started</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.309" end="00:23:37.940" style="s2">with that where steal and seduced both</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:39.770" style="s2">kind of imply that this is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.940" end="00:23:43.130" style="s2">that&#39;s been taken and needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.770" end="00:23:45.230" style="s2">returned to rightful owners or other</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.130" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">owners and like you know what is this</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.230" end="00:23:49.549" style="s2">Amorphis thing that&#39;s been taken and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.320" style="s2">can you can you steal it and do we want</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.549" end="00:23:54.770" style="s2">to be stealing things like you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.320" end="00:23:57.260" style="s2">before we broke out and tort and towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.770" end="00:24:03.169" style="s2">the end we kind of came around to sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.260" end="00:24:05.450" style="s2">of a you know even seduction as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.169" end="00:24:06.770" style="s2">like through all talking before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.450" end="00:24:10.760" style="s2">kind of implied it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.770" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">softer maybe like form of stealing you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.760" end="00:24:14.590" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s some there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:16.850" style="s2">nuance to it maybe but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.590" end="00:24:22.460" style="s2">there&#39;s still these elements of coercion</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.850" end="00:24:24.770" style="s2">and like reducing the agency of whoever</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.460" end="00:24:27.159" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re doing that to so we kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.770" end="00:24:29.539" style="s2">of talked about seduction in like</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.159" end="00:24:31.460" style="s2">seduction is you know certainly welcomed</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.539" end="00:24:32.899" style="s2">in some context right like maybe you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.460" end="00:24:38.450" style="s2">been seduced by someone you were glad</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.899" end="00:24:39.950" style="s2">you were seduced by but that still means</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.450" end="00:24:45.529" style="s2">that you know you did something you</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.950" end="00:24:47.149" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to do something there I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.529" end="00:24:48.620" style="s2">like to respond to that and I opened up</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.149" end="00:24:52.130" style="s2">this proposition of your stress testing</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.620" end="00:24:53.539" style="s2">is it&#39;s sort of like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.130" end="00:24:55.490" style="s2">difference between the letter of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.539" end="00:24:57.110" style="s2">mean meme the letter of the mean and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.490" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">spirit of the mean all right the letter</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.110" end="00:25:00.529" style="s2">of the meme there&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:02.179" style="s2">concerned with propositional accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.529" end="00:25:04.220" style="s2">and so steal the culture pseudo so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.179" end="00:25:05.809" style="s2">cultures wrong in that sense it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.220" end="00:25:07.130" style="s2">more like what Tito said reimagining the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.809" end="00:25:09.649" style="s2">culture or something that&#39;s more game B</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.130" end="00:25:11.510" style="s2">ish but there&#39;s sort of like the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.649" end="00:25:13.070" style="s2">spirit of that mean steal the culture to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.510" end="00:25:15.080" style="s2">seduce the culture that has an actuating</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.070" end="00:25:16.370" style="s2">element to it that has to flirt like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.080" end="00:25:19.490" style="s2">thumos that makes you want to create</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.370" end="00:25:21.320" style="s2">something in the world so I could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.490" end="00:25:23.149" style="s2">wrong but I sensed that having that nice</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.320" end="00:25:26.690" style="s2">edge of the balance between having</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.149" end="00:25:28.520" style="s2">fidelity to the letter of the meme but</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.690" end="00:25:31.220" style="s2">still embracing at least on a felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.520" end="00:25:35.070" style="s2">level that spirit</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.220" end="00:25:37.140" style="s2">yeah it could be the case though for for</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.070" end="00:25:39.120" style="s2">some those are like rallying calls and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.140" end="00:25:42.180" style="s2">for others there&#39;s still a question</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.120" end="00:25:45.270" style="s2">about what that actually means and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.180" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.270" end="00:25:50.370" style="s2">like really massage these these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:53.070" style="s2">because I think in a way it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.370" end="00:25:56.340" style="s2">terminology is referencing itself in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.070" end="00:25:58.380" style="s2">sense that the idea I mean what does</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.340" end="00:26:02.100" style="s2">seduction arise from what a stealing</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.380" end="00:26:04.220" style="s2">come from if we think of those things of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.100" end="00:26:06.360" style="s2">as being virtues that have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.220" end="00:26:09.240" style="s2">corrupted in some way to become</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.360" end="00:26:11.510" style="s2">seduction or become stealing then in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.240" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">sense we&#39;re trying to steal back and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.510" end="00:26:19.530" style="s2">seduce back stealing and seducing but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:23.340" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.530" end="00:26:25.230" style="s2">punches a little bit harder I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.340" end="00:26:29.160" style="s2">interested in breaking out again and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.230" end="00:26:31.980" style="s2">maybe we can discuss that question what</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.160" end="00:26:35.280" style="s2">are some other possibilities and I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.980" end="00:26:37.230" style="s2">ask everybody to have in their mind the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.280" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">idea that they would maybe come back and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.230" end="00:26:43.920" style="s2">share with the group some of those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:46.910" style="s2">while we break out so I will send us a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.920" end="00:26:46.910" style="s2">send us out again</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.800" end="00:26:59.350" style="s2">it&#39;ll be eight minutes again but with</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.540" end="00:26:59.350" style="s2">different people</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.820" end="00:27:17.980" style="s2">see him hello hi Peter how&#39;s it going</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.330" end="00:27:19.410" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.980" end="00:27:21.370" style="s2">we had another really great session</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.410" end="00:27:23.640" style="s2">excellent yeah we had a really good</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.370" end="00:27:29.790" style="s2">session too we actually came up with</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.640" end="00:27:33.660" style="s2">potentially another idea let&#39;s hear it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.790" end="00:27:37.330" style="s2">subvert the culture mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.660" end="00:27:39.280" style="s2">doing well and I would totally invite</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.330" end="00:27:41.380" style="s2">anybody from my group to jump in at any</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.280" end="00:27:44.980" style="s2">point if you want to clarify some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.380" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">things that you said but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.980" end="00:27:49.750" style="s2">ideas that Sandra was bringing forth was</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.230" end="00:27:51.610" style="s2">this idea of like art you know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.750" end="00:27:53.890" style="s2">really art that just grabs you is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.610" end="00:27:56.290" style="s2">subversive in some way like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.890" end="00:27:59.530" style="s2">and subversive in the sense that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.290" end="00:28:02.530" style="s2">it&#39;s like not expected and in that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.530" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">it it does maybe kind of you could use</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.530" end="00:28:06.460" style="s2">the metaphor it steals something from</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.460" end="00:28:16.050" style="s2">but subversion is kind of like the more</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.930" end="00:28:19.480" style="s2">value neutral tactical way of getting at</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.050" end="00:28:22.650" style="s2">the concept that we may use steel or</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.480" end="00:28:26.980" style="s2">seduce to point to interact indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.650" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">how&#39;s that land it lands well I want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.980" end="00:28:32.410" style="s2">tap in my boy Mac night Billy he said</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.700" end="00:28:34.540" style="s2">something similar because he&#39;s an artist</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.410" end="00:28:36.250" style="s2">in Toronto he just really like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.540" end="00:28:37.750" style="s2">interesting stuff here and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.250" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">it back can I put you on the spot and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.750" end="00:28:45.790" style="s2">then talk about beauty and art oh man</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:49.390" style="s2">yeah sure I think yeah I was just</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.790" end="00:28:53.650" style="s2">thinking yeah surprise is huge huge art</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.390" end="00:28:56.950" style="s2">and and in subversion for sure and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.650" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">were talking about the seductive value</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.950" end="00:29:05.920" style="s2">in beauty and that art work is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:08.440" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s a philosophy in what</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.920" end="00:29:10.510" style="s2">beauty is and it&#39;s a decentralised</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.440" end="00:29:13.060" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s something that you feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.510" end="00:29:15.730" style="s2">through the senses that that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.060" end="00:29:19.540" style="s2">necessarily coming to you in these</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.730" end="00:29:21.880" style="s2">ready-made packets it kind of flows</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.540" end="00:29:25.260" style="s2">outside of that that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.880" end="00:29:25.260" style="s2">talking about briefly</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.160" end="00:29:41.420" style="s2">any other artists in the room who</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.450" end="00:29:42.460" style="s2">resonate with that idea I have another</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.420" end="00:29:46.070" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.460" end="00:29:48.680" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a heart like lately</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.070" end="00:29:51.140" style="s2">I think a lot about how four to four</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.680" end="00:29:53.030" style="s2">artists missing right now said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.140" end="00:29:55.220" style="s2">not a common language to it I think a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.030" end="00:29:57.260" style="s2">good art always came from a culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.220" end="00:29:59.240" style="s2">where there was a common language people</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.260" end="00:30:00.560" style="s2">shared they allowed to create things</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.240" end="00:30:02.510" style="s2">like a sort of me message</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.560" end="00:30:05.720" style="s2">I was thinking yours about this group</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.510" end="00:30:07.310" style="s2">here and I&#39;m sure that everyone here is</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.720" end="00:30:09.980" style="s2">very different you know way but was all</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.310" end="00:30:14.570" style="s2">here I&#39;m sure that we don&#39;t share a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.980" end="00:30:16.250" style="s2">common language at all and I wonder like</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.570" end="00:30:19.310" style="s2">I wonder what is this community of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.250" end="00:30:21.620" style="s2">people that have probably some things in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.310" end="00:30:24.230" style="s2">common but also not a lot in common and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.620" end="00:30:26.840" style="s2">what can that community create no way</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.230" end="00:30:28.550" style="s2">how can they find language to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.840" end="00:30:30.980" style="s2">each other because that&#39;s how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.550" end="00:30:32.600" style="s2">what I feel and I don&#39;t know I only</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.980" end="00:30:33.980" style="s2">didn&#39;t a couple of these meetings but</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.600" end="00:30:36.590" style="s2">the feeling that I get is that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.980" end="00:30:38.840" style="s2">here is very different but they also</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.590" end="00:30:41.030" style="s2">have something that holding us together</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.840" end="00:30:43.850" style="s2">so I was thinking about that like how</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.030" end="00:30:45.320" style="s2">people who have something in common but</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.850" end="00:30:47.870" style="s2">maybe not a lot in common</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.320" end="00:30:50.060" style="s2">could create a language together or find</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.870" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">like a sort of meta language to play</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.060" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">with oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.140" end="00:30:58.870" style="s2">thank you yeah I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.070" end="00:31:01.690" style="s2">actually one of the big challenges of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.870" end="00:31:04.270" style="s2">our era is that you know there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.690" end="00:31:06.280" style="s2">different kinds of memes that were</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.270" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">attracted to and I think that that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.280" end="00:31:12.460" style="s2">largely maybe the spirit of the half</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:15.490" style="s2">that is seduced right like there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.460" end="00:31:18.850" style="s2">idea in seduction of attraction and of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.490" end="00:31:20.620" style="s2">signaling and of like that being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.850" end="00:31:24.250" style="s2">how signals are mediated right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.620" end="00:31:26.590" style="s2">kind of perception of distance in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.250" end="00:31:28.750" style="s2">signal allows you to kind of orient</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.590" end="00:31:31.450" style="s2">towards something that&#39;s away from you</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.750" end="00:31:34.540" style="s2">and in that sense it also attracts you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.450" end="00:31:35.850" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know something that that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.540" end="00:31:39.610" style="s2">was thinking of when you were talking is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.850" end="00:31:40.780" style="s2">you know stealing and seducing and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.610" end="00:31:42.630" style="s2">even some of the other language that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.780" end="00:31:45.340" style="s2">we&#39;re using around the stoah has</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.630" end="00:31:48.550" style="s2">Christian themes to it in some ways and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.340" end="00:31:51.070" style="s2">I think that certainly there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.550" end="00:31:54.010" style="s2">move that I&#39;ve seen some philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.070" end="00:31:56.350" style="s2">make towards you explicitly kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.010" end="00:31:59.350" style="s2">maybe even reappropriation language that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.350" end="00:32:02.290" style="s2">is Christian in a sense because it it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.350" end="00:32:04.360" style="s2">does have a wide reach I mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.290" end="00:32:06.580" style="s2">give it give that to Christianity and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.360" end="00:32:09.160" style="s2">has a wide reach and so there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.580" end="00:32:12.070" style="s2">that there is also it as a religion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.160" end="00:32:17.410" style="s2">compounded over time this kind of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.070" end="00:32:19.660" style="s2">that is not necessarily on the surface</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.410" end="00:32:21.610" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.660" end="00:32:26.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like how DNA carries around a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.610" end="00:32:28.330" style="s2">of extra stuff I think are our stories</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.290" end="00:32:30.010" style="s2">that we&#39;ve carried for a long time have</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.330" end="00:32:33.510" style="s2">that as well and you may not realize</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.010" end="00:32:36.220" style="s2">that a story in an old book holds a seed</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.510" end="00:32:38.050" style="s2">for something else that may get you</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.220" end="00:32:40.180" style="s2">through crisis that you don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.050" end="00:32:42.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s a one and a 500-year event</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.180" end="00:32:45.750" style="s2">or one in a thousand year then rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.400" end="00:32:45.750" style="s2">than something that happens every year</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.530" end="00:32:53.490" style="s2">anyone else feel invited to speak on</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.570" end="00:32:53.490" style="s2">behalf of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.010" end="00:33:00.450" style="s2">I want to help regulate something dan</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.980" end="00:33:02.820" style="s2">said in the first chat which is coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.450" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">to mind right now where you use the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.820" end="00:33:07.770" style="s2">phrase build and I think it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:10.620" style="s2">like a nice counterpoint to all this</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.770" end="00:33:12.810" style="s2">there&#39;s seduce there&#39;s steal but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.620" end="00:33:17.210" style="s2">also build the culture and I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.810" end="00:33:19.590" style="s2">that brings up anything for anyone yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.210" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">yeah I remember dan said something I</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.590" end="00:33:23.070" style="s2">built a stoah about like kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:25.500" style="s2">actually used the metaphor of the stoah</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.070" end="00:33:26.910" style="s2">of kind of like a can you can you talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.500" end="00:33:31.470" style="s2">on that again I think that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.910" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">really brilliant yeah sure yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.470" end="00:33:34.650" style="s2">it was the idea we were talking it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:37.770" style="s2">under the the context of building the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.650" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">store and we were talking and use it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.770" end="00:33:42.570" style="s2">trying to understand what you meant by</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">scaling so there&#39;s scaling it internally</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.570" end="00:33:48.840" style="s2">as one instantiation of one digital</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:52.620" style="s2">campfire and then there&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.840" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">building it out as in bunches of digital</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.620" end="00:33:58.740" style="s2">campfires across the landscape and so in</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:01.130" style="s2">the context of a bunch of digital</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.740" end="00:34:04.140" style="s2">campfires across the landscape the stoah</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.130" end="00:34:06.570" style="s2">is kind of an open forum just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.140" end="00:34:09.030" style="s2">pillars and there are no doors or walls</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.570" end="00:34:14.820" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of an open space</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.030" end="00:34:17.340" style="s2">technology where if one wants to one can</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.820" end="00:34:20.520" style="s2">jump one can wander across the field and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.340" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">jump into one stoa or and and then go to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.520" end="00:34:24.629" style="s2">another stoah and and people from other</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:27.000" style="s2">stoas or other campfires are welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.629" end="00:34:30.050" style="s2">Brewers and vice versa that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.000" end="00:34:30.050" style="s2">what I was communicating</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.339" end="00:34:38.149" style="s2">excellent and then we have mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.639" end="00:34:40.550" style="s2">cheaper job yeah so I wanted to say I</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.149" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">mean we&#39;re using afraid steal the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.550" end="00:34:45.079" style="s2">culture it&#39;s not exactly the culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:47.690" style="s2">that we want to steal because you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.079" end="00:34:49.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not like we want to become the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.690" end="00:34:52.429" style="s2">Donald Trump that&#39;s not exactly the goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.550" end="00:34:53.629" style="s2">right but so what we&#39;re actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.429" end="00:34:55.490" style="s2">to do is more along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.629" end="00:34:58.550" style="s2">building the culture but to build it we</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.490" end="00:35:00.550" style="s2">have to steal the materials and one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.550" end="00:35:02.570" style="s2">the important materials is attention</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.550" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.570" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">that&#39;s probably brought its way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:09.560" style="s2">saying and I mean authority or</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:12.500" style="s2">legitimacy those are types of attention</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.560" end="00:35:16.520" style="s2">right or sacredness is a type of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.500" end="00:35:19.670" style="s2">attention and so that&#39;s what has to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.520" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">stolen and my thinking is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.670" end="00:35:25.640" style="s2">the the old style culture like game a or</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:30.310" style="s2">whatever that&#39;s um that&#39;s already in</p>
