<p begin="00:05:01.560" end="00:05:07.540" style="s2">adjacent to seeing the stoic emerge</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.950" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">obviously lots of people I respect been</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.540" end="00:05:11.920" style="s2">on here this is my first one to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:15.610" style="s2">get to participate in myself my</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.920" end="00:05:17.620" style="s2">understanding is that it&#39;s not sharing</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.610" end="00:05:19.180" style="s2">things that we have kind of have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.620" end="00:05:20.290" style="s2">decent sense of having figured out but</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.180" end="00:05:23.169" style="s2">things that were kind of on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.290" end="00:05:26.980" style="s2">figuring out ourselves and so Peter you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.169" end="00:05:28.870" style="s2">had asked me what is a topic I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.980" end="00:05:30.910" style="s2">interested in and contemplating at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.870" end="00:05:34.300" style="s2">moment I think you phrased it as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.910" end="00:05:37.900" style="s2">road to a Damon but so yeah that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.300" end="00:05:39.640" style="s2">the converting Moloch from SIF to Jedi</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.900" end="00:05:42.550" style="s2">was the first thought that came up or I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.640" end="00:05:45.130" style="s2">think I also said something like how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.550" end="00:05:47.410" style="s2">close evolutionary niches for sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.130" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">and predatory predatory expressions of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.410" end="00:05:53.770" style="s2">sociopathy this is definitely a primary</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:57.400" style="s2">topic on my mind right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:06:00.130" style="s2">I I&#39;m not sure if everybody on here is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:03.070" style="s2">familiar with the term Moloch used in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.130" end="00:06:05.260" style="s2">the way that like it was defined in</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.070" end="00:06:07.000" style="s2">meditations on Moloch from slate start</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.260" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">codex I&#39;ve talked about it that way</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.000" end="00:06:14.790" style="s2">other times if not all do a basic</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:21.700" style="s2">definition anyone not familiar with it</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.790" end="00:06:26.610" style="s2">okay before I just kind of dive in Peter</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.700" end="00:06:26.610" style="s2">fill any thing else for context</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.700" end="00:06:33.880" style="s2">not on my end what do you think Phil</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.310" end="00:06:36.900" style="s2">yeah not am I and I think the good to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.880" end="00:06:36.900" style="s2">define Moloch</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.200" end="00:06:43.030" style="s2">so Moloch is a if you haven&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.640" end="00:06:45.580" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.030" end="00:06:47.950" style="s2">Google meditations on Moloch slates are</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.580" end="00:06:50.890" style="s2">codex it&#39;s a brilliant beautiful article</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.950" end="00:06:53.320" style="s2">it&#39;s describing multipolar traps but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.890" end="00:06:55.510" style="s2">a way that gives both good grounded</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.320" end="00:06:57.610" style="s2">examples and nice poetry to it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.510" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">multipolar trap basically is a game</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.610" end="00:07:03.730" style="s2">theoretic situation where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.110" end="00:07:05.500" style="s2">number of players where if any of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.730" end="00:07:07.750" style="s2">defects it creates an incentive for</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.500" end="00:07:09.070" style="s2">everybody else to defect defect on some</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.750" end="00:07:10.750" style="s2">type of agreement that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.070" end="00:07:13.770" style="s2">create a better global optimum for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.750" end="00:07:17.230" style="s2">whole but each person&#39;s own local</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.770" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">optimum would have them defect on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.230" end="00:07:22.030" style="s2">whole but then you get a race to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:24.370" style="s2">bottom and in other words if anyone does</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.030" end="00:07:25.930" style="s2">something that is kind of really bad for</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.370" end="00:07:27.790" style="s2">the Commons and bad for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.930" end="00:07:29.950" style="s2">long-term but provides a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.790" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">near-term advantage for them they just</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.950" end="00:07:34.870" style="s2">win so everyone else then to not lose</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:39.100" style="s2">has to race to do that thing faster and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.870" end="00:07:40.780" style="s2">an arms race is a classic example so if</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.100" end="00:07:43.060" style="s2">anybody builds the new type of weapon</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.780" end="00:07:44.410" style="s2">and anyone else says no that weapons</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.060" end="00:07:46.600" style="s2">fucked we shouldn&#39;t have chemical</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.410" end="00:07:48.580" style="s2">weapons or biological weapons or AI</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.600" end="00:07:50.830" style="s2">automated killing weapons and whoever</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.580" end="00:07:53.200" style="s2">builds them just wins everything runs</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.830" end="00:07:55.330" style="s2">the world so anybody builds a fucked-up</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.200" end="00:07:57.220" style="s2">weapon and now everybody has to race to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.330" end="00:07:59.260" style="s2">build that weapon plus counter weapons</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.220" end="00:08:03.010" style="s2">plus better versions of that weapon</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.260" end="00:08:05.470" style="s2">faster so that&#39;s a kind of arms race</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.010" end="00:08:07.510" style="s2">example tragedy of the Commons is</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.470" end="00:08:09.850" style="s2">another kind of classic example anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.510" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">does something that externalizes more of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.850" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">the cost to the Commons they figure out</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.730" style="s2">some mining method that maybe leaves a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:17.920" style="s2">lot more tailings or mountaintop removal</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.730" end="00:08:20.140" style="s2">or whatever but it increases margins and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.920" end="00:08:22.150" style="s2">opens up new markets whoever does that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.140" end="00:08:23.590" style="s2">will economically beat out the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.150" end="00:08:25.630" style="s2">aren&#39;t doing it so then everybody races</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.590" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">to do the more extractive polluting</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.630" end="00:08:30.190" style="s2">externalizing thing and you&#39;re left with</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:31.720" style="s2">no forests and no fish and toxic</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.190" end="00:08:33.790" style="s2">tailings in the water and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.720" end="00:08:36.010" style="s2">thing so a race to the bottom there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.790" end="00:08:38.170" style="s2">simple way of thinking about it so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.010" end="00:08:39.940" style="s2">of people when they think about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.170" end="00:08:41.500" style="s2">underneath all the problems in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.940" end="00:08:45.190" style="s2">they start to think about social</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.500" end="00:08:47.470" style="s2">architectures and so one of the social</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.190" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">architectures is this kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.470" end="00:08:54.840" style="s2">theoretic race to the bottom type</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:57.550" style="s2">scenario where a very small number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.840" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">sociopaths or sadists or assholes can</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.550" end="00:09:01.960" style="s2">create a game dynamic that then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:05.590" style="s2">else has obligated to not just play but</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.960" end="00:09:11.080" style="s2">try to play to win and we see this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.590" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">actually playing out right like the UN</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.080" end="00:09:16.120" style="s2">was created out of World War two to try</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">and prevent nuclear proliferation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.120" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">then has had the primary goal of nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:22.060" style="s2">deep proliferation and we have way more</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:23.800" style="s2">countries with way faster nukes now than</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.060" end="00:09:25.900" style="s2">we did then it&#39;s like why have we failed</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.800" end="00:09:27.910" style="s2">so profoundly at being able to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.900" end="00:09:32.740" style="s2">of nukes because who wants to give up</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.910" end="00:09:35.170" style="s2">their last nuke first like no nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.740" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">stupid and and how do we know if the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.170" end="00:09:37.960" style="s2">other guys actually gave up their last</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:38.890" style="s2">nuke or if they&#39;re saying they gave up</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.960" end="00:09:43.240" style="s2">their last nuke and they&#39;re just hiding</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.890" end="00:09:45.400" style="s2">one and so it becomes very hard to share</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.240" end="00:09:47.320" style="s2">the optics necessary to get the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.400" end="00:09:49.840" style="s2">agreement so if we don&#39;t give up all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.320" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">nukes then we actually say ok we fuck it</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.840" end="00:09:54.790" style="s2">we&#39;ve got nukes I can actually win</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:56.440" style="s2">mutually assured destruction if my nukes</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.790" end="00:09:58.330" style="s2">are way faster and I can win first</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.440" end="00:10:00.490" style="s2">strike so the entire Cold War was a race</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.330" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2">between Soviet and US military</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">manufactured for hypersonic missiles to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.100" end="00:10:08.230" style="s2">see can we make faster and faster nukes</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:10.180" style="s2">and right now the main one is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.230" end="00:10:14.860" style="s2">massive arms races and cyber weaponry</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s massive arms races in obviously</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.860" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">bio but AI is the really big one</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:25.150" style="s2">autonomous weapons so how do we get out</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.400" end="00:10:26.650" style="s2">of that is a big question and and we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.150" end="00:10:28.450" style="s2">see a bunch of examples when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.650" end="00:10:33.060" style="s2">about tragedy of the Commons it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.450" end="00:10:36.370" style="s2">just environmental Commons it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.060" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">epistemic and emotional common some news</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.370" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">agency figures out how to use more</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">inflammatory salacious headlines that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:45.010" style="s2">hijack your limbic nervous system better</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:46.330" style="s2">and more people just open that shit</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.010" end="00:10:48.760" style="s2">because it actually worked and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.330" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">like I want to know you know Trump</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.760" end="00:10:53.180" style="s2">eviscerate somebody or whatever like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">words that that hit some</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.180" end="00:10:57.320" style="s2">evolutionary trigger and then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:00.830" style="s2">is racing to have the most salacious</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.320" end="00:11:02.210" style="s2">headlines and compress the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.830" end="00:11:06.350" style="s2">into the shortest number of bullet</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.210" end="00:11:08.180" style="s2">points and whatever and then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.350" end="00:11:10.670" style="s2">just a race for who has the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.180" end="00:11:12.650" style="s2">headlines it will create a clique but</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.670" end="00:11:17.870" style="s2">who has the delivery platforms that can</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.650" end="00:11:19.550" style="s2">micro targets the most addictive ones to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.870" end="00:11:22.190" style="s2">you personally right so then this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.550" end="00:11:25.340" style="s2">what Facebook and Google and Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.190" end="00:11:26.470" style="s2">the large platforms in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.340" end="00:11:29.000" style="s2">each other are doing is actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.470" end="00:11:30.830" style="s2">competing for time on site and attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.000" end="00:11:35.570" style="s2">across the scope of everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.830" end="00:11:36.950" style="s2">attention better and I&#39;m sure everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.570" end="00:11:38.450" style="s2">in here knows that if you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.950" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">familiar with work like the work of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.450" end="00:11:42.860" style="s2">Tristan Harris you should definitely</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.810" style="s2">become familiar with it but if you look</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.860" end="00:11:47.870" style="s2">at your Facebook feed it&#39;s nothing at</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.810" end="00:11:49.160" style="s2">all like the Facebook feed of someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.870" end="00:11:51.770" style="s2">with slightly different views and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.160" end="00:11:54.110" style="s2">aesthetics and preferences because the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.770" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">total number of things that you can see</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.110" end="00:11:57.350" style="s2">in your Facebook feed represents a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.450" style="s2">trillionth of a percent of all the shit</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.350" end="00:12:00.710" style="s2">on facebook so how is it determining</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.450" end="00:12:02.300" style="s2">what goes in your feet well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.710" end="00:12:04.010" style="s2">determining it based on the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.300" end="00:12:06.650" style="s2">will make you stay on the site longest</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.010" end="00:12:10.070" style="s2">not just based on what you actually hit</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.650" end="00:12:11.660" style="s2">like but how long your mouse hovers and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.070" end="00:12:14.930" style="s2">how long your eye hovers and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.660" end="00:12:17.690" style="s2">over all kinds of things and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.930" end="00:12:22.040" style="s2">the quotes that one of the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.690" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">Tristan particularly likes and I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.040" end="00:12:26.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a very important one is that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:30.500" style="s2">kinds of AIS that optimize your newsfeed</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.660" end="00:12:33.890" style="s2">or higher power AI is in the AIS that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.500" end="00:12:35.390" style="s2">beat Kasparov at chess and to just get a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.890" end="00:12:37.190" style="s2">sense of how much fucking better</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.390" end="00:12:38.960" style="s2">Kasparov is at chest and you aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.960" end="00:12:43.730" style="s2">he knows that he&#39;s playing right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.700" end="00:12:45.410" style="s2">beat him just so clearly and easily you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.730" end="00:12:46.730" style="s2">have AI is better than that beating you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.410" end="00:12:48.500" style="s2">at the allocation of your own attention</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.730" end="00:12:49.910" style="s2">and you don&#39;t even realize you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.500" end="00:12:53.840" style="s2">engaged in such a warfare and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.910" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">getting to use fear and tribalism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.840" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">sex and money and desire and food and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:01.190" style="s2">every fucking hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:03.140" style="s2">possible and so it optimizes you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.190" end="00:13:05.390" style="s2">newsfeed for those things so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.140" end="00:13:05.910" style="s2">information ecology gets destroyed in</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:16.740" style="s2">the if they&#39;re gonna cut the trees down</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.180" end="00:13:18.330" style="s2">there won&#39;t be trees anyways even if I</p>

<p begin="00:15:09.000" end="00:15:15.430" style="s2">look at boström sperms the idea if</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.870" end="00:15:19.900" style="s2">if people aren&#39;t familiar I&#39;ll do a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.430" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">short version of this in the book super</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.900" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">intelligence where Nick Bostrom laid out</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:27.010" style="s2">AI risk there&#39;s like not one AI risk</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:28.900" style="s2">scenario there&#39;s a million AI risk</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.010" end="00:15:31.240" style="s2">scenarios because it&#39;s not just things</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.900" end="00:15:34.810" style="s2">look like terminator it&#39;s also things</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.240" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">that look like Google that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.810" end="00:15:39.610" style="s2">increasing or in conflict because of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:41.290" style="s2">polarization because of news feeds and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.610" end="00:15:43.000" style="s2">tribalism which is stuff like Peter</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.290" end="00:15:44.770" style="s2">talks about these mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.000" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">actually are getting more distinct and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.770" end="00:15:48.930" style="s2">more separate partly because of platform</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:48.930" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.850" end="00:15:58.590" style="s2">so with the paperclip Maximizer bostrom</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.640" end="00:16:00.540" style="s2">laid out one very simple scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.590" end="00:16:03.300" style="s2">you could have an AI that kills</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.540" end="00:16:05.130" style="s2">everything and basically the gist is you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.300" end="00:16:06.900" style="s2">have this AI that like being able</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.130" end="00:16:08.820" style="s2">getting trained on chess to beat</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.900" end="00:16:10.290" style="s2">Kasparov they&#39;re being trained on go to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.820" end="00:16:12.690" style="s2">be the best go player</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.290" end="00:16:15.000" style="s2">it&#39;s trained on optimizing a supply</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.690" end="00:16:16.410" style="s2">chain and that&#39;s like the actual useful</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.000" end="00:16:17.610" style="s2">shit we want to do with a eyes right we</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.410" end="00:16:18.900" style="s2">want to make them more efficient and be</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.610" end="00:16:25.020" style="s2">able to do shit like optimize supply</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.900" end="00:16:28.520" style="s2">agents so we make a AI that has sensor</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.020" end="00:16:33.450" style="s2">input all along the supply chain and say</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.520" end="00:16:34.950" style="s2">make more paper clips and or widgets of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.450" end="00:16:37.170" style="s2">whatever kind cars whatever but paper</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.950" end="00:16:38.580" style="s2">clip in the analogy so it starts</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.170" end="00:16:42.210" style="s2">figuring out how to decrease in</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.580" end="00:16:44.820" style="s2">efficiencies and how to turn the lights</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.210" end="00:16:46.710" style="s2">off because it&#39;s kidding it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.820" end="00:16:48.420" style="s2">humans in the space while it&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.710" end="00:16:50.580" style="s2">and the electricity costs go back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.420" end="00:16:51.780" style="s2">substrate and whatever and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.580" end="00:16:53.280" style="s2">actually seems like an environmentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.780" end="00:16:56.640" style="s2">good thing because it&#39;s more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.280" end="00:16:59.340" style="s2">but as you fast-forward the scenario if</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.640" end="00:17:02.040" style="s2">it has an optimization function for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.340" end="00:17:03.570" style="s2">narrow metric like more paper clips then</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.040" end="00:17:04.980" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a point at which it is made</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.570" end="00:17:07.260" style="s2">all the paper clips it can with its</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.980" end="00:17:08.820" style="s2">existing substrate and now it has to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.260" end="00:17:10.680" style="s2">more substrate so now it has to make new</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.820" end="00:17:13.380" style="s2">mines to get more metal to make it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.680" end="00:17:15.089" style="s2">then it has to actually compete with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.380" end="00:17:16.650" style="s2">people that want to use that for other</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.089" end="00:17:18.330" style="s2">materials but it can out-compete them</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.650" end="00:17:21.180" style="s2">and on and on until eventually it turns</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.330" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">the whole world into paper clips because</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.180" end="00:17:25.020" style="s2">if it can and all the paper clip</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:27.780" style="s2">Maximizer needs to do this is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.020" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">ability to optimize some function and to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.780" end="00:17:31.890" style="s2">get better to get more intelligent at</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">its ability to do that so recursive</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.890" end="00:17:35.940" style="s2">intelligence and an optimization</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.950" style="s2">function can kill everything so long as</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.940" end="00:17:40.500" style="s2">its ability to get better at it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.950" end="00:17:44.690" style="s2">faster than our ability if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.500" end="00:17:44.690" style="s2">like what it was doing to beat it right</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.140" end="00:17:54.650" style="s2">so one can say that capitalism writ</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:57.000" style="s2">large is a paper clip Maximizer and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.650" end="00:17:58.770" style="s2">capitalism is obviously inanimate but</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.000" end="00:18:00.930" style="s2">this AI might be inanimate</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.770" end="00:18:04.020" style="s2">right the AI is an algorithm it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.930" end="00:18:04.980" style="s2">consciousness but it is an optimization</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.600" end="00:18:09.540" style="s2">recursive veterans that meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.190" end="00:18:16.740" style="s2">exponentially better well if you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.540" end="00:18:19.020" style="s2">about capitalism I I&#39;m hearing comments</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.740" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">not too much time on all this all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.020" end="00:18:27.809" style="s2">well we&#39;re almost framed up with what</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">Moloch is so capitalism is the process</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.809" end="00:18:34.110" style="s2">of being able to take a single metric</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:36.330" style="s2">which is a dollar or a piece of fiat</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.110" end="00:18:38.730" style="s2">currency of whatever kind or currency of</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">services and but of course as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.690" end="00:18:52.679" style="s2">you understand that the interest on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:54.299" style="s2">monetary supply requires an exponential</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.919" end="00:19:03.419" style="s2">which requires increase in extraction</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.780" end="00:19:07.020" style="s2">and all those things you start to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.419" end="00:19:09.419" style="s2">realize that capitalism as a whole is</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.140" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of value like I</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:24.660" style="s2">appreciate the feeling of sunshine or I</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.059" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">gradient descent and capitalism is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.830" end="00:20:30.549" style="s2">one instantiation communism and other</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:32.109" style="s2">things actually we&#39;re all so different</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.549" end="00:20:34.389" style="s2">and sensations of the paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.109" end="00:20:36.519" style="s2">Maximizer as was their competition with</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.389" end="00:20:40.029" style="s2">each other and so the gist as you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.519" end="00:20:42.100" style="s2">say unbounded rival risk game theory as</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.029" end="00:20:45.070" style="s2">a whole is the essence of more walk</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.100" end="00:20:48.940" style="s2">right Moloch is the emergent property of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.070" end="00:20:50.669" style="s2">unbounded of basically game theory by</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.940" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">creatures that have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.669" end="00:20:56.409" style="s2">exponentiate their capacity to do so</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:59.409" style="s2">which through the ability to do tool</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.409" end="00:21:05.019" style="s2">creation and buy tools I mean physical</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.409" end="00:21:06.879" style="s2">tools and social tools so I could say</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.019" end="00:21:11.320" style="s2">that everything that I&#39;m focused on is</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.879" end="00:21:12.789" style="s2">is how to kill Moloch which is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.320" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">generator function of all those other</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.789" end="00:21:17.109" style="s2">things but you don&#39;t actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:19.299" style="s2">kill it right so this was this topic of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.109" end="00:21:21.999" style="s2">being able to convert Moloch from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.299" end="00:21:25.629" style="s2">dark side to the light side which is can</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.999" end="00:21:28.419" style="s2">you actually it&#39;s a funny concept that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.629" end="00:21:30.100" style="s2">if you if you read what Aleister Crowley</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.419" end="00:21:32.769" style="s2">got obsessed with for a while and has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.100" end="00:21:34.330" style="s2">study of the occult many occult</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.769" end="00:21:36.789" style="s2">traditions have this idea that one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.330" end="00:21:39.639" style="s2">the highest things you can do is summon</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.789" end="00:21:41.350" style="s2">a demon and convert it to an angel and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.639" end="00:21:42.909" style="s2">we see mythos everywhere about like</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.350" end="00:21:45.970" style="s2">Darth Vader be you know doing the good</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.909" end="00:21:47.710" style="s2">act right at the very end so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.970" end="00:21:51.759" style="s2">I just I was thinking about is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.710" end="00:22:05.230" style="s2">fun idea if we just just say that Moloch</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.759" end="00:22:08.049" style="s2">in essence is game theory it is some</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.230" end="00:22:09.419" style="s2">agents it&#39;s different agents that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.049" end="00:22:12.519" style="s2">optimize their own well-being</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.419" end="00:22:15.940" style="s2">differentially to each other where any</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.519" end="00:22:18.659" style="s2">innovation that any of them do leads to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.940" end="00:22:22.059" style="s2">the other ones needing to innovate in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.659" end="00:22:24.489" style="s2">relevant or commensurate direction that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.059" end="00:22:26.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to only be gradient descent</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.489" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">it can also be gradient ascend you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.710" end="00:22:31.539" style="s2">engineer races to the top where someone</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:32.440" style="s2">conduced something that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.539" end="00:22:37.690" style="s2">better for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.440" end="00:22:40.540" style="s2">long term and that actually creates</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.690" end="00:22:43.540" style="s2">near-term adaptive advantage they</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.540" end="00:22:45.700" style="s2">creates an incentive for other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.540" end="00:22:48.790" style="s2">organizations companies to do things</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:52.090" style="s2">that are also following that similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.790" end="00:22:55.150" style="s2">trend so the question of how do you make</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.090" end="00:22:58.330" style="s2">things and so what one way we can think</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.150" end="00:23:02.440" style="s2">about Morlock also is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.330" end="00:23:03.880" style="s2">near-term short-term schism of that what</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.440" end="00:23:05.560" style="s2">is good for the long term we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.880" end="00:23:06.910" style="s2">actually do because we&#39;ll lose in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.560" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">short and medium term if we do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.910" end="00:23:09.730" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have enough resource</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:13.300" style="s2">and that there are things that provide</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.730" end="00:23:14.650" style="s2">near-term benefit and this is like okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.300" end="00:23:16.570" style="s2">so I cut down the tree I get immediate</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.650" end="00:23:19.240" style="s2">material advantage from doing so if I</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.570" end="00:23:20.770" style="s2">don&#39;t cut down the tree yes there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.240" end="00:23:22.780" style="s2">forests for great-grandchildren</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.770" end="00:23:26.110" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t increase my power to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.780" end="00:23:27.460" style="s2">or affect anything and thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.110" end="00:23:29.140" style="s2">as an individual me cutting down the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.460" end="00:23:31.750" style="s2">tree doesn&#39;t affect trees writ large all</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.140" end="00:23:33.430" style="s2">that much but everybody doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.750" end="00:23:38.320" style="s2">then racing to do it faster actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.430" end="00:23:39.430" style="s2">really does so the question becomes how</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.320" end="00:23:42.130" style="s2">do we identify</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.430" end="00:23:45.910" style="s2">directions that are better for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.130" end="00:23:48.160" style="s2">long term that are actually viable in</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.910" end="00:23:49.750" style="s2">the near term in the presence of rival</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.160" end="00:23:52.270" style="s2">risk competition still happening or</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.750" end="00:23:54.070" style="s2">embedded within that context now we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.270" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">start to get into a bunch of examples of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.070" end="00:23:58.650" style="s2">how that can happen but that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:23:58.650" style="s2">angry</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.500" end="00:24:12.650" style="s2">cool so we&#39;ll put it to the QA filled</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.540" end="00:24:15.960" style="s2">you want to frame that for us yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.650" end="00:24:20.760" style="s2">um so thank you Daniel for that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.960" end="00:24:25.650" style="s2">introduction so now we&#39;re gonna pivot to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.760" end="00:24:29.390" style="s2">a Q&amp;A section how I work is please write</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.650" end="00:24:34.140" style="s2">down your questions in the chat box and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.390" end="00:24:38.850" style="s2">I will call upon you to a mute and ask</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.140" end="00:24:41.160" style="s2">your questions if and just a reminder</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.850" end="00:24:45.960" style="s2">this is being recorded so if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.160" end="00:24:48.150" style="s2">want your question to be for you to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.960" end="00:24:56.790" style="s2">the questions I can read that on your</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.150" end="00:25:00.150" style="s2">behalf so to get things started off I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.790" end="00:25:02.670" style="s2">gonna first ask a few questions as we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.150" end="00:25:07.170" style="s2">hope to collect that collective</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.670" end="00:25:14.340" style="s2">intelligence here in the crowd so for</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.170" end="00:25:19.160" style="s2">Daniel what would you say is one example</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.340" end="00:25:25.260" style="s2">that you&#39;re seeing today around upwards</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.160" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">gradient up ascent or what are the like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.260" end="00:25:35.280" style="s2">the seeds that you&#39;re seeing happening</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:39.870" style="s2">in the world in this direction there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.280" end="00:25:44.700" style="s2">some classic ones musk in electric cars</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.870" end="00:25:47.160" style="s2">is a very classic one and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.700" end="00:25:49.350" style="s2">very interesting to see why that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.160" end="00:25:53.510" style="s2">case related to the short term medium</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.350" end="00:25:53.510" style="s2">term long term thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.090" end="00:26:05.000" style="s2">because of the PayPal exit he was he</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:07.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to be beholden to venture</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.000" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">capital or put a little bit of money</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.070" end="00:26:12.980" style="s2">that created immediate ROI on money so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:14.059" style="s2">he could do some extended R&amp;D it</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.980" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been able to happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.059" end="00:26:17.960" style="s2">otherwise that was actually the key</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:20.120" style="s2">thing was that he was able to not have</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.960" end="00:26:22.429" style="s2">to use his immediate resources to just</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.120" end="00:26:23.659" style="s2">keep getting immediate resources which</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.429" end="00:26:26.059" style="s2">is the hamster wheel he had enough</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.659" end="00:26:29.299" style="s2">resource that he was able to do R&amp;D to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.059" end="00:26:31.850" style="s2">create a new spot on the map and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.299" end="00:26:34.520" style="s2">idea of full-stack integration of can we</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.850" end="00:26:36.230" style="s2">really make a more efficient battery and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.520" end="00:26:38.539" style="s2">a more you know efficient electric car</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.230" end="00:26:40.039" style="s2">as a whole and then once he does that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.539" end="00:26:41.270" style="s2">becomes obvious that it&#39;s both a doable</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.039" end="00:26:43.250" style="s2">and a desirable thing and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.270" end="00:26:45.020" style="s2">other car manufacturers realize they</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.250" end="00:26:47.169" style="s2">become obsolete unless they also do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.020" end="00:26:50.299" style="s2">and now you have everybody racing to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.169" end="00:26:52.309" style="s2">electric cars better in a way that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.299" end="00:26:54.740" style="s2">really weren&#39;t before right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.309" end="00:26:56.330" style="s2">the kind of a and that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.740" end="00:26:58.010" style="s2">electric cars don&#39;t have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.330" end="00:27:00.620" style="s2">problems with the material acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.010" end="00:27:02.330" style="s2">of the base metals needed to make the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.620" end="00:27:06.980" style="s2">batteries and a bunch of other shit but</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.330" end="00:27:08.419" style="s2">it&#39;s a good example of a a new race that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.980" end="00:27:10.039" style="s2">is happening that is at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.419" end="00:27:13.549" style="s2">directionally right in some critical</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.039" end="00:27:16.669" style="s2">ways that wasn&#39;t I would even say that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.549" end="00:27:18.740" style="s2">like the long form intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.669" end="00:27:22.309" style="s2">podcasting thing of which this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.740" end="00:27:25.010" style="s2">derivative that let&#39;s say Tim Ferriss</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.309" end="00:27:28.520" style="s2">and Joe Rogan kind of pioneered which</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.010" end="00:27:32.120" style="s2">was almost an a counter movement to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.520" end="00:27:33.649" style="s2">sound bites and tweets and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.120" end="00:27:36.200" style="s2">entertainment only which is let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.649" end="00:27:38.450" style="s2">long-form conversation let&#39;s do low</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.200" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">production value but higher authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.450" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">and let&#39;s actually explore some topics</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:47.990" style="s2">and depth started becoming a desirable</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.610" style="s2">enough thing that a lot of people did</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.990" end="00:27:51.620" style="s2">that now you&#39;ve got Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.610" end="00:27:53.750" style="s2">interviewing Roger Penrose about exotic</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.620" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">physics and people are actually watching</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.750" end="00:28:00.520" style="s2">and that was just not a thing a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:28:00.520" style="s2">while ago right so that&#39;s a cool example</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.580" end="00:28:08.690" style="s2">I&#39;m mostly interested in examples that</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">the worst problems where we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.460" end="00:28:15.900" style="s2">change topologies of markets to solve</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:17.640" style="s2">very large-scale problems where the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.900" end="00:28:18.779" style="s2">topology of markets are currently and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.640" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">causing the problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.779" end="00:28:23.429" style="s2">which means being able to change the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:25.590" style="s2">incentive landscape so when you think</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.429" end="00:28:29.970" style="s2">about the way that Soros shorted the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.590" end="00:28:33.809" style="s2">pound he actually changed the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.970" end="00:28:35.460" style="s2">of an entire hmm and he changed the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.809" end="00:28:38.190" style="s2">topology of an incentive landscape</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.460" end="00:28:40.230" style="s2">because pounds were worth less relative</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.190" end="00:28:41.669" style="s2">to other forms of currency after he did</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.230" end="00:28:43.590" style="s2">that well that required him having a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.669" end="00:28:45.630" style="s2">certain kind of Intel he had to know</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.590" end="00:28:47.610" style="s2">that there was a sustainably inflated</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.630" end="00:28:49.230" style="s2">Pound valuation and that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.610" end="00:28:51.149" style="s2">self-correcting and then he had to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.230" end="00:28:52.620" style="s2">enough money he had to be a whale right</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.149" end="00:28:54.419" style="s2">enough money under management at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.620" end="00:28:55.649" style="s2">they by shorting it hard enough he</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.419" end="00:28:57.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t just lose all his money he</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.649" end="00:28:59.429" style="s2">actually signaled something that made</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.000" end="00:29:01.230" style="s2">the marquetry correct which meant he had</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.429" end="00:29:03.809" style="s2">Devin both had enough sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.230" end="00:29:05.429" style="s2">enough actuation capacity and the sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.809" end="00:29:06.779" style="s2">making could see the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.429" end="00:29:09.270" style="s2">correct something in actuation capacity</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.779" end="00:29:10.620" style="s2">could act on it well there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.270" end="00:29:12.120" style="s2">places where there are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.620" end="00:29:14.130" style="s2">bad for the world environmentally or</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.120" end="00:29:16.770" style="s2">whatever that are only barely profitable</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.130" end="00:29:18.270" style="s2">but at scale still profitable and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.770" end="00:29:20.669" style="s2">could make them more expensive through a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.270" end="00:29:22.289" style="s2">number of means and there are things</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.669" end="00:29:24.390" style="s2">that are not quite profitable and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.289" end="00:29:26.130" style="s2">is kind of what Elon showed but if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.390" end="00:29:27.659" style="s2">could get economy of scale over a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.130" end="00:29:29.640" style="s2">certain threshold or you change the</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.640" end="00:29:34.590" style="s2">for in particular ways or you change</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.890" end="00:29:36.690" style="s2">legislation in certain ways you can make</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.590" end="00:29:38.010" style="s2">those things more profitable this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.690" end="00:29:40.049" style="s2">like not a new idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.010" end="00:29:41.610" style="s2">but the idea of being able to use the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.049" end="00:29:43.350" style="s2">right kind of sense making so</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.610" end="00:29:48.830" style="s2">intelligence combined with the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.350" end="00:29:51.480" style="s2">kind of high scale financial capacities</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.830" end="00:29:53.549" style="s2">most of the time the groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.480" end="00:29:55.289" style="s2">focused on let&#39;s benefit the environment</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.549" end="00:29:57.690" style="s2">don&#39;t create massive private equity</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.289" end="00:29:59.370" style="s2">funds and hedge funds and dark pools to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.690" end="00:30:02.429" style="s2">say how do we change the topology of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.370" end="00:30:04.169" style="s2">Finance writ large and so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.429" end="00:30:07.169" style="s2">being able and the people that do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.169" end="00:30:09.659" style="s2">do it for almost exclusively personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.169" end="00:30:12.630" style="s2">gain extractive traditional Moloc</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.659" end="00:30:15.510" style="s2">purposes but those Moloc tools that can</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.630" end="00:30:17.190" style="s2">change the topology of markets in a way</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.510" end="00:30:19.649" style="s2">that then moves what everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.190" end="00:30:20.970" style="s2">incentive to do can also be used to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.649" end="00:30:23.280" style="s2">create races to the top where they</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.970" end="00:30:24.780" style="s2">aren&#39;t currently being implemented</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.280" end="00:30:27.540" style="s2">so I can give you an example when it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.780" end="00:30:28.290" style="s2">comes to the Amazon if you want but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.540" end="00:30:39.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know if there are other questions</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.290" end="00:30:43.010" style="s2">first huh I would love to actually hear</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.450" end="00:30:47.700" style="s2">about the Amazon the one or maybe later</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.010" end="00:30:49.650" style="s2">if if people feel called I am really</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.700" end="00:30:51.450" style="s2">enjoying the fact that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.650" end="00:30:54.600" style="s2">collective intelligence happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.450" end="00:30:57.690" style="s2">chat so if people want to hear that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.600" end="00:31:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not just my own personal interest</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.690" end="00:31:01.980" style="s2">in the Amazon then people can share that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.240" end="00:31:05.190" style="s2">in the chat I do want to let people know</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.980" end="00:31:06.840" style="s2">that we have Daniel here until 8:30 in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.190" end="00:31:10.770" style="s2">case people were wondering this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.840" end="00:31:13.530" style="s2">whether this was in power long I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.770" end="00:31:16.350" style="s2">session so just to get people some time</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.530" end="00:31:20.580" style="s2">heads up and I&#39;m really appreciating all</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.350" end="00:31:22.770" style="s2">the Plus Ones so it helps me choose I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.580" end="00:31:25.980" style="s2">see what people are really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.770" end="00:31:28.590" style="s2">so I think the first question that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.980" end="00:31:33.320" style="s2">want to cut to the group will want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.590" end="00:31:36.660" style="s2">call on would be from Daniel Kazanjian</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.320" end="00:31:40.140" style="s2">hey I thinks Daniel I just have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.660" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">question for grounding this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.140" end="00:31:45.000" style="s2">in a more personal way like I love</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:46.830" style="s2">hearing about how we can resolve things</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.000" end="00:31:48.780" style="s2">at a systemic level and obviously that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.830" end="00:31:51.570" style="s2">discussion needs to be had but one</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.780" end="00:31:54.300" style="s2">takeaway that I hope to take is how I</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.570" end="00:31:55.260" style="s2">can take what you&#39;re saying and some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.300" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">the thinking around the space and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.260" end="00:32:00.690" style="s2">actually improve my relationships</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:02.430" style="s2">improves what&#39;s immediately at hand so</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.690" end="00:32:05.490" style="s2">do you have any personal ideas or</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.430" end="00:32:08.010" style="s2">examples for how this idea of moloch</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.490" end="00:32:09.450" style="s2">alchemy can apply really really locally</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.010" end="00:32:11.700" style="s2">like within your friendships or within</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.450" end="00:32:13.940" style="s2">your your marriages and family that kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.700" end="00:32:13.940" style="s2">of thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.740" end="00:32:28.220" style="s2">yes and no yes it can apply and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.690" end="00:32:29.990" style="s2">actually don&#39;t want your friendships and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.220" end="00:32:31.970" style="s2">marriages to have game theory as their</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.990" end="00:32:37.340" style="s2">primary driver no matter what even a</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.970" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">race to the top I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.340" end="00:32:41.150" style="s2">trying to out-compete my wife or who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.320" end="00:32:42.230" style="s2">nicer to each other like that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.150" end="00:32:43.640" style="s2">wrong fucking headframe</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.230" end="00:32:45.830" style="s2">so what I&#39;m talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.640" end="00:32:47.900" style="s2">converting Moloch is insofar as there</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.830" end="00:32:49.720" style="s2">are competitive relationships there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.900" end="00:32:53.750" style="s2">relationships that have real kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.720" end="00:32:56.179" style="s2">agency competition going on can we make</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.750" end="00:32:58.220" style="s2">races to the top but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.179" end="00:33:00.980" style="s2">that all action is game theory mediated</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.220" end="00:33:03.049" style="s2">the so when I&#39;m talking about converting</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.980" end="00:33:05.570" style="s2">Moloch that&#39;s actually not a game B idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.049" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a game a to game be transitional</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.570" end="00:33:09.770" style="s2">idea right game B idea is that anti</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:12.950" style="s2">rivalries relationships in which Moloch</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.770" end="00:33:18.470" style="s2">is not actually a thing the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.950" end="00:33:21.890" style="s2">kind of game theory so now if we say in</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.470" end="00:33:24.110" style="s2">your in your local environment are there</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.890" end="00:33:25.820" style="s2">plenty of rivalries relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.110" end="00:33:29.330" style="s2">can move in the right direction yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.820" end="00:33:32.120" style="s2">like having a subculture define cool</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.330" end="00:33:34.040" style="s2">differently in a way that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.120" end="00:33:41.720" style="s2">gradient ascent is actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.040" end="00:33:44.059" style="s2">fucking valuable thing to do and and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.720" end="00:33:46.280" style="s2">know and this is like basic shit but</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.059" end="00:33:49.190" style="s2">very basic principles around virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.280" end="00:33:52.250" style="s2">if there&#39;s a guy who&#39;s doing something</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.190" end="00:33:53.690" style="s2">kind of better than you and some other</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.250" end="00:33:55.429" style="s2">friends and chicks and whatever are</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.690" end="00:33:58.309" style="s2">noticing it and you feel some</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.429" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">competitive impulse don&#39;t try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.309" end="00:34:02.120" style="s2">him down ever just try to get better</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:04.070" style="s2">yourself like take it at take it as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.120" end="00:34:05.660" style="s2">impulse of the right kind of competition</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.070" end="00:34:08.510" style="s2">to be like oh I&#39;m only feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.660" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">because and you can take this two</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.510" end="00:34:10.940" style="s2">different ways I&#39;m only saying this</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:12.830" style="s2">because of some wounded childhood</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.940" end="00:34:16.929" style="s2">insecurities let&#39;s just heal that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.830" end="00:34:18.770" style="s2">also important and then so and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.929" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">because there&#39;s something I actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.770" end="00:34:24.080" style="s2">respect there and it&#39;s an in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">actually a cue for me to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.080" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an area that I value desire and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:30.710" style="s2">respect that I feel like I could step</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:31.909" style="s2">into more so that&#39;s an example of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.710" end="00:34:33.649" style="s2">positive</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.909" end="00:34:39.710" style="s2">competition or positive Moloch type</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.649" end="00:34:41.450" style="s2">dynamics if you think about the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.710" end="00:34:46.819" style="s2">rivalry from an evolutionary bio</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.450" end="00:34:49.129" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s it&#39;s survival selection</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.819" end="00:34:52.010" style="s2">and mate selection right like primarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.129" end="00:34:55.039" style="s2">those things so it&#39;s it&#39;s getting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.010" end="00:34:56.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s getting mates like that were</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.039" end="00:35:00.109" style="s2">the deepest evolutionary signal is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.780" end="00:35:02.450" style="s2">mostly those things and so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.109" end="00:35:04.339" style="s2">getting stuff is the one that has this</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.450" end="00:35:08.000" style="s2">pretty one that has this particularly</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.339" end="00:35:10.099" style="s2">unbounded characteristic in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.000" end="00:35:12.109" style="s2">where you have you&#39;re not just doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.099" end="00:35:14.869" style="s2">survival stuff but you can amass</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.109" end="00:35:17.780" style="s2">billions of dollars so we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.869" end="00:35:22.460" style="s2">about that but as far as mate selection</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.780" end="00:35:23.990" style="s2">goes you&#39;ve probably all heard various</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.460" end="00:35:25.880" style="s2">people talk about I think Brett</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.990" end="00:35:28.010" style="s2">Weinstein has probably talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.880" end="00:35:31.970" style="s2">publicly the most in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.010" end="00:35:34.520" style="s2">adjacent to this group of if women</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.970" end="00:35:36.680" style="s2">redefined what was sexy whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.520" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">answer of what they defined was is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.680" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">all guys would do because if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.170" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">this is actually kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.069" end="00:35:56.270" style="s2">I&#39;ll digress for a moment one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:58.279" style="s2">critique that Brett gave me years ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.270" end="00:35:59.869" style="s2">when we met of the sexual liberation</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.279" end="00:36:01.069" style="s2">movement I thought was actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.869" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">insightful and it was one I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.069" end="00:36:07.240" style="s2">thought of before that was with birth</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:09.859" style="s2">control we decoupled sex from</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.240" end="00:36:11.000" style="s2">procreation there&#39;s a lot that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.859" end="00:36:12.980" style="s2">awesome about that and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.000" end="00:36:14.990" style="s2">anybody wants to go back to a pre birth</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.980" end="00:36:18.890" style="s2">control world but there was also some</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.990" end="00:36:22.339" style="s2">major downsides which was it&#39;s much less</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.890" end="00:36:25.220" style="s2">costly evolutionarily for a man to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.339" end="00:36:27.289" style="s2">sex then for a woman to have sex because</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.220" end="00:36:28.760" style="s2">he possibly can have this toxic mating</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.289" end="00:36:30.319" style="s2">strategy of spread your seed and bail</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.760" end="00:36:32.210" style="s2">and she can&#39;t write like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.319" end="00:36:34.430" style="s2">something she just physiologically can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.210" end="00:36:37.190" style="s2">do so she obviously has an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.430" end="00:36:39.670" style="s2">impetus to ensure a kind of bonding that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.190" end="00:36:43.730" style="s2">can raise that child because our</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.670" end="00:36:45.140" style="s2">extended helpless neoteny and extended</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.730" end="00:36:48.019" style="s2">gestation period make it</p>

<p begin="00:36:48.019" end="00:36:57.470" style="s2">other species and that when we decoupled</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.799" end="00:36:59.329" style="s2">those when they were coupled now this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.470" end="00:37:02.150" style="s2">not exactly true and if we go back and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.329" end="00:37:04.099" style="s2">look at some cultures that had polyandry</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.150" end="00:37:05.960" style="s2">versus polygamy versus multi-male</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.099" end="00:37:07.609" style="s2">multi-female systems versus a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.960" end="00:37:10.430" style="s2">different social implementations of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.609" end="00:37:11.990" style="s2">monogamy so they&#39;ll all be different so</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.430" end="00:37:18.069" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna say a very generalized</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.990" end="00:37:20.089" style="s2">trend as a starting place here in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.069" end="00:37:23.630" style="s2">enforcement agha me through social</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.089" end="00:37:27.470" style="s2">shaming culture like much of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.630" end="00:37:35.960" style="s2">Western civilization in the Victorian</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.470" end="00:37:38.119" style="s2">age on has been at least if a woman</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.960" end="00:37:39.609" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to raise kids with a guy she</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.119" end="00:37:42.890" style="s2">also didn&#39;t wanna have sex with him</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.609" end="00:37:45.079" style="s2">because especially pre birth control she</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.890" end="00:37:47.510" style="s2">couldn&#39;t guarantee that having sex with</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.079" end="00:37:49.339" style="s2">a guy didn&#39;t result in having a baby so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.510" end="00:37:52.670" style="s2">he had to actually be good father</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.339" end="00:37:55.039" style="s2">material to get laid now good father</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.670" end="00:37:57.319" style="s2">material corresponds to good citizen</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.039" end="00:37:58.789" style="s2">much much more than just good lay</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.319" end="00:37:59.960" style="s2">correspondence a good citizen cuz the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.789" end="00:38:02.089" style="s2">guy can be a good lamb be an utter</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.960" end="00:38:04.519" style="s2">asshole but he can&#39;t actually be a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.089" end="00:38:07.609" style="s2">father and be an utter asshole good</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.519" end="00:38:08.869" style="s2">father means that he can provide and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.609" end="00:38:10.789" style="s2">can be tempered and he can stay in</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.869" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">something for a long time and he can</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.789" end="00:38:15.740" style="s2">prioritize somebody other than himself</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:18.559" style="s2">and you know father and family person</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.740" end="00:38:20.660" style="s2">and so there was something around so</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.559" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">this is then where the slut-shaming</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.660" end="00:38:24.890" style="s2">thing becomes a big deal or horse</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:28.130" style="s2">shaming and like let&#39;s make sure that no</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.890" end="00:38:29.539" style="s2">women ever fuck men outside of marriage</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.130" end="00:38:31.940" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want to create an</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.539" end="00:38:34.910" style="s2">evolutionary niche for guys who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.940" end="00:38:36.799" style="s2">assholes to get laid if a guy&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.910" end="00:38:38.839" style="s2">asshole we want to if the guy wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.799" end="00:38:42.319" style="s2">be a good father we want him to never be</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.839" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">liable so that all the men have a race</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.319" end="00:38:46.700" style="s2">to become the guy that would be a better</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.720" end="00:38:48.829" style="s2">father so women&#39;s freedom of selection</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.700" end="00:38:51.259" style="s2">is actually selecting for something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.829" end="00:38:54.170" style="s2">is good for the society right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.259" end="00:38:55.490" style="s2">very interesting kind of thing so there</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.170" end="00:38:57.410" style="s2">were actually some people who predicted</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.490" end="00:38:58.309" style="s2">that following the sexual liberation</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.410" end="00:38:59.630" style="s2">movement we</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.309" end="00:39:03.799" style="s2">get something like the pickup artists</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.630" end="00:39:06.949" style="s2">movement which is a evolutionary niche</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.799" end="00:39:12.140" style="s2">that grows for guys who are assholes who</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.949" end="00:39:16.039" style="s2">can get laid so now is this woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.140" end="00:39:17.059" style="s2">responsibility to say no there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.039" end="00:39:19.130" style="s2">multipolar trap because a particular</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.059" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">woman say okay I&#39;m not going to fuck the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.130" end="00:39:24.289" style="s2">guy who seems like a attractive bad boy</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:26.180" style="s2">whatever but wouldn&#39;t be a good father</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.289" end="00:39:27.650" style="s2">but other women still will so I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.180" end="00:39:29.900" style="s2">close the niche this is why it was not</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.650" end="00:39:32.479" style="s2">only their own behavior but the women</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.900" end="00:39:34.219" style="s2">enforcing other women type social policy</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.479" end="00:39:36.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s tricky in here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.219" end="00:39:38.959" style="s2">not going to suggest some kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.670" end="00:39:40.670" style="s2">traditionalist regressive move but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.959" end="00:39:42.890" style="s2">gonna say that the progress have moved</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.670" end="00:39:46.579" style="s2">missed a few things and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.890" end="00:39:50.029" style="s2">deeper kind of analysis has to happen so</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.579" end="00:39:54.259" style="s2">could women start reshaping using</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.029" end="00:39:55.969" style="s2">knowing that men will become that which</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.259" end="00:39:57.380" style="s2">they think will get them the best mating</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.969" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">selection whether they know it or not</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.380" end="00:40:02.119" style="s2">could women help to reshape the topology</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:02.569" style="s2">of that incentive landscape yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.119" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.569" end="00:40:07.819" style="s2">could men also help to reshape it yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:10.449" style="s2">they also could so I want to say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.819" end="00:40:16.910" style="s2">responsibility for this on both parts</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.449" end="00:40:23.900" style="s2">could guys that because a lot of guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.910" end="00:40:26.420" style="s2">might hear this as okay some beta that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.900" end="00:40:28.729" style="s2">has an issue with violence is going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.420" end="00:40:30.469" style="s2">try to convince women to be attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.729" end="00:40:31.789" style="s2">something they aren&#39;t attracted to so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.469" end="00:40:42.670" style="s2">that he can get laid right like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.789" end="00:40:44.900" style="s2">would be the argument so if men started</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.670" end="00:40:46.579" style="s2">developing what would make them</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.900" end="00:40:48.529" style="s2">attractive to women for evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.579" end="00:40:49.959" style="s2">biology purposes and what would make</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.529" end="00:40:53.420" style="s2">them a good citizen virtuously</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.959" end="00:40:57.019" style="s2">simultaneously so they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.420" end="00:40:58.729" style="s2">creating an incentive for women to start</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.019" end="00:41:00.229" style="s2">to notice that new race to the top</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.729" end="00:41:04.189" style="s2">scenario you could have a recursion</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.229" end="00:41:06.799" style="s2">there this is obviously a total tangent</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.189" end="00:41:09.400" style="s2">from the question you asked me but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.799" end="00:41:09.400" style="s2">an interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:17.509" style="s2">okay actually I did actually yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:22.220" style="s2">curious if this is what you were getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.509" end="00:41:23.990" style="s2">at on the Weinstein podcast you mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.220" end="00:41:28.670" style="s2">when I avoided his questions about sex</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.990" end="00:41:31.099" style="s2">selection yes no I just didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.670" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">talk about that topic there because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.099" end="00:41:35.089" style="s2">a big ass very varied audience and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:36.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t think the answers were within the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.089" end="00:41:42.470" style="s2">zone of proximal development of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.710" end="00:41:46.130" style="s2">audience as its as a side question this</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.470" end="00:41:51.470" style="s2">is a central and also thorny issue for</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.130" end="00:41:53.690" style="s2">sure um I just want to let people know</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.470" end="00:41:55.490" style="s2">that if your question was like really</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.690" end="00:41:57.410" style="s2">early on I am having a tough time</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.490" end="00:41:59.539" style="s2">scrolling up so if you want to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.410" end="00:42:02.630" style="s2">question again or is more relevant now</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.539" end="00:42:05.930" style="s2">please do so and I do appreciate all the</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">lot of bed and we&#39;ve had some</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.849" end="00:42:18.009" style="s2">discussions on so left to hear what your</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:31.069" style="s2">so we&#39;ll kind of use the frame of using</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.450" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">a very deep underlying thing to address</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.670" end="00:43:53.290" style="s2">important to understand that power</p>

<p begin="00:44:06.940" end="00:44:12.859" style="s2">he he might be richer than three million</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.589" end="00:44:14.780" style="s2">average guys together and if he has</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.859" end="00:44:17.329" style="s2">access to nukes he might be more</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.780" end="00:44:19.490" style="s2">powerful than 3 billion average guys</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.329" end="00:44:21.309" style="s2">together it&#39;s like what the fuck that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.490" end="00:44:25.220" style="s2">so many orders of magnitude of asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.309" end="00:44:29.059" style="s2">so our you know technology and capital</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.220" end="00:44:32.390" style="s2">have created thousands millions billions</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.059" end="00:44:34.579" style="s2">of times a cemetry in power and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.390" end="00:44:36.140" style="s2">not an evolutionary thing which means it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.579" end="00:44:38.180" style="s2">it actually broke evolution in the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.140" end="00:44:39.799" style="s2">that we think of it evolution depends</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.180" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">upon cemetery&#39;s of power I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.799" end="00:44:43.150" style="s2">into vexed I&#39;ve talked about that other</p>

<p begin="00:44:45.380" end="00:44:49.619" style="s2">but when you have a power-law</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.069" end="00:44:52.410" style="s2">distribution like this of say wealth</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.619" end="00:44:54.150" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s like only a few people</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.410" end="00:44:56.729" style="s2">in groups that have a trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.150" end="00:44:58.170" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a slightly larger group</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.729" end="00:45:01.289" style="s2">that have a hundred billion but still</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.170" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">very very small and then you realize</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.289" end="00:45:05.309" style="s2">that there&#39;s a tiny number of people</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.119" end="00:45:08.069" style="s2">that have more ability to influence the</p>

<p begin="00:45:08.069" end="00:45:17.219" style="s2">combined and the same is true with</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.400" end="00:45:19.109" style="s2">access to military power so then you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.219" end="00:45:21.869" style="s2">what does it take to get to the top of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.109" end="00:45:23.670" style="s2">power-law distribution of power or what</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.869" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">what does it take behaviorally and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.670" end="00:45:28.349" style="s2">what does it take psychologically to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:34.440" style="s2">just to create the disposition for those</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.349" end="00:45:37.589" style="s2">behaviors and to be successful at it if</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.440" end="00:45:39.690" style="s2">I have a bunch of money I don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.589" end="00:45:42.839" style="s2">very hard for me to know why someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.690" end="00:45:44.190" style="s2">claims to like me right or why do they</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.839" end="00:45:45.450" style="s2">want to be my friend or why they want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.190" end="00:45:46.559" style="s2">be in a relationship especially if</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.450" end="00:45:48.450" style="s2">people know that I have a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.559" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard for me to have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.450" end="00:45:52.469" style="s2">trust an authentic relationship this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:55.880" style="s2">a psychological harm almost every</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.469" end="00:45:58.799" style="s2">wealthy person I know has in common</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.880" end="00:46:02.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of reasons why it really</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.799" end="00:46:04.680" style="s2">sucks to have more power it also means</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.369" end="00:46:06.690" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna be forced to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.680" end="00:46:08.130" style="s2">some of these rivalries things where</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.690" end="00:46:09.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like doesn&#39;t matter democrat or</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.130" end="00:46:12.569" style="s2">republican all the presidents of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.900" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">u.s. in recent history have used the US</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.569" end="00:46:17.729" style="s2">military to kill civilians that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.839" end="00:46:20.369" style="s2">fucking deal most people on here would</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.729" end="00:46:24.949" style="s2">not want to authorize a drone strike</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.369" end="00:46:27.089" style="s2">that was going to kill civilians so</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.949" end="00:46:29.279" style="s2">engaging in the game of power becomes</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.089" end="00:46:36.779" style="s2">obligate if you get near the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.279" end="00:46:41.779" style="s2">power stack so typically cluster b-type</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.779" end="00:46:45.479" style="s2">disorders that are both oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.779" end="00:46:47.430" style="s2">wanting power and that are less</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.479" end="00:46:48.930" style="s2">restrained in their use of it will do</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.430" end="00:46:52.410" style="s2">better at getting it and groups that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.930" end="00:46:54.900" style="s2">either are more considerate of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.410" end="00:46:56.519" style="s2">and don&#39;t want to externalize and cause</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.900" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">harm are gonna get less power which</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.519" end="00:46:58.650" style="s2">means less influence over the system as</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:00.930" style="s2">a whole which</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.650" end="00:47:04.470" style="s2">the whole system will have this gradient</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.930" end="00:47:06.540" style="s2">towards sociopathy now this all of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.470" end="00:47:08.430" style="s2">conversations around theodicy and the</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.350" end="00:47:21.990" style="s2">up because yes about the Amazon okay if</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.920" end="00:47:26.370" style="s2">you start to understand why the Amazon</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.800" end="00:49:51.930" style="s2">protection of the Amazon right now the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.349" end="00:49:54.750" style="s2">government has to still okay certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.930" end="00:49:57.420" style="s2">things but the government is also a non</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.750" end="00:49:59.490" style="s2">agent run by people and so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.420" end="00:50:02.210" style="s2">particular person that got to be the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.490" end="00:50:04.680" style="s2">head of the Interior or the president</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.210" end="00:50:06.690" style="s2">isn&#39;t gonna be in that position for all</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.680" end="00:50:08.310" style="s2">that long but he&#39;s gonna keep being a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.690" end="00:50:11.670" style="s2">person in having a family and having a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.310" end="00:50:13.319" style="s2">legacy for a long time so if he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.670" end="00:50:15.150" style="s2">do the thing that protects the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.319" end="00:50:16.290" style="s2">four years later when he&#39;s out someone</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.150" end="00:50:18.420" style="s2">else will fuck the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.290" end="00:50:20.940" style="s2">so it seems inexorable but if he goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.420" end="00:50:22.890" style="s2">ahead and lets it happen he gets a bank</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.940" end="00:50:24.930" style="s2">account in Switzerland or let Kim Stein</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.890" end="00:50:26.819" style="s2">filled up with a bunch of money for him</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.930" end="00:50:28.440" style="s2">and his family so you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.819" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a confluence of perverse</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.440" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">incentive and asymmetry between the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">upside and downside kind of everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">the psychologies that are in play in</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.140" end="00:50:44.310" style="s2">making those decisions are not the ones</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:45.990" style="s2">that they express to be right in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.310" end="00:50:47.730" style="s2">news everyone&#39;s expressing certain</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.990" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">considerations because those are not the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.730" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">actual ones at play and but now what</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:59.089" style="s2">types of tools do they use to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:51:01.800" style="s2">effective well you have financial</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.089" end="00:51:03.660" style="s2">institutions that have trillions of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.800" end="00:51:04.770" style="s2">dollars or at least tens or hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.660" end="00:51:07.079" style="s2">billions of dollars in assets under</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.770" end="00:51:09.150" style="s2">management that can financially</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.079" end="00:51:10.890" style="s2">manipulate a sovereign government by</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.150" end="00:51:12.500" style="s2">being able to pay off enough of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.890" end="00:51:15.230" style="s2">corrupt politicians being able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.500" end="00:51:19.490" style="s2">incentivize the government as a whole to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.230" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">basically co-opt its sovereign law</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.490" end="00:51:24.610" style="s2">Greenpeace doesn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:26.200" style="s2">like the nonprofit&#39;s that are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.610" end="00:51:27.370" style="s2">protect the Amazon for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.200" end="00:51:29.140" style="s2">they aren&#39;t even trying to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.370" end="00:51:32.230" style="s2">Amazon the young activists in them are</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.140" end="00:51:34.360" style="s2">but the top of the NGOs the NGOs end up</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.230" end="00:51:37.240" style="s2">getting a lot of power some of the NGOs</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.360" end="00:51:38.620" style="s2">and this is actually an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.240" end="00:51:42.030" style="s2">to understand that I learned very much</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.620" end="00:51:46.680" style="s2">the hard way coming up in this space is</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.030" end="00:51:49.270" style="s2">if there&#39;s a problem and you incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.680" end="00:51:50.860" style="s2">what you make a company or an</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.270" end="00:51:52.720" style="s2">organization or a non-profit or a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.860" end="00:51:54.250" style="s2">government agency to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.720" end="00:51:55.630" style="s2">and now the there are people who have</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.250" end="00:51:57.220" style="s2">salaries forever and they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.630" end="00:51:59.740" style="s2">salaries before and they have access to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.220" end="00:52:00.970" style="s2">power and prestige if you really solve</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.740" end="00:52:02.170" style="s2">that problem that whole thing would go</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.970" end="00:52:03.460" style="s2">out of business and all those people to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.170" end="00:52:05.320" style="s2">lose all that stuff that was beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.460" end="00:52:07.600" style="s2">to them so they have an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.320" end="00:52:09.400" style="s2">incentive to maintain the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.600" end="00:52:11.110" style="s2">maintain the legitimacy of them as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.400" end="00:52:13.000" style="s2">response to managing it so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.110" end="00:52:14.470" style="s2">incentives skewed towards managing</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.000" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">problems forever rather than really</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.470" end="00:52:18.910" style="s2">solving or obsoleting them so you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:20.590" style="s2">to really pay attention to the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.910" end="00:52:24.070" style="s2">architectures underneath all of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.590" end="00:52:25.900" style="s2">things usually I can look at someone has</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.070" end="00:52:27.430" style="s2">a plan for how to fix the Amazon or the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.900" end="00:52:30.130" style="s2">grid or nuclear disarmament I just have</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.430" end="00:52:31.660" style="s2">to look at the incentive landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.130" end="00:52:33.340" style="s2">the institutions and people that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.660" end="00:52:39.940" style="s2">involved and will usually have a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.340" end="00:52:44.350" style="s2">quick sense of where it fails so as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.940" end="00:52:46.360" style="s2">transition from game a to game B where</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.350" end="00:52:50.560" style="s2">we are in the presence of ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.360" end="00:52:52.090" style="s2">rivalry that is both empowered with very</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.560" end="00:52:55.500" style="s2">high level national and private</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.090" end="00:52:57.790" style="s2">intelligence and the top level financial</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.500" end="00:53:02.200" style="s2">capabilities and private militias and</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.790" end="00:53:05.110" style="s2">all that shit we don&#39;t get to gain B if</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.200" end="00:53:06.430" style="s2">we lose comprehensively in the game</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.110" end="00:53:09.250" style="s2">anything right now so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.430" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">question we&#39;ve asked before of if the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.250" end="00:53:15.580" style="s2">peaceful cultures always get killed by</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:16.750" style="s2">the warring cultures and if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.580" end="00:53:18.220" style="s2">get killed at the warring cultures</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.750" end="00:53:19.720" style="s2">because they get better at war which</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.220" end="00:53:22.600" style="s2">makes them no longer peaceful cultures</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.720" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">that&#39;s another way to describe Moloc how</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.600" end="00:53:26.740" style="s2">do you have peaceful cultures that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:29.860" style="s2">get killed by the warring cultures or</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.740" end="00:53:33.780" style="s2">get converted into them is another key</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.860" end="00:53:36.220" style="s2">way to kind of think about this and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.780" end="00:53:39.099" style="s2">another way to think about it is what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.220" end="00:53:44.920" style="s2">legitimate power versus illegitimate</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.099" end="00:53:48.130" style="s2">power and one way of defining that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.920" end="00:53:51.099" style="s2">way I define it is so let&#39;s say we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.130" end="00:53:53.950" style="s2">a power law distribution of power if I</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.099" end="00:53:57.310" style="s2">start to gain more power in that so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.950" end="00:53:59.560" style="s2">have 10x the money of average people or</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.310" end="00:54:05.020" style="s2">100x or whatever it is or visibility or</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.560" end="00:54:08.530" style="s2">something I&#39;m benefiting from that I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.020" end="00:54:10.359" style="s2">pay gardeners and maids and people to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.530" end="00:54:10.930" style="s2">come do shit for me at less than I make</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.359" end="00:54:12.730" style="s2">per hour</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.930" end="00:54:15.160" style="s2">like I&#39;m really benefiting from that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.730" end="00:54:16.930" style="s2">power asymmetry and if those people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.160" end="00:54:19.270" style="s2">charge that rate charge the same thing I</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.930" end="00:54:21.609" style="s2">charge I wouldn&#39;t be able to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.270" end="00:54:23.260" style="s2">I&#39;m maximally incentive to maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.609" end="00:54:24.730" style="s2">power asymmetry and grow it so it goes</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.260" end="00:54:27.670" style="s2">from maids and gardeners to yacht</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.730" end="00:54:31.630" style="s2">repairers and whatever else right and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.670" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">typically if anyone has an asymmetry of</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.630" end="00:54:36.280" style="s2">power they have both an incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:37.420" style="s2">the capability to grow they&#39;re a cemetry</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.280" end="00:54:39.099" style="s2">of power they have the capability</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.420" end="00:54:41.560" style="s2">because they have more power right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.099" end="00:54:45.160" style="s2">they have the incentive so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.560" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">illage illegitimate power is doing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.160" end="00:54:50.460" style="s2">is utilizing asymmetric power to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">maintain and grow the asymmetry of power</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.460" end="00:54:54.940" style="s2">which then has other groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:56.200" style="s2">most everyone else isn&#39;t capable so you</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.940" end="00:54:57.790" style="s2">have the separation of the haves and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.200" end="00:54:59.260" style="s2">have-nots and the haves or the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.790" end="00:55:02.320" style="s2">ones who have power written the arms</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.260" end="00:55:03.790" style="s2">races with each other and competitions</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.320" end="00:55:05.470" style="s2">for controlling the minds of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.790" end="00:55:09.670" style="s2">else so they vote in purchase in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.470" end="00:55:12.070" style="s2">right direction what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.670" end="00:55:15.550" style="s2">legitimate power or power in a game B</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.070" end="00:55:17.619" style="s2">direction is if I have an asymmetry of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.550" end="00:55:20.140" style="s2">power I want to use it to uplift</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.619" end="00:55:22.060" style="s2">everyone else to have more power and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.140" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">utilize it better to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.060" end="00:55:28.420" style="s2">legitimate power access of everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:31.210" style="s2">and which is basically what teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.420" end="00:55:32.560" style="s2">Authority is right teacher is saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.210" end="00:55:34.330" style="s2">okay I have knowledge that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.560" end="00:55:35.770" style="s2">have but I&#39;m not trying to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.330" end="00:55:37.330" style="s2">knowledge over my student forever I</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.770" end="00:55:39.460" style="s2">actually want my student to surpass me</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.330" end="00:55:41.099" style="s2">so how do I use this increased capacity</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.460" end="00:55:45.000" style="s2">in a div that intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.099" end="00:55:47.940" style="s2">developmental way now what I want is</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.000" end="00:55:50.119" style="s2">people who have that orientation</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.940" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">actually get good at power</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.119" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">actually develop asymmetric power so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:59.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that the CIA and the CCP</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:01.730" style="s2">and the Kremlin and dark pool</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.890" end="00:56:03.619" style="s2">organizations that have it in black</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.730" end="00:56:05.660" style="s2">water but it&#39;s groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.619" end="00:56:07.549" style="s2">authentically oriented in the legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.660" end="00:56:09.559" style="s2">use of power who are developing it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.549" end="00:56:11.140" style="s2">then utilizing it for those purposes and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.559" end="00:56:13.789" style="s2">that power both means that they can</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.140" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">adequately defend themselves against the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.789" end="00:56:19.220" style="s2">attacks while helping to move things in</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:21.499" style="s2">a different direction so if I look at</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.220" end="00:56:24.259" style="s2">what are the capacities and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.499" end="00:56:27.740" style="s2">tools that say multinationals will use</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.259" end="00:56:29.059" style="s2">to influence sovereign governments to</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.740" end="00:56:31.210" style="s2">take their mineral rights and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.059" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">they&#39;ll come give them a big ass loan</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.210" end="00:56:37.400" style="s2">that they know they can never pay back</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:38.660" style="s2">that&#39;s collateralized with the asset</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.400" end="00:56:40.339" style="s2">rights of the infrastructure of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.660" end="00:56:41.539" style="s2">country right the World Bank has done</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.339" end="00:56:43.009" style="s2">that forever trying to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.539" end="00:56:44.210" style="s2">watching the World Bank they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.009" end="00:56:49.430" style="s2">better than we are but it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.210" end="00:56:50.900" style="s2">shit so and they another example of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.430" end="00:56:53.450" style="s2">tool they&#39;ll use so that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.900" end="00:56:55.730" style="s2">predatory lending another example will</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.450" end="00:56:58.519" style="s2">be bundling and we see our politicians</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.730" end="00:57:01.220" style="s2">do this all the time here&#39;s proposition</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.519" end="00:57:03.170" style="s2">a makes clean water for everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.220" end="00:57:04.489" style="s2">without it we&#39;re Flint Michigan and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.170" end="00:57:05.930" style="s2">whatever and everybody&#39;s gonna fuckin</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.489" end="00:57:07.430" style="s2">die from hexa chromate okay everybody</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.930" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">wants proposition a but in the fine</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.430" end="00:57:13.549" style="s2">print it also includes taking away some</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:14.749" style="s2">civil liberty that has nothing fucking</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.549" end="00:57:16.069" style="s2">to do with clean water like what the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.749" end="00:57:17.839" style="s2">fuck we do surveillance Tech is</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.069" end="00:57:19.009" style="s2">implanted everywhere how does that have</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.839" end="00:57:21.410" style="s2">anything to do with it well because the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.009" end="00:57:22.759" style="s2">the person who wanted that figured out</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.410" end="00:57:24.920" style="s2">how to bundle it where you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.759" end="00:57:28.819" style="s2">for it so bundling is a game a tool that</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.920" end="00:57:32.359" style="s2">is mostly used for evil but it could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.819" end="00:57:34.190" style="s2">used for good right just like the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.359" end="00:57:39.140" style="s2">types of lending and indebted MIT could</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.190" end="00:57:40.579" style="s2">be so let&#39;s say let me give the example</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.140" end="00:57:43.730" style="s2">of Ecuador in the Amazon now I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.579" end="00:57:45.079" style="s2">building rectangles yes great I was just</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.730" end="00:57:47.089" style="s2">gonna jump in and ask you how you</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.079" end="00:57:50.450" style="s2">connect it back and specifically what I</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.089" end="00:57:51.829" style="s2">could our example so the since I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.450" end="00:57:53.869" style="s2">nine different countries I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.829" end="00:57:56.569" style="s2">deal with and the Amazon as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.869" end="00:57:58.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have sovereign law there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.569" end="00:58:00.279" style="s2">an IG oh that has any meaningful power</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.519" end="00:58:02.329" style="s2">to be able to bind predatory capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.279" end="00:58:04.010" style="s2">so I have to work at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.329" end="00:58:06.410" style="s2">individual countries but we already said</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.010" end="00:58:07.970" style="s2">that if a particular country says we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.410" end="00:58:10.010" style="s2">not gonna let rainforest extraction</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.970" end="00:58:11.330" style="s2">happen they do so much economically less</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.010" end="00:58:14.810" style="s2">well than the other countries that they</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.330" end="00:58:16.910" style="s2">get so much pushback so how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.810" end="00:58:18.860" style="s2">a situation where a single country can</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.910" end="00:58:20.990" style="s2">actually do economically better and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.860" end="00:58:23.030" style="s2">better in terms of their economics their</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.990" end="00:58:23.810" style="s2">publicity their national security by</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.030" end="00:58:25.610" style="s2">doing something that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.810" end="00:58:27.020" style="s2">environmentally more friendly so we</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.610" end="00:58:28.610" style="s2">create a race to the top rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.020" end="00:58:30.590" style="s2">race to the bottom can we engineer such</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.610" end="00:58:32.270" style="s2">a scenario the answer ends up being yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.590" end="00:58:36.170" style="s2">and this is one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.270" end="00:58:38.120" style="s2">particularly interested in right now so</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.170" end="00:58:40.160" style="s2">let&#39;s say we take Ecuador as an example</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.120" end="00:58:42.620" style="s2">because it&#39;s the headwater of the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.160" end="00:58:45.080" style="s2">right Brazil is the largest total body</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.620" end="00:58:47.570" style="s2">of Amazon Peru has some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.080" end="00:58:49.130" style="s2">biodiversity but the headwater of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.570" end="00:58:54.100" style="s2">Amazon is the most sensitive area and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.130" end="00:58:59.540" style="s2">happens to be highly at risk right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.100" end="00:59:01.340" style="s2">so Ecuador owes 14 billion dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.540" end="00:59:02.900" style="s2">the World Bank and 20 billion dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.340" end="00:59:05.300" style="s2">China that it doesn&#39;t have any economic</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.900" end="00:59:06.820" style="s2">capability to be able to pay off so</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.300" end="00:59:09.650" style="s2">those are loans that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.820" end="00:59:11.840" style="s2">default at some point they are</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.650" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2">collateralized with the asset rights at</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.840" end="00:59:17.030" style="s2">the headwaters of the Amazon what do we</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.440" end="00:59:23.030" style="s2">do with that headwaters the Amazon goes</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.030" end="00:59:28.070" style="s2">the entire Amazon goes well what most</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.030" end="00:59:30.230" style="s2">NGOs do is they just put picket signs by</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.070" end="00:59:31.910" style="s2">the bulldozers and tried to like hold</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.230" end="00:59:34.580" style="s2">the frontline and maybe empower the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.910" end="00:59:36.140" style="s2">indigenous people with some resistance</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.580" end="00:59:37.940" style="s2">of the frontline which doesn&#39;t fucking</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.140" end="00:59:39.890" style="s2">work at all right because this way you</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.940" end="00:59:41.540" style="s2">have an indigenous person an indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.890" end="00:59:45.410" style="s2">leader getting killed pretty much every</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.540" end="00:59:48.230" style="s2">day in the Amazon and they don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.410" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">hiring private militias behind plausible</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.230" end="00:59:53.470" style="s2">deniability that they didn&#39;t do it like</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:53.470" style="s2">that is par for the course all the time</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.970" end="01:00:02.810" style="s2">now slightly craftier activists will say</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.450" end="01:00:04.820" style="s2">okay what we&#39;re gonna do is rile the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.810" end="01:00:06.440" style="s2">people up to really care well the people</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.820" end="01:00:08.750" style="s2">are poor they want economic</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.440" end="01:00:10.400" style="s2">opportunities it seems like there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.750" end="01:00:12.050" style="s2">endless amount of Amazon and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.400" end="01:00:15.110" style="s2">benefiting a few indigenous people and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.050" end="01:00:17.630" style="s2">not them and and they the nonprofit&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.110" end="01:00:19.670" style="s2">don&#39;t control the media as effectively</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.630" end="01:00:21.619" style="s2">as the for-profits do which is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.670" end="01:00:23.480" style="s2">telling everyone else hey they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.619" end="01:00:26.539" style="s2">to keep us from our own national assets</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.480" end="01:00:28.309" style="s2">and keep you poor okay so how do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.539" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">actually win at the narrative game and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.309" end="01:00:34.250" style="s2">then maybe even craftier ones will say</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:35.720" style="s2">okay really we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.250" end="01:00:37.910" style="s2">economic so we&#39;re gonna bring in</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.720" end="01:00:39.319" style="s2">economics alternative to extractive</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.910" end="01:00:41.450" style="s2">rainforests stuff we&#39;re gonna say hey</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.319" end="01:00:45.049" style="s2">look we&#39;re gonna bring a Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.450" end="01:00:47.000" style="s2">tech sector to Quito so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.049" end="01:00:48.230" style="s2">start making a lot of money with tech so</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.000" end="01:00:51.049" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to do the rainforest</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.230" end="01:00:52.430" style="s2">stuff and they say awesome do that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.049" end="01:00:54.500" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work if it does work</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.430" end="01:00:56.059" style="s2">awesome and we&#39;re still doing the Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.500" end="01:00:58.009" style="s2">sales because that&#39;s money today and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.059" end="01:00:59.900" style="s2">know how to do that so you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.009" end="01:01:02.240" style="s2">have to bring an alternative you have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.900" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">bind the predatory capitalism not just</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:05.269" style="s2">bring an alternative better capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:06.470" style="s2">you have to bind the other one because</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.269" end="01:01:08.089" style="s2">if you don&#39;t bind the other one both</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.470" end="01:01:10.549" style="s2">running side by side the other one still</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.089" end="01:01:14.599" style="s2">kills everything all right well how do</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.549" end="01:01:16.279" style="s2">you do that so an example in Ecuador</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.599" end="01:01:18.230" style="s2">could look like this and I&#39;m giving it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.279" end="01:01:21.849" style="s2">at a very high topological level but you</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.230" end="01:01:21.849" style="s2">can just see the types of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.940" end="01:01:27.470" style="s2">they&#39;re just like climate change has a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.950" end="01:01:29.509" style="s2">runaway positive feedback loop where at</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.470" end="01:01:32.980" style="s2">a certain point and climate change the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.509" end="01:01:34.789" style="s2">heating makes it easier to heat faster</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.980" end="01:01:36.349" style="s2">rainforest destruction has a runaway</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.789" end="01:01:37.880" style="s2">feedback loop because you have this</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.349" end="01:01:39.259" style="s2">thing called the hydrological pump or</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.880" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">waters evaporating through the trees</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.259" end="01:01:45.049" style="s2">which makes moisture which creates it</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:47.269" style="s2">being a rainforest which keeps pumping</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.049" end="01:01:48.980" style="s2">water because you have a lot of rain now</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.269" end="01:01:50.660" style="s2">what happens with that hydrological pump</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.980" end="01:01:52.009" style="s2">is some of the water falls back over the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.660" end="01:01:53.690" style="s2">Amazon and some of it goes into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.009" end="01:01:55.190" style="s2">atmosphere and goes to some convection</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.690" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">current and that&#39;s actually where 30 to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.190" end="01:01:59.000" style="s2">50 percent yearly if North America&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.890" style="s2">rainfall comes from its transpiration</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.000" end="01:02:03.079" style="s2">from the Amazon now you start to lose</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.890" end="01:02:05.690" style="s2">enough forest cover where you get less</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.079" end="01:02:07.400" style="s2">rain and then you get less transpiration</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.690" end="01:02:09.259" style="s2">which gets drier which makes it easier</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.400" end="01:02:10.910" style="s2">for the to lose more forest cover and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.259" end="01:02:12.829" style="s2">fires and like that and you get a kind</p>

<p begin="01:02:34.800" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">if you break the hydrological pump and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.780" end="01:02:42.340" style="s2">North America loses 30 to 50 percent of</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:08.050" style="s2">national security threat to the US yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.980" end="01:03:09.700" style="s2">they should do they currently no</p>

<p begin="01:03:09.700" end="01:03:14.619" style="s2">putting those together does the State</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.440" end="01:03:16.600" style="s2">Department have big-boy capabilities to</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.619" end="01:03:18.369" style="s2">intervene just like the multinationals</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.600" end="01:03:23.260" style="s2">do with a different set of incentives</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.369" end="01:03:25.390" style="s2">where you&#39;re actually helping where</p>

<p begin="01:03:32.200" end="01:03:37.840" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a possible strategy so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.500" end="01:03:39.130" style="s2">talked to some people about that State</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.840" end="01:03:40.540" style="s2">Department they&#39;re like yes if we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.130" end="01:03:42.550" style="s2">see that that&#39;s a real thing then we</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.540" end="01:03:44.350" style="s2">would ensure that didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.550" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">well that by sometime it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.350" end="01:03:50.260" style="s2">long-term solution because you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:52.150" style="s2">keeping economic development from</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.260" end="01:03:53.830" style="s2">happening for a long time so you also</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.150" end="01:03:54.970" style="s2">then have to propose better economic</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.830" end="01:03:57.910" style="s2">development opportunities for those</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.970" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">countries but that also bind the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.910" end="01:04:02.800" style="s2">predatory capitalism parts so rather</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:04.420" style="s2">than say we&#39;re gonna help you ecuador</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.800" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">build your own mining company rather</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.420" end="01:04:07.869" style="s2">than the chinese multinational come in</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:09.250" style="s2">and do the mining for you where they</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.869" end="01:04:10.630" style="s2">have no incentive to do environmental</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.250" end="01:04:11.950" style="s2">protection because they&#39;re gonna leave</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.630" end="01:04:13.630" style="s2">and don&#39;t give a shit about the toxic</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.950" end="01:04:16.180" style="s2">tailings left and they don&#39;t even employ</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.630" end="01:04:17.740" style="s2">local people they bring their own people</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.180" end="01:04:19.570" style="s2">over and you make a penny on the dollar</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.740" end="01:04:21.280" style="s2">because you&#39;re just basically selling</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.570" end="01:04:25.420" style="s2">the asset rights we&#39;re gonna help you</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.280" end="01:04:28.540" style="s2">create your own national mind where you</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.420" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">employ people at a fair wage living</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.540" end="01:04:31.960" style="s2">there and it&#39;s environmentally safe and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">you have the right incentive to do it</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.960" end="01:04:34.720" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to do anywhere near</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:36.190" style="s2">as much of it to make even more money</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:37.300" style="s2">because you have higher margins and can</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.190" end="01:04:38.590" style="s2">sell the things on the open market</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.300" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">you just don&#39;t have the capability do</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.590" end="01:04:41.770" style="s2">that upfront so we&#39;re gonna bring the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:43.080" style="s2">capital and the and the contracting</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.770" end="01:04:44.400" style="s2">capabilities to help you do that</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.080" end="01:04:45.840" style="s2">we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.400" end="01:04:50.910" style="s2">do that because I still doesn&#39;t bind the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.840" end="01:04:52.260" style="s2">other thing what we say is can we get</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.910" end="01:04:56.430" style="s2">this if the State Department got</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.260" end="01:04:58.350" style="s2">involved and said fuck we actually have</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.430" end="01:05:00.090" style="s2">to do this ongoingly and we can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.350" end="01:05:02.340" style="s2">militaristically we need to get the debt</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.090" end="01:05:04.110" style="s2">forgiven can the State Department put</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.340" end="01:05:05.250" style="s2">pressure on the world bank to forgive</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.110" end="01:05:07.290" style="s2">the debt based on their relationship</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.250" end="01:05:09.150" style="s2">sure it could could the World Bank put</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.290" end="01:05:10.980" style="s2">pressure on the Chinese government to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.150" end="01:05:12.510" style="s2">the same thing and not down grade the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.980" end="01:05:13.740" style="s2">quality of their debt yeah they could</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.510" end="01:05:15.840" style="s2">there&#39;s an arrangement you could make</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.740" end="01:05:19.710" style="s2">there so now let&#39;s say we create an</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.840" end="01:05:21.180" style="s2">organization we start to talk to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.710" end="01:05:22.350" style="s2">State Department about that deal start</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.180" end="01:05:23.700" style="s2">to talk to the world bank about that</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.350" end="01:05:26.850" style="s2">they&#39;ll see how to kind of set that</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.700" end="01:05:28.890" style="s2">thing up and then we also look at how to</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.850" end="01:05:32.070" style="s2">do them mining properly that creates</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.890" end="01:05:34.380" style="s2">wealth for the people in the area and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.070" end="01:05:35.400" style="s2">we now we come to the president of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.380" end="01:05:37.500" style="s2">Ecuador and the other people and say</p>

<p begin="01:06:07.050" end="01:06:11.670" style="s2">but the schools and all these other</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:16.130" style="s2">things and this because the mining will</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.670" end="01:06:19.230" style="s2">be very high profit but say schools and</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.130" end="01:06:21.150" style="s2">roads and County clinics need money</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.230" end="01:06:23.690" style="s2">subsidized from somewhere so we bundle</p>

<p begin="01:06:34.890" end="01:06:38.310" style="s2">right now so we can get massive pension</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:39.870" style="s2">funds with trillions of dollars to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.310" end="01:06:41.010" style="s2">able to get a couple percent return and</p>

<p begin="01:06:59.849" end="01:07:03.799" style="s2">than the fucked up when they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.140" end="01:07:06.450" style="s2">and that&#39;s using manipulative tactics</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.799" end="01:07:08.009" style="s2">but that are actually in the service of</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.450" end="01:07:09.749" style="s2">the environment and the people rather</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.009" end="01:07:11.220" style="s2">than fucking the the environment and the</p>

<p begin="01:07:11.220" end="01:07:18.829" style="s2">externalize that would be called using</p>

<p begin="01:07:25.049" end="01:07:31.109" style="s2">and you start to get a race to the top</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.670" end="01:07:33.960" style="s2">between the countries right I learned</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.109" end="01:07:35.489" style="s2">about how to think about those complex</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.960" end="01:07:37.380" style="s2">kind of operating agreements from a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.489" end="01:07:38.789" style="s2">friend named Nelson Del Rio who&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.380" end="01:07:40.890" style="s2">the best thinkers on this topic he</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.789" end="01:07:43.019" style="s2">helped develop the p3 model the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.890" end="01:07:44.880" style="s2">public-private partnership and then saw</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.019" end="01:07:46.470" style="s2">how that got weaponized so he moved on</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.880" end="01:07:48.329" style="s2">to a project called prosperity of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.470" end="01:07:52.049" style="s2">Commons and has has done really</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.329" end="01:07:53.789" style="s2">brilliant work in the space like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.049" end="01:07:55.259" style="s2">a million details of how that actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.789" end="01:07:57.200" style="s2">works and there&#39;s a million yeah but</p>

<p begin="01:08:26.580" end="01:08:31.980" style="s2">will end up going on YouTube so I know</p>

<p begin="01:08:31.980" end="01:08:36.179" style="s2">try and cure many many times but it</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.049" end="01:08:38.580" style="s2">sounds like a more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.179" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">solution it&#39;s needed in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.580" end="01:08:46.080" style="s2">thinking about how we look at the Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:48.179" style="s2">we have about maybe 15 minutes left I do</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.080" end="01:08:50.639" style="s2">want to pivot to a question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.179" end="01:08:54.869" style="s2">probably closer to our hearts and pass</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.639" end="01:08:55.949" style="s2">it to Peter Thank You Phil asked my</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.869" end="01:08:57.179" style="s2">question the moment but I just got a</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.949" end="01:08:59.369" style="s2">text I won&#39;t say who it&#39;s from but</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.179" end="01:09:01.139" style="s2">during the room oh my god please have</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.369" end="01:09:03.600" style="s2">Daniels Moktar Berger come back on that</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.139" end="01:09:05.909" style="s2">on the sex thing he evaded with</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.600" end="01:09:07.409" style="s2">Weinstein so maybe we&#39;ll have time to</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.909" end="01:09:10.170" style="s2">squeeze that in after my question but</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.409" end="01:09:13.810" style="s2">just wanted for that there</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.170" end="01:09:17.260" style="s2">so yeah my question was about power</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.810" end="01:09:19.150" style="s2">literacy and legitimate power so at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.260" end="01:09:20.710" style="s2">store we have we&#39;re experimenting with a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.150" end="01:09:23.260" style="s2">lot of different psycho texts we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.710" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">wisdom gym that&#39;s forming I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.260" end="01:09:27.580" style="s2">different like techniques and modalities</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:29.740" style="s2">like version mapping and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.580" end="01:09:31.180" style="s2">based off same old verges technique in</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.740" end="01:09:33.850" style="s2">order to kind of get power awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.180" end="01:09:36.850" style="s2">whatnot do you have any recommendations</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.850" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">what we can do in this sort of body</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.850" end="01:09:40.210" style="s2">tribe that&#39;s forming at the stoy we feel</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.040" end="01:09:42.819" style="s2">kind of there&#39;s like a family there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.210" end="01:09:44.260" style="s2">like a loving tribe for me here and is</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.819" end="01:09:47.109" style="s2">there any recommendations that you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.260" end="01:09:55.600" style="s2">give us to get legitimate power and gain</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.109" end="01:09:59.860" style="s2">power literacy I remember when I first</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.600" end="01:10:03.430" style="s2">read the 48 laws of power and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.860" end="01:10:05.230" style="s2">I read that and I hate I had read Sun</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.430" end="01:10:06.880" style="s2">Tzu but I hadn&#39;t read Machiavelli and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.230" end="01:10:08.110" style="s2">hadn&#39;t read Lacan and Strauss and a</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.880" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">number of the other like source</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.110" end="01:10:19.180" style="s2">materials yet and it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:20.890" style="s2">interesting I was very impressed with</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.180" end="01:10:26.440" style="s2">what he did I thought it was the worst</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.890" end="01:10:30.130" style="s2">book ever written and that obviously</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.440" end="01:10:33.730" style="s2">also means a valuable thing because he</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.130" end="01:10:35.530" style="s2">took so much of military theory and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.730" end="01:10:38.170" style="s2">courtier and political and like all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.530" end="01:10:40.930" style="s2">the evil stuff of game a and he both</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.170" end="01:10:47.650" style="s2">said one it&#39;s an excerpt and two its</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.930" end="01:10:52.260" style="s2">virtue that&#39;s always the path to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.650" end="01:10:55.540" style="s2">dark side actually pretty much always is</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.260" end="01:10:57.550" style="s2">power use of this kind is inexorable so</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.540" end="01:10:59.080" style="s2">arm on talking to Gandalf saying Sauron</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.550" end="01:11:00.730" style="s2">is gonna win there&#39;s no choice might as</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.080" end="01:11:04.870" style="s2">well beat us right might as well join us</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.730" end="01:11:10.780" style="s2">rather than lose write it like that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.870" end="01:11:12.130" style="s2">story is always the case so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.780" end="01:11:17.980" style="s2">share this because it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.130" end="01:11:21.730" style="s2">interesting I had a conversation several</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.980" end="01:11:26.100" style="s2">years ago with one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.730" end="01:11:28.239" style="s2">powerful evil power brokers in the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.100" end="01:11:30.190" style="s2">long one-on-one where I was actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.239" end="01:11:31.989" style="s2">surprised at how much he kind of both</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.190" end="01:11:38.410" style="s2">was inviting me into his world and</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.989" end="01:11:40.450" style="s2">opening up about it and the way he</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.410" end="01:11:42.180" style="s2">framed it goes like this I&#39;ll just do it</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.450" end="01:11:45.400" style="s2">briefly cuz it&#39;s important it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.180" end="01:11:48.970" style="s2">look humans are animals animals are</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.400" end="01:11:51.640" style="s2">either predators or prey predators don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.970" end="01:11:53.980" style="s2">feel bad when they kill prey if you feel</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.640" end="01:11:55.239" style="s2">bad when the prey humans die it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.980" end="01:11:56.980" style="s2">because you&#39;re a prey human and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.239" end="01:11:58.239" style="s2">won&#39;t run the world the apex predator</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.980" end="01:12:01.060" style="s2">will run the world they will be the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.239" end="01:12:04.000" style="s2">thing that determines the shape of an</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.060" end="01:12:05.980" style="s2">overall ecosystem and whether you like</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.000" end="01:12:07.450" style="s2">what apex predators do or not doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.980" end="01:12:08.950" style="s2">deter doesn&#39;t matter at all to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.450" end="01:12:10.300" style="s2">that apex predators will be the ones who</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.950" end="01:12:11.560" style="s2">run the world so the only question is</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.300" end="01:12:14.620" style="s2">whether you have what it takes to make</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.560" end="01:12:17.890" style="s2">it into that group or not and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.620" end="01:12:20.860" style="s2">the inexorable argument right power in</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.890" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">the form of predatory power is</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.860" end="01:12:24.550" style="s2">inexorable can&#39;t do anything about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:27.730" style="s2">it&#39;s always gonna win well if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.550" end="01:12:29.830" style="s2">case and I can&#39;t effectively fight</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.730" end="01:12:31.900" style="s2">against it that just binds all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.830" end="01:12:35.680" style="s2">moral possibilities as just stupid and</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.900" end="01:12:39.700" style="s2">naive so then the next part was power as</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.680" end="01:12:41.739" style="s2">virtue which he said and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.700" end="01:12:43.150" style="s2">good that though apex predators are the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.739" end="01:12:45.310" style="s2">ones who run the world because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.150" end="01:12:47.020" style="s2">the ones who are steely eyed and real</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.310" end="01:12:49.239" style="s2">and grounded enough to understand how</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.020" end="01:12:51.730" style="s2">shit works and the world is actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.239" end="01:12:53.680" style="s2">kind of brutal and people who just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.730" end="01:12:56.110" style="s2">get how it fucking works can&#39;t guide</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.680" end="01:12:57.910" style="s2">stuff they&#39;ll make it worse sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.110" end="01:12:59.320" style="s2">you got to put a head on a spike in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.910" end="01:13:04.410" style="s2">yard to keep everybody else from being</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.320" end="01:13:10.030" style="s2">assholes and so it goes from power as</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.410" end="01:13:11.590" style="s2">inexorable to power as virtue and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.030" end="01:13:16.120" style="s2">some people stop there and then the last</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.590" end="01:13:18.040" style="s2">step is feeling good about exercising</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.120" end="01:13:19.630" style="s2">your own power over because it says you</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.040" end="01:13:22.720" style="s2">are part of that class which becomes</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.630" end="01:13:25.720" style="s2">power s fetish which is the movement</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.720" end="01:13:28.090" style="s2">from sociopathy to sadism when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.720" end="01:13:30.250" style="s2">actually feta sized fetishize the</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.090" end="01:13:31.660" style="s2">exercising of it now of course</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.250" end="01:13:34.810" style="s2">everything he was saying was utter</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.660" end="01:13:37.210" style="s2">gibberish and it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.810" end="01:13:38.440" style="s2">to know that and I didn&#39;t bring it up</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.210" end="01:13:41.080" style="s2">with him because I knew that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.440" end="01:13:44.950" style="s2">relevant in that moment I was basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.080" end="01:13:46.720" style="s2">getting more information I&#39;m like a blue</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.950" end="01:13:48.460" style="s2">whale is neither predator nor prey in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.720" end="01:13:50.800" style="s2">traditional sense neither is an elephant</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.460" end="01:13:52.480" style="s2">the apex predator is lower on the food</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.800" end="01:13:54.580" style="s2">chain than a virus or a parasite or a</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.480" end="01:13:56.290" style="s2">mosquito in many ways you&#39;re pretending</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.580" end="01:14:01.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s this thing that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.290" end="01:14:04.360" style="s2">really there and you are not</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.960" end="01:14:06.520" style="s2">acknowledging that the arms race that</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.360" end="01:14:09.060" style="s2">has always won self terminates pretty</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.520" end="01:14:11.320" style="s2">soon because when you exponentiate</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.060" end="01:14:13.060" style="s2">externalization and war it actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.320" end="01:14:14.740" style="s2">destroys everything and so basically</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.060" end="01:14:16.240" style="s2">it&#39;s gibberish but it&#39;s compelling</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.740" end="01:14:18.340" style="s2">enough gibberish that if you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.240" end="01:14:20.700" style="s2">want to do it anyways it&#39;s plausible</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.340" end="01:14:24.760" style="s2">deniability</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.700" end="01:14:26.740" style="s2">so what Robert Greene did and the 48</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.760" end="01:14:30.670" style="s2">laws of power was did the same move</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.740" end="01:14:32.710" style="s2">right which is these types of power</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.670" end="01:14:34.180" style="s2">dynamics are inexorable if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.710" end="01:14:38.860" style="s2">know who the sucker in the room is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.180" end="01:14:41.380" style="s2">you if you don&#39;t think these PAP these</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.860" end="01:14:44.170" style="s2">games are at play either you&#39;re stupid</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.380" end="01:14:45.940" style="s2">or you actually do know they&#39;re at play</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.170" end="01:14:49.750" style="s2">and you&#39;re signalling naivete as a power</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.940" end="01:14:51.580" style="s2">trick itself or ignorant signaling or</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.750" end="01:14:55.900" style="s2">virtue signaling as a method of power</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.580" end="01:14:58.060" style="s2">and so that was the power is inexorable</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.900" end="01:14:59.950" style="s2">and then the power has virtue is since</p>

<p begin="01:18:23.510" end="01:18:27.830" style="s2">in you you just have to be aware of</p>

<p begin="01:18:30.500" end="01:18:34.880" style="s2">developmental idea is as soon as we talk</p>

<p begin="01:18:45.950" end="01:18:49.580" style="s2">thing without that actually being an</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.900" end="01:18:50.990" style="s2">embodied state and there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.580" end="01:18:53.000" style="s2">benefits to signaling that even</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.990" end="01:18:56.390" style="s2">earnestly even like the kid trying to</p>

<p begin="01:18:56.390" end="01:19:02.210" style="s2">how do we increase people&#39;s earnestness</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.960" end="01:19:03.830" style="s2">to work on the real embodiment of their</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.210" end="01:19:08.240" style="s2">virtues rather than the signaling of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.830" end="01:19:10.850" style="s2">them and the signaling only where that</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.240" end="01:19:13.520" style="s2">is actually necessary and effective for</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.850" end="01:19:15.860" style="s2">authentic purposes right right yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.520" end="01:19:17.960" style="s2">love that what came up when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:21:02.179" end="01:21:17.600" style="s2">cliffhanger on that and there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.020" end="01:21:19.400" style="s2">short book that I really loved that was</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.600" end="01:21:23.330" style="s2">one of the more influential books on me</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.400" end="01:21:26.750" style="s2">growing up it&#39;s by a Jesuit priest who</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.330" end="01:21:28.580" style="s2">is also a student of Eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.750" end="01:21:32.060" style="s2">named Anthony de Mello the book is</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.580" end="01:21:33.620" style="s2">called the way to love and it&#39;s a tiny</p>

<p begin="01:21:33.620" end="01:21:42.710" style="s2">reflections or meditations there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.380" end="01:21:46.010" style="s2">of ideas around sex that I would talk</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.710" end="01:21:47.630" style="s2">about that if people are not familiar</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.010" end="01:21:49.880" style="s2">with the ideas he brings up in there</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.630" end="01:21:53.270" style="s2">they won&#39;t actually have the basis for</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.880" end="01:21:54.140" style="s2">some of the value system so of course we</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.270" end="01:21:55.760" style="s2">can talk about it from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.140" end="01:21:58.690" style="s2">buy out perspective and we have to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.760" end="01:22:00.679" style="s2">that and an economic perspective and a</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.690" end="01:22:04.010" style="s2">child-rearing perspective and all those</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.679" end="01:22:08.690" style="s2">things but insofar as the question</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.010" end="01:22:10.550" style="s2">around you know you have the the</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.690" end="01:22:13.280" style="s2">Buddhist desire as the source of all</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.550" end="01:22:14.750" style="s2">suffering and the Western desire is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.280" end="01:22:17.360" style="s2">source of all creativity and goodness</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.750" end="01:22:18.590" style="s2">and we&#39;re here to be creators made in</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.360" end="01:22:20.449" style="s2">the image and likeness of the Creator</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.590" end="01:22:22.159" style="s2">those are really different models about</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.449" end="01:22:23.659" style="s2">the nature of desire and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.159" end="01:22:25.400" style="s2">something we kind of have to wrestle</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.659" end="01:22:26.840" style="s2">with and the whole topic of are there</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.400" end="01:22:28.280" style="s2">types of desire that are more</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.840" end="01:22:30.800" style="s2">destructive and types that are more</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.280" end="01:22:32.330" style="s2">healthfully constructive and do they</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.800" end="01:22:34.580" style="s2">come from different places is there</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.330" end="01:22:36.230" style="s2">desire from more wholeness or less</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.580" end="01:22:39.920" style="s2">wholeness that leads in a direction of</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.230" end="01:22:41.360" style="s2">kind of increased wholeness individually</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.920" end="01:22:43.310" style="s2">and for the relationships versus</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.360" end="01:22:45.530" style="s2">addiction whatever so there&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.310" end="01:22:49.190" style="s2">around that that becomes the basis to</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.530" end="01:22:51.190" style="s2">think about sexual desire and sexual</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.190" end="01:22:54.080" style="s2">rivalry and all those types of things so</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.190" end="01:22:55.850" style="s2">yeah I recommend it in that book and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.080" end="01:22:57.440" style="s2">will be particularly inclined to come</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.850" end="01:22:58.840" style="s2">back and talk about it if I hear that a</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.440" end="01:23:09.880" style="s2">bunch of people have read it</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.840" end="01:23:12.220" style="s2">oh I can jump in here film hi and yeah</p>

<p begin="01:23:22.300" end="01:23:25.360" style="s2">existential perverse here at the stoma</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.070" end="01:23:27.160" style="s2">so I think we&#39;re all gonna read that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.360" end="01:23:30.460" style="s2">book and then get you back to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.160" end="01:23:32.560" style="s2">it so Phil thanks for the I&#39;m seeing and</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.460" end="01:23:34.620" style="s2">Daniel thanks so much for coming today</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.560" end="01:23:36.460" style="s2">if people haven&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.620" end="01:23:38.200" style="s2">Wilhelm Reich&#39;s work was very</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.460" end="01:23:39.880" style="s2">interesting on the topic I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.200" end="01:23:42.000" style="s2">I agree with it but it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.880" end="01:23:44.770" style="s2">things it should be thought about he was</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.000" end="01:23:46.330" style="s2">basically saying what was wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.770" end="01:23:47.980" style="s2">Marxism and one of the things he</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.330" end="01:23:49.810" style="s2">assessed was that Marxism didn&#39;t deal</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.980" end="01:23:52.510" style="s2">with sexual ownership and the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.810" end="01:23:53.950" style="s2">impulse for non communitarian things</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.510" end="01:23:56.110" style="s2">that arises actually in how to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.950" end="01:23:58.150" style="s2">that and that became actually one of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.110" end="01:23:59.680" style="s2">deep intellectual basis of the free love</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.150" end="01:24:01.240" style="s2">movement which i think is not the right</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.680" end="01:24:04.270" style="s2">answer but just to kind of understand</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.240" end="01:24:05.500" style="s2">one of the directions and specifically</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.270" end="01:24:07.510" style="s2">it had to do with him looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.500" end="01:24:10.240" style="s2">relationship between sexual repression</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.510" end="01:24:13.470" style="s2">and violence across cultures which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.240" end="01:24:16.110" style="s2">very interesting sociologically and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.470" end="01:24:19.870" style="s2">almost like the follow-up to that work</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.110" end="01:24:23.110" style="s2">half a century later was sex at dawn hmm</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.870" end="01:24:25.570" style="s2">which was influenced by that and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.110" end="01:24:27.310" style="s2">valuable to read sexy dawn it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.570" end="01:24:28.960" style="s2">valuable to read the critiques of sex at</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.310" end="01:24:31.410" style="s2">dawn some of which are really deep and</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.960" end="01:24:34.600" style="s2">important some of which are specious and</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.410" end="01:24:35.860" style="s2">those are all kind of some basis to</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.600" end="01:24:38.500" style="s2">start to have the conversation a little</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.860" end="01:24:40.990" style="s2">more informally right I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.500" end="01:24:43.570" style="s2">book sex at dust it was a critic</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.990" end="01:24:45.040" style="s2">yeah yeah cool it&#39;s like largely</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.570" end="01:24:46.930" style="s2">specious but there&#39;s a few good things</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.040" end="01:24:48.490" style="s2">in there yes what I heard in century of</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.930" end="01:24:50.050" style="s2">the self has a pretty good mapping of</p>
