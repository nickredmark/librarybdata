<p begin="00:00:06.259" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">so Lina thank you for joining me welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.519" end="00:00:18.690" style="s2">pleasure so we&#39;re putting out a whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">series of films this week on what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.690" end="00:00:22.590" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s relationship to the left and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.550" end="00:00:26.070" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s relationship to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.590" end="00:00:29.220" style="s2">the left is a quite broad term and for</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.070" end="00:00:31.520" style="s2">me it also covers most people on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.220" end="00:00:33.960" style="s2">more progressive end of the spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.520" end="00:00:36.809" style="s2">I know that you&#39;ve got a real interest</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.960" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">in the developmental society although</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.809" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">sort of shared interests on how we move</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">towards a sort of more integration of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:45.559" style="s2">left and right so I&#39;m not sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">begging you as someone on the left but</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.559" end="00:00:50.030" style="s2">you&#39;re you would you agree that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:53.730" style="s2">more on the progressive end of society</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.030" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">no I think I&#39;m in the middle and I tried</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.730" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">to make my spectrum as before and wide</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:03.989" style="s2">and deep and with as many aspirations as</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">possible and I see a deep value in all</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.989" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">the democratic fractions that have had</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">so so I really try to see the full</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">spectrum and I think that is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">future what do you personally find</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">valuable in Jordan Peterson I find it</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:23.340" style="s2">very valuable that he has given a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:25.890" style="s2">complex understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:28.700" style="s2">conservative and the liberal even I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:32.310" style="s2">think his liberal version should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.700" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">divided and should be more nuanced and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.310" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">he has brought a lot of academic</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">knowledge and history and theology and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">psychology into the public sphere and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">into our conversation in society and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">has been almost impossible to bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">these topics into the broader debate the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">broader conversation so I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">really great I did love it because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:01:59.750" style="s2">means that we can talk about some things</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:02.100" style="s2">now for which we did not share</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.750" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">vocabulary before and that is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:05.969" style="s2">important and I also think and that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">why I Illustrated it like this is that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.969" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">mean if you up here I have absolute</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:13.710" style="s2">control and down here have absolute</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.630" style="s2">chaos order and Kay</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">this is the axis that the journey</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.630" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">Peterson is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">I mean libertarianism with outing</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">acceptance of all the other ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:29.310" style="s2">and of society will turn the world into</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:31.740" style="s2">chaos on the other hand if the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.310" end="00:02:35.130" style="s2">Conservatives or the Socialists gain</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:37.740" style="s2">absolute control and order it will be to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.130" end="00:02:40.830" style="s2">tell at Arianism all right I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.740" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">axis between order and chaos is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.830" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">is really a good tool and that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">inspired a lot hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:48.690" style="s2">I was gonna ask how your perspective has</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:56.190" style="s2">it changed your perspective on the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.690" end="00:02:58.860" style="s2">in any way no and one of the reasons is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.190" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">that many of the things that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.860" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">background in economy and theology I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:06.270" style="s2">never completed in my theology studies</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">so I know most of the mythology&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.270" end="00:03:11.700" style="s2">you talk that he talks about so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">they&#39;re not new to me I see them perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.700" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">in a slightly different light I also see</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.630" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">some things that he that he is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">completely missing particularly when it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:26.180" style="s2">comes to this whole thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:30.270" style="s2">patriarchy and the order in chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.180" end="00:03:34.290" style="s2">even parts of chaos and men know where</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.270" end="00:03:36.660" style="s2">the force of order I think both sexes</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.290" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">both genders contribute with order and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.660" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">chaos I don&#39;t think he defined it as men</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:47.780" style="s2">and women being ordering chaos he&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:51.210" style="s2">the masculine principle yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.780" end="00:03:55.880" style="s2">undifferentiated in some way does map</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.210" end="00:03:59.030" style="s2">onto Taoism and Buddhism when you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.880" end="00:04:02.660" style="s2">illustrations I mean there&#39;s the father</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.030" end="00:04:05.610" style="s2">standing for order and hero the son</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.660" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">being the creative I think he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.610" end="00:04:11.550" style="s2">the creative hero who is the one who can</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">transform the existing society into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.550" end="00:04:20.570" style="s2">next order of things that the next kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">of society and a more complex society</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.570" end="00:04:27.480" style="s2">they are men and the force of chaos has</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">portrayed us as the big mother so</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.480" end="00:04:32.130" style="s2">she&#39;s usually a woman so so there is but</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">yes the masculine and the feminine but</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.130" end="00:04:35.700" style="s2">if you look at the and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:38.730" style="s2">think he has this is really big blind</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.700" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">spot which is that all in the history</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.730" end="00:04:47.370" style="s2">that he is describing and interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:49.890" style="s2">and bringing into order it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.370" end="00:04:52.890" style="s2">written history so it&#39;s the history and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.890" end="00:04:57.480" style="s2">the mythology&#39;s of the Bronze Age Iron</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.890" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">Age and modernity you can evil times and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.480" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">the Renaissance but but it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:04.860" style="s2">written history and what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">about the written history from the dawn</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.860" end="00:05:11.180" style="s2">of picture racketing and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.710" end="00:05:14.070" style="s2">alphabet is that this coincides with</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.180" end="00:05:17.570" style="s2">bronze and iron it coincides with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.070" end="00:05:22.950" style="s2">axial age the big trade route between</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.570" end="00:05:25.470" style="s2">China and reason Italy so that axis</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.950" end="00:05:29.670" style="s2">geographical axis and the same planet so</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.470" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">and the first really big empires but</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.670" end="00:05:34.710" style="s2">before that there was still managed</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:38.060" style="s2">active culture which had a mother</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.710" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">goddess and that I was probably about</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.060" end="00:05:44.850" style="s2">fifteen thousand years of Stone Age</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:47.370" style="s2">agriculture maybe was just ten experts</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.850" end="00:05:50.490" style="s2">or debating right now and before that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.370" end="00:05:52.460" style="s2">that was hunter-gather stone age so join</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">me Peterson completely misses the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:06:00.890" style="s2">animism of the hunter-gatherers and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.940" end="00:06:05.370" style="s2">mother earth goddess of the early</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.890" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">farmers at least as far as will have</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.370" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">come in his maps of meaning I&#39;m still I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:13.290" style="s2">still have like sixty pages left there</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:17.880" style="s2">may be stuff that he that he hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.290" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">talked about yet but I got it so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.880" end="00:06:24.510" style="s2">the the mythology is that here analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:26.910" style="s2">and referring to are from the Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.510" end="00:06:30.660" style="s2">and Iron Age which is also the age of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.910" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">the patriarchy because when you live in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.660" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">an together</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:36.180" style="s2">group of maybe maximum two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:38.010" style="s2">people it&#39;s rather egalitarian you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.180" end="00:06:41.129" style="s2">have to keep order it by using violence</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.010" end="00:06:44.429" style="s2">if you live in a village</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.129" end="00:06:47.099" style="s2">Stone Age agriculture maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.429" end="00:06:49.439" style="s2">thousand people so yeah I have to use a</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.099" end="00:06:52.289" style="s2">bit of violence to keep the unruly</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.439" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">particularly young men common and make</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.289" end="00:06:58.019" style="s2">them behave but you don&#39;t have to build</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:07:01.139" style="s2">a hierarchy and so that is also the time</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.019" end="00:07:03.869" style="s2">span of the mother earth goddess and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.139" end="00:07:08.279" style="s2">were the early farmers they were really</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.869" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">I mean they how the you know the plants</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.279" end="00:07:13.229" style="s2">come up from the ground that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:16.740" style="s2">mother earth giving birth so she was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.229" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">organizing principle but then when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.740" end="00:07:20.729" style="s2">get into the Bronze Age and Iron Age and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:24.209" style="s2">you have some of these cities 3,000</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.729" end="00:07:26.490" style="s2">years ago with hello 100,000 people at</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.209" end="00:07:29.129" style="s2">least 10,000 people you get a different</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.490" end="00:07:32.009" style="s2">very different kind of power and that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.129" end="00:07:36.469" style="s2">also where male chauvinism begins you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.009" end="00:07:38.749" style="s2">can read from the texts so so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.469" end="00:07:41.399" style="s2">epistemology the frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.749" end="00:07:44.009" style="s2">within which during be Peterson is</p>

<p begin="00:07:44.009" end="00:07:50.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a part of our history where yes the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.579" end="00:07:52.079" style="s2">men struggled to create order in these</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.279" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">big societies and the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.079" end="00:07:57.089" style="s2">could do it was through religion through</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:59.789" style="s2">narrative through force through violence</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.089" end="00:08:03.539" style="s2">and the women became part of their</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.789" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">property and so you also have the manly</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.539" end="00:08:08.909" style="s2">going out to war should have them</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:11.909" style="s2">traveling for trade so you had men who</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.909" end="00:08:13.979" style="s2">travel from city to city or from village</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.909" end="00:08:17.339" style="s2">to village and when you travel you have</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.469" end="00:08:24.839" style="s2">and that creates a consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.899" end="00:08:27.719" style="s2">awareness that you don&#39;t get if you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.839" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">just stuck on the home with the children</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:42.689" style="s2">of risks to women in these societies and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.949" end="00:08:45.000" style="s2">so who ended up writing the mythology&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.689" end="00:08:47.189" style="s2">well the man once you can see beyond</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.000" end="00:08:49.170" style="s2">that and see what came before that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.189" end="00:08:51.389" style="s2">get a much richer perspective on who we</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.170" end="00:08:53.959" style="s2">are as as a civilization and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.389" end="00:08:55.450" style="s2">complex thing but but he does defend</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.959" end="00:08:57.580" style="s2">Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.450" end="00:09:01.570" style="s2">does defend the hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.580" end="00:09:03.610" style="s2">competence so you know in a way he does</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.570" end="00:09:07.690" style="s2">defend the system that some people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:09.400" style="s2">calling a patriarchy hey my nice where I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.690" end="00:09:13.750" style="s2">kind of align with what you&#39;re saying as</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.400" end="00:09:15.820" style="s2">well is that I do think that he that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.750" end="00:09:19.090" style="s2">it&#39;s altogether possible that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.820" end="00:09:22.810" style="s2">experiencing now is a shift from a sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.090" end="00:09:24.010" style="s2">of male way of looking at the world to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.810" end="00:09:26.290" style="s2">way of looking at the world that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.010" end="00:09:30.450" style="s2">incorporates the feminine and I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.290" end="00:09:32.410" style="s2">his his main focus is on reviving the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.450" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">reviving the masculine power of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.410" end="00:09:36.280" style="s2">culture and and actually I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:39.190" style="s2">necessary but it&#39;s potentially not</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.280" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">sufficient and what we actually is a is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.190" end="00:09:44.770" style="s2">a reinvigoration of the divine masculine</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:45.940" style="s2">if you want to see that but also for it</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.770" end="00:09:48.340" style="s2">to be match with the divine feminine</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.940" end="00:09:50.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve created a society where physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.340" end="00:09:54.060" style="s2">strength is no longer the defining thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.920" end="00:09:57.460" style="s2">we would hope so potentially the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.060" end="00:10:00.790" style="s2">potential for genuine equality and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.460" end="00:10:02.980" style="s2">genuine both both men and women</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.790" end="00:10:04.630" style="s2">connecting with their more so intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.980" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">direct ways of knowing if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.630" end="00:10:11.890" style="s2">potential for that it would seem so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:17.820" style="s2">I think that within within the within</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.890" end="00:10:20.080" style="s2">the known structures and epistemology of</p>

<p begin="00:10:20.080" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">Jordan B Peterson is doing a really good</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:31.780" style="s2">job and the irony is that in maps of</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.780" end="00:10:36.730" style="s2">staying remaining with the old</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.730" end="00:10:45.790" style="s2">changes then you are evil and what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.750" end="00:10:48.520" style="s2">don&#39;t see Jordan B Peters in doing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.790" end="00:10:50.650" style="s2">taking that step outside the known</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.520" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">epistemology becoming a creative hero</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">sharing with us what the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.410" end="00:11:02.500" style="s2">epistemology should look like what is</p>

<p begin="00:11:02.500" end="00:11:08.370" style="s2">organization of society and exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.250" end="00:11:09.460" style="s2">do we get both the male and the female</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.450" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">unique to young and are things that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.540" end="00:11:36.610" style="s2">don&#39;t really need anymore</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:39.399" style="s2">you don&#39;t allow anybody to have any</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.399" end="00:11:42.610" style="s2">some respects thank God for that because</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.140" end="00:11:44.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a much more civilized peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.610" end="00:11:48.279" style="s2">society but it also means that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.890" end="00:11:50.350" style="s2">this face where where young men are</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.279" end="00:11:51.790" style="s2">suffering and I think that Jordan P</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.350" end="00:11:54.370" style="s2">Peterson there&#39;s addressing that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.790" end="00:11:59.230" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very important group that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.370" end="00:12:01.420" style="s2">we are not helping there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.230" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">debate and especially in progressive</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.420" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">circles as to where the Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:07.959" style="s2">is a positive or a negative net</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:09.190" style="s2">influence and a lot of people come down</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.959" end="00:12:12.450" style="s2">on the side that he&#39;s a negative</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.450" end="00:12:16.510" style="s2">totally disagree Larry I think he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.890" end="00:12:19.570" style="s2">very positive influence because he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.790" end="00:12:44.650" style="s2">cannot build societies on post - why</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.610" end="00:12:46.990" style="s2">can&#39;t you build that society and post</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.650" end="00:12:48.580" style="s2">modernism well because post modernism is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.990" end="00:12:52.260" style="s2">about deconstruction and you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.580" end="00:12:54.700" style="s2">build structures on deconstruction so</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.260" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">there are really important insights from</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.700" end="00:13:00.430" style="s2">post modernism because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:02.709" style="s2">deconstruction and there&#39;s relativizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.430" end="00:13:04.630" style="s2">everything and the ability to switch</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.779" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">need the signs of modernity and</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.610" style="s2">really really crucial</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.420" end="00:13:29.970" style="s2">we need the narratives and the stories</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.610" end="00:13:34.019" style="s2">and the ethical moral struggles</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.910" end="00:13:48.029" style="s2">there&#39;s a poetic world and a symbolic</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.029" end="00:13:53.550" style="s2">and has things to say that science</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.690" end="00:13:55.950" style="s2">cannot say because it is not what</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.550" end="00:13:58.470" style="s2">science does what can guide us is wisdom</p>
