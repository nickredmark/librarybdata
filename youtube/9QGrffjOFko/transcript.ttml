<p begin="00:00:13.360" end="00:00:17.300" style="s2">yeah so since this is a follow-up piece</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.559" end="00:00:18.980" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna try and repeat any of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.300" end="00:00:21.710" style="s2">ideas that air people can check it out</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.980" end="00:00:24.050" style="s2">if they haven&#39;t already and the the gist</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.710" end="00:00:27.200" style="s2">of it was explaining some principles of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.050" end="00:00:28.820" style="s2">how propaganda works and how kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.200" end="00:00:32.180" style="s2">narrative warfare works and whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.820" end="00:00:33.920" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about through political</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.180" end="00:00:36.050" style="s2">process which we normally think of as</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.920" end="00:00:37.579" style="s2">propaganda or campaigning or through</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.050" end="00:00:39.770" style="s2">commercial process which we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.579" end="00:00:42.350" style="s2">marketing or the intersection of those</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.770" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">things or you know social movements</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.350" end="00:00:47.990" style="s2">which are basically movements that have</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:49.880" style="s2">some agenda that are trying to gain some</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.990" end="00:00:51.950" style="s2">kind of differential power that end up</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.880" end="00:00:53.480" style="s2">using narratives that coalesce people to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.950" end="00:00:55.880" style="s2">support them and use information that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.480" end="00:00:58.430" style="s2">coalesce as people to support them but</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.880" end="00:01:00.680" style="s2">where there ends up being distortions in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.430" end="00:01:02.720" style="s2">the narrative and the information to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.680" end="00:01:06.170" style="s2">support some agenda right and we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.720" end="00:01:07.490" style="s2">discussed how Vick witness that is and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.170" end="00:01:11.210" style="s2">how it happens and how social media</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.490" end="00:01:13.430" style="s2">makes it the social media and broadcasts</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.210" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">and all those technologies increase the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.430" end="00:01:19.930" style="s2">capacity to do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot on that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.930" end="00:01:25.340" style="s2">before people can do good sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:27.470" style="s2">may be one of the prerequisites is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.340" end="00:01:29.479" style="s2">before people can really focus on what</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.470" end="00:01:31.970" style="s2">our true beliefs and how do they know</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.479" end="00:01:34.370" style="s2">what a true belief is they have to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.970" end="00:01:36.860" style="s2">sure that they aren&#39;t being compelled to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.370" end="00:01:38.390" style="s2">believe not true or very partial things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.860" end="00:01:42.200" style="s2">as being less partial or more</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.390" end="00:01:43.760" style="s2">representative than they are and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.200" end="00:01:47.479" style="s2">goal of that piece was to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.760" end="00:01:49.100" style="s2">inoculate people against propaganda so</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.479" end="00:01:53.090" style="s2">that when it was happening they would at</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.100" end="00:01:56.659" style="s2">least recognize it and so because if</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.090" end="00:01:58.460" style="s2">someone holds false beliefs or holds</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.659" end="00:02:01.850" style="s2">true beliefs but that are very partial</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.460" end="00:02:03.799" style="s2">were held as more complete again in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.850" end="00:02:05.540" style="s2">being very distorted if someone holds</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.799" end="00:02:07.549" style="s2">distorted worldviews and then they try</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.540" end="00:02:09.409" style="s2">and do logic factoring those things as</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.549" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">true everything else will be affected by</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.409" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">distortion so not holding false or</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:16.370" style="s2">misrepresented beliefs or ideas is</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:18.139" style="s2">really fundamental to being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.370" end="00:02:20.540" style="s2">sense making and I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.139" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">wanting to talk about here is the next</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.540" end="00:02:23.610" style="s2">step in giving people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">fools to notice we&#39;re distortion is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">occurring to again further inoculate</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:30.540" style="s2">their sense making against distortion</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">and also recognize when they are a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.540" end="00:02:35.220" style="s2">source of distortion in the information</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:37.020" style="s2">ecology when they are actually engaging</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.220" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">in some form of narrative warfare maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.020" end="00:02:42.770" style="s2">without having done it the reason this</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:45.330" style="s2">came up is you and I talked about was</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.770" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">you know we&#39;re we&#39;re watching the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.330" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">comments and watching the shares and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">then watching in various groups where</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">people are discussing some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">and of course the fact that some people</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:55.709" style="s2">resonated was great that some people</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">agreed or disagreed or whatever all</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.709" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but I was witnessing places</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">where people were taking ideas about how</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">the information ecology is broken and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:10.860" style="s2">using them in ways that further broke</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">the information ecology they were you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.860" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">know like it&#39;s very easy to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">that some news is to some degree fake</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">and then assume or make the story that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:22.650" style="s2">it&#39;s the other side that has all fake</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:24.269" style="s2">news right which is now basically a fake</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.650" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">news strategy or a narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.269" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">strategy itself against the other guy</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">because as soon as you see that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">other guy the other side whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">is using information as a weapon then</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:36.690" style="s2">you can use the fact that they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:39.390" style="s2">information as a weapon as a weapon</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.690" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">itself to engage in that process and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.390" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">started seeing this happen and started</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">seeing like even in the comment thread</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:49.829" style="s2">where people&#39;s responses were not really</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">seeking to understand and engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.829" end="00:03:53.130" style="s2">process of deeper understanding they</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:03:55.260" style="s2">were seeking something else which was</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.130" end="00:03:58.760" style="s2">how to launch counter responses that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.260" end="00:04:01.109" style="s2">would either get likes or seem smart or</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.760" end="00:04:03.900" style="s2">position them securely at the center of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.109" end="00:04:07.290" style="s2">their in-group or you know whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.900" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">is and so and it wasn&#39;t just that video</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.290" end="00:04:17.579" style="s2">it was like you know I actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:23.390" style="s2">kind of an ethical culpability and any</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.579" end="00:04:25.500" style="s2">public sharing of tools right</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.390" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">metaphysical tools knowledge tools so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.500" end="00:04:29.970" style="s2">whether it is a psychological principle</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">or an insight or a cognitive or an</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.970" end="00:04:35.410" style="s2">epistemic tool or like a sense making or</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">frameworks kind of process or</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.410" end="00:04:44.140" style="s2">or or a virtue or a narrative that those</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">tools can be weaponized and especially</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.140" end="00:04:46.930" style="s2">in the context where almost everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:48.370" style="s2">is being weaponized because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.930" end="00:04:51.550" style="s2">feels like they&#39;re at war of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.370" end="00:04:52.810" style="s2">then what I don&#39;t want to be doing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:54.850" style="s2">what I know you don&#39;t want to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.810" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">as you know with rebel wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.850" end="00:04:59.140" style="s2">actually in the name of addressing</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:01.450" style="s2">culture wars to try and heal them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.140" end="00:05:03.880" style="s2">bringing thoughtful smart insightful</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.450" end="00:05:05.770" style="s2">people on something like rebel wisdom to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.880" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">share insights that those insights get</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.770" end="00:05:10.950" style="s2">taken in some distorted way and used to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">further culture war and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.950" end="00:05:16.300" style="s2">wanting to really address basically how</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:18.820" style="s2">all ideas can be weaponized all true</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.300" end="00:05:21.010" style="s2">ideas can be used for distorted purposes</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.820" end="00:05:24.910" style="s2">and to show how acquiesce that is and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.010" end="00:05:27.640" style="s2">show how almost every idea can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.910" end="00:05:29.890" style="s2">weaponized in multiple directions there</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.640" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">can be a pro and con case against almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.890" end="00:05:33.850" style="s2">any idea any virtue whatever and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:36.310" style="s2">reason I want to share this is so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.850" end="00:05:41.830" style="s2">people notice it when it&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.310" end="00:05:47.110" style="s2">other people and in themselves and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.830" end="00:05:50.230" style="s2">like this video is useful only if people</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.110" end="00:05:52.840" style="s2">are actually interested in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.230" end="00:05:56.320" style="s2">make better sense of the world like</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.840" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">actually hold more clear beliefs about</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.320" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">the nature of ground reality and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:04.210" style="s2">engage in earnest and in good faith with</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:07.960" style="s2">others to share sense making towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.210" end="00:06:10.780" style="s2">being able to make better choices to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.960" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">make a better world if someone is simply</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.780" end="00:06:16.450" style="s2">wanting to make sure their agenda wins</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">whatever that agenda happens to be that</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.450" end="00:06:20.920" style="s2">they&#39;re already sure enough that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:24.760" style="s2">right about then all of this will not be</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.920" end="00:06:27.580" style="s2">that helpful it except insofar as it can</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.760" end="00:06:30.340" style="s2">be weaponized so it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.580" end="00:06:34.030" style="s2">paradox that we spoke a lot in the last</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.340" end="00:06:36.910" style="s2">film about a more ethical and more</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.030" end="00:06:39.790" style="s2">grounded and more truthful sense making</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.910" end="00:06:43.419" style="s2">but even that language itself can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.790" end="00:06:47.710" style="s2">used for it can be weaponized and used</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.419" end="00:06:49.870" style="s2">for what pathological ends basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.710" end="00:06:53.650" style="s2">yeah when I you know pathological is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.870" end="00:06:55.930" style="s2">strong word and so I kind of want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.650" end="00:06:58.509" style="s2">speak to that self-serving is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.930" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">better what self-serving is good and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.509" end="00:07:03.550" style="s2">that ends up being pathological for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:05.830" style="s2">whole we&#39;re self-serving leads to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.550" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">different types of conflicts between</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.830" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">cells and between selves and Commons</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.410" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">then that ends up being pathological to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.180" end="00:07:21.190" style="s2">a larger scale right and oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:23.050" style="s2">people don&#39;t don&#39;t think they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.190" end="00:07:24.970" style="s2">engaging in a self-serving way they</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.050" end="00:07:27.340" style="s2">think they are engaging in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.970" end="00:07:29.050" style="s2">good for the world as they understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.340" end="00:07:31.990" style="s2">and as their in-group holds and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.050" end="00:07:33.970" style="s2">understands and it&#39;s hard for them to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.990" end="00:07:35.729" style="s2">think about engaging in good faith with</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.970" end="00:07:37.720" style="s2">people that they think are bad and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.729" end="00:07:40.660" style="s2">basically hurting what they care about</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.720" end="00:07:42.190" style="s2">so if people on the Left think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.660" end="00:07:44.789" style="s2">climate change is about to make the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.190" end="00:07:47.229" style="s2">entire planet uninhabitable and caused</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.020" end="00:07:56.380" style="s2">right that doesn&#39;t think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.400" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">climate denier is basically killing</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.380" end="00:07:59.229" style="s2">everything running the risk of killing</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:03.460" style="s2">them like the the true the good and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.780" end="00:08:05.530" style="s2">beautiful the right is actively seeking</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.460" end="00:08:06.970" style="s2">to her they&#39;re not trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.530" end="00:08:08.710" style="s2">them or engage in good faith they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.970" end="00:08:11.159" style="s2">just trying to win because those guys</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.710" end="00:08:13.810" style="s2">are clearly wrong and bad right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.159" end="00:08:17.259" style="s2">similarly if you&#39;re on the right and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.810" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">see that the left is trying to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.259" end="00:08:23.259" style="s2">the traditions that you hold as what has</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:25.330" style="s2">actually made it through the trials of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.259" end="00:08:28.020" style="s2">history that actually works and is good</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.330" end="00:08:30.849" style="s2">and is trying to basically destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.020" end="00:08:33.310" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to conserve which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.849" end="00:08:36.579" style="s2">what was true and good and beautiful you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.310" end="00:08:38.289" style="s2">believe that their science is distorted</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.579" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">and etc then simile you&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.289" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">engage in good faith so for the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:46.300" style="s2">part I don&#39;t think that people think</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:48.970" style="s2">they&#39;re engaging in bad faith or they</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.300" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">think they&#39;re self-serving they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.970" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">over certain about perspectives that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:09:07.100" style="s2">under complete the line that separates</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:10.250" style="s2">tools and weapons is not a clear line</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.100" end="00:09:12.050" style="s2">it&#39;s very fuzzy so let&#39;s think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.250" end="00:09:18.680" style="s2">physical tools and physical weapons for</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.050" end="00:09:24.500" style="s2">a moment a weapon is a tool to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.680" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">accomplish a goal in a adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.500" end="00:09:33.380" style="s2">context a tool is basically some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.690" style="s2">tech name kind of invention to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.380" end="00:09:38.149" style="s2">accomplish some kind of goal maybe or</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.690" end="00:09:40.070" style="s2">maybe not in an adversarial context we</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.149" end="00:09:42.440" style="s2">can see that most any tool that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.070" end="00:09:44.230" style="s2">developed for a knot weapon purpose</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.440" end="00:09:48.589" style="s2">could be weaponized if it needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.230" end="00:09:50.810" style="s2">so the kitchen cutting knife is a tool</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.589" end="00:09:52.100" style="s2">that is obviously to prepare food in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.810" end="00:09:53.630" style="s2">kitchen but it could be weaponized if</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.100" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">one needed it too and so could a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.630" end="00:09:58.459" style="s2">and so could a screwdriver and so could</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:01.550" style="s2">a chainsaw and so could a car right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.459" end="00:10:04.339" style="s2">could my laptop if I needed it to be and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.550" end="00:10:07.550" style="s2">so we can see that pretty much any tool</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.339" end="00:10:09.110" style="s2">can be made into a weapon actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.550" end="00:10:12.500" style="s2">not positive but I think the term</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.110" end="00:10:14.390" style="s2">weaponized which is now like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.500" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">most common terms and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.390" end="00:10:17.990" style="s2">important to understand why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:20.420" style="s2">common but very rarely does anyone say</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.990" end="00:10:22.310" style="s2">we&#39;re weaponizing stuff they typically</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.420" end="00:10:25.000" style="s2">say why someone of another group is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.310" end="00:10:31.670" style="s2">weaponizing things and what we&#39;ll see is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.000" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">like the exact same thing the same topic</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.670" end="00:10:35.540" style="s2">two different groups will say the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:42.829" style="s2">group is weaponizing a version of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.540" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">right but you know weaponizing safe</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.829" end="00:10:47.720" style="s2">space and vulnerability and whatever on</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:49.339" style="s2">the left side versus weaponizing free</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.720" end="00:10:51.890" style="s2">speech to just do hate speech on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.339" end="00:10:53.990" style="s2">right side right that kind of debate I</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.890" end="00:10:55.610" style="s2">think that the term weaponized was</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.990" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">actually coined or at least popularized</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.610" end="00:11:01.610" style="s2">in recent time after World War two by</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:03.410" style="s2">Wernher von Braun the Nazi rocket</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.610" end="00:11:05.720" style="s2">scientists that we brought to the US to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.410" end="00:11:07.500" style="s2">lead a lot of our rocket and also ICBM</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.720" end="00:11:10.350" style="s2">work and the Apollo project</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.500" end="00:11:12.510" style="s2">he was talking about taking the rocketry</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.350" end="00:11:13.770" style="s2">capabilities and things like Apollo and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.510" end="00:11:17.820" style="s2">being able to weaponize them by adding</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.770" end="00:11:19.290" style="s2">nukes to him and so that was basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.820" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">take a tool there&#39;s not a weapon and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.290" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">learn how to weaponize it and in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.130" style="s2">physical domain we can see that anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:29.580" style="s2">can be used as a weapon the same is true</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.130" end="00:11:31.470" style="s2">with metaphysical tools so psychological</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.580" end="00:11:33.840" style="s2">tools tools that can actually help shift</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.470" end="00:11:37.320" style="s2">people&#39;s psychology or cognitive tools</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.840" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">tools for sense making or communication</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.320" end="00:11:43.140" style="s2">tools right tools to be able to create</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:45.540" style="s2">rapport or to be able to influence of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.140" end="00:11:49.350" style="s2">other people&#39;s thought all of these and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.540" end="00:11:50.130" style="s2">even tools or principles or insights of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.350" end="00:11:53.070" style="s2">good behavior</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.130" end="00:11:57.810" style="s2">ie virtues or morals all of these can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.070" end="00:11:59.520" style="s2">used to advance some agenda in a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.810" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">that has some distortion and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.520" end="00:12:05.280" style="s2">creates some harm that&#39;s how I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:06.870" style="s2">to define weaponize and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.280" end="00:12:08.610" style="s2">that some of the way we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.870" end="00:12:10.950" style="s2">think about the demarcation between tool</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.610" end="00:12:13.400" style="s2">and weapon is that a weapon is going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.950" end="00:12:16.080" style="s2">be causing harm if it is deployed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.400" end="00:12:20.430" style="s2">that if it&#39;s not deployed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.080" end="00:12:22.890" style="s2">basically being used to avoid violence</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.430" end="00:12:24.930" style="s2">by saying we can commit violence right</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.890" end="00:12:29.790" style="s2">it is still its capacity to cause harm</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.930" end="00:12:31.830" style="s2">that is its basis of effectiveness well</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.790" end="00:12:33.570" style="s2">interestingly when we think about so</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.830" end="00:12:35.640" style="s2">many of the tools that we don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.570" end="00:12:37.890" style="s2">as weapons but we think of as just</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.640" end="00:12:39.510" style="s2">things that supported human life we</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.890" end="00:12:41.640" style="s2">could think of many of them as weapons</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.510" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">against nature right whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.640" end="00:12:44.310" style="s2">cutting down all the trees or harpooning</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:46.170" style="s2">whales or whatever like they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.310" end="00:12:48.420" style="s2">clearly weapons against somebody and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.170" end="00:12:51.900" style="s2">lot of the environmental harm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.420" end="00:12:54.210" style="s2">happened that is now making a much less</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.900" end="00:12:57.750" style="s2">hospitable planet for us to live on was</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.210" end="00:13:00.180" style="s2">actually those tools being weapons in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.750" end="00:13:02.370" style="s2">some context so this is actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.180" end="00:13:03.960" style="s2">deep thing to think about is man our</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.370" end="00:13:05.490" style="s2">ability to make tools makes us super</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.960" end="00:13:07.110" style="s2">powerful because of course the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.490" end="00:13:08.280" style="s2">animals just have their corporeal tools</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.110" end="00:13:09.570" style="s2">for the most part the tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.280" end="00:13:11.550" style="s2">built in and they don&#39;t get to up</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.570" end="00:13:13.500" style="s2">regulate the capacity of those quickly</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.550" end="00:13:15.390" style="s2">they operate very slowly with natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.500" end="00:13:17.400" style="s2">selection but we get up regulate ours</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.390" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">very quickly across lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.400" end="00:13:21.490" style="s2">areas and that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.240" end="00:13:26.350" style="s2">the capacity to destroy whole ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.490" end="00:13:28.810" style="s2">and to make new types of environment</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.350" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">cities and whatever into like actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.810" end="00:13:34.390" style="s2">engineer new species an extinct species</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:36.339" style="s2">so given that our ability to influence</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.390" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">the environment and others in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.339" end="00:13:40.990" style="s2">the capacity of our choice is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.170" end="00:13:42.610" style="s2">evolutionarily unprecedented because of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.990" end="00:13:44.410" style="s2">our tool making capacity and especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.610" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">as our tools keep getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.410" end="00:13:48.180" style="s2">powerful and our in the vertical izing</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:52.690" style="s2">part of an exponential technology curve</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.180" end="00:13:55.060" style="s2">given that our choice making capacities</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.200" end="00:14:26.709" style="s2">well right where we are using</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.610" end="00:14:29.050" style="s2">evolutionarily lower capacities more in</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.050" end="00:14:33.490" style="s2">while using evolutionarily higher</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.459" end="00:14:42.790" style="s2">our choice are going to be that powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.750" end="00:14:44.350" style="s2">they also have to be that considerate of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.790" end="00:14:45.970" style="s2">all of the second and third order</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.350" end="00:14:47.640" style="s2">effects of the application of that power</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.970" end="00:14:49.630" style="s2">so there&#39;s a level of consideration and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.640" end="00:14:51.550" style="s2">clarity of thinking and clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.630" end="00:14:56.230" style="s2">forecasting to be able to do clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.550" end="00:14:59.380" style="s2">design that has to increase and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.230" end="00:15:01.959" style="s2">that is our whole goal here is how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.380" end="00:15:05.230" style="s2">have the type of sense making that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.959" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">necessary to rightly steward the level</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.230" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">of power we have a non-destructive way</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.590" end="00:15:24.980" style="s2">I will probably start upsetting people</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.650" end="00:15:26.690" style="s2">now but sure so there is a narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.980" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">it&#39;s important to say I could give</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.690" end="00:15:34.250" style="s2">examples of this too for almost every</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.810" end="00:15:35.960" style="s2">narrative and I am quite happy to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.250" end="00:15:38.029" style="s2">that so if I&#39;m upsetting anyone I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.960" end="00:15:41.480" style="s2">hopefully should be upsetting everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.029" end="00:15:43.520" style="s2">kind of in the equal distribution that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.480" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">is doing what I think is some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.520" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">disingenuous narrative confirmation so</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:53.660" style="s2">let&#39;s look at the world view that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.170" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2">would call kind of naive techno optimism</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.660" end="00:16:03.410" style="s2">or techno capital optimism and we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.600" end="00:16:06.760" style="s2">see you know gates Steven Pinker Hans</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.410" end="00:16:09.980" style="s2">Rosling like there&#39;s a whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.760" end="00:16:14.630" style="s2">underlying thinking and so when you when</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.980" end="00:16:17.990" style="s2">you see statistics quoted by Hans or</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.630" end="00:16:19.490" style="s2">John Mackey or whatever that say the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.990" end="00:16:25.010" style="s2">world is doing better than it&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.490" end="00:16:27.230" style="s2">been because in 1850 X percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.010" end="00:16:29.300" style="s2">lived on less than a dollar 50 a day and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.230" end="00:16:30.620" style="s2">now only this tiny percent live on less</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.300" end="00:16:32.960" style="s2">than a dollar fifty a day therefore</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.620" end="00:16:35.630" style="s2">abundance is going up and that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.960" end="00:16:37.670" style="s2">better quality of life for everyone well</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.630" end="00:16:40.550" style="s2">that might actually be a true statistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:41.810" style="s2">that it went from 60 people to 18</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.550" end="00:16:43.130" style="s2">percent of people or something I forget</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.810" end="00:16:45.490" style="s2">what the exact statistic is that might</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.130" end="00:16:47.300" style="s2">be a true statistic but that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.490" end="00:16:49.190" style="s2">misrepresentative in some really</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.300" end="00:16:51.260" style="s2">important ways taken out of context that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.190" end="00:16:52.670" style="s2">in 1850 people&#39;s lives were mediated</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.260" end="00:16:54.670" style="s2">largely not by dollars a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.670" end="00:16:57.200" style="s2">people who they were talking about were</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.670" end="00:16:59.180" style="s2">lived in log cabins that they made</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.200" end="00:17:03.320" style="s2">themselves not mediated by dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.180" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">grew their own food and so the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.320" end="00:17:09.410" style="s2">dollars mediated their life actually is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:11.980" style="s2">not a good representation of economic</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.410" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">quality of life nor is the fact that now</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.980" end="00:17:18.620" style="s2">obesity which is mediated by you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:20.929" style="s2">more dollars is a radical cause of life</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.620" end="00:17:22.910" style="s2">expectancy challenges and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.929" end="00:17:24.470" style="s2">psychological and physical issues and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.910" end="00:17:27.620" style="s2">kind of rampant a new BIC witness and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.470" end="00:17:29.450" style="s2">you know when the story comes that there</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.620" end="00:17:32.150" style="s2">the world has always had violence and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.450" end="00:17:34.700" style="s2">we&#39;re less violent now well kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.150" end="00:17:36.860" style="s2">we&#39;re in a fairly short period of having</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.700" end="00:17:39.710" style="s2">to be less violent of certain kinds</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.860" end="00:17:42.080" style="s2">after developing the bomb but now the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.710" end="00:17:44.300" style="s2">the Bretton Woods convention that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.080" end="00:17:47.750" style="s2">mediated that has almost completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.300" end="00:17:50.540" style="s2">broken down we no longer have tension</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.750" end="00:17:53.090" style="s2">between two nuclear equipped superpowers</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.540" end="00:17:54.590" style="s2">but a multipolar situation where a force</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">nash equilibrium like meets you sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.590" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">destruction isn&#39;t even possible the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:02.270" style="s2">tensions in the situation are heat</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:04.820" style="s2">heating and yeah we never had weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.270" end="00:18:07.940" style="s2">AI drones before right we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.820" end="00:18:09.980" style="s2">CRISPR based bio weapon so like the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.940" end="00:18:12.290" style="s2">that there might be less violence of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.980" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">some kinds at the moment but radically</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.290" end="00:18:16.340" style="s2">more violence capacity and less ability</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:18.020" style="s2">to do anything effective towards it</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.340" end="00:18:20.360" style="s2">while orienting more towards it is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.020" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">stat that&#39;s not being or a it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.360" end="00:18:24.560" style="s2">stat you can&#39;t even make a proper stat</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:26.870" style="s2">on it it&#39;s a trendline that isn&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.560" end="00:18:29.000" style="s2">paid attention to nor is the radical</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.870" end="00:18:30.950" style="s2">amounts of species extinction or coral</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.000" end="00:18:33.560" style="s2">bleaching or micro plastics in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.950" end="00:18:37.550" style="s2">or rampant addiction rates or etc so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.560" end="00:18:39.230" style="s2">can take a true statistic out of context</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.550" end="00:18:41.870" style="s2">of all the things to assess and say</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.230" end="00:18:43.160" style="s2">quality of life is getting better I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.870" end="00:18:45.740" style="s2">take another true statistic and say</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.160" end="00:18:47.420" style="s2">quality of life is getting worse I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.740" end="00:18:49.190" style="s2">group some group of those statistics</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.420" end="00:18:50.750" style="s2">together to make a compelling argument</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.190" end="00:18:53.480" style="s2">with a book on either side</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.750" end="00:18:56.420" style="s2">and neither of them are representative</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.480" end="00:19:00.680" style="s2">of the whole picture and so something</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.420" end="00:19:06.260" style="s2">can be true in isolation but it is way</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.680" end="00:19:09.320" style="s2">too reductive and as a result is if</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.260" end="00:19:12.170" style="s2">shared as representative and isn&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.320" end="00:19:14.470" style="s2">actually a weapon to convince a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.170" end="00:19:18.770" style="s2">narrative that is not actually a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.470" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">reasonable narrative and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.770" end="00:19:23.000" style="s2">where I would say you know like when we</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:25.940" style="s2">look at climate change we have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.000" end="00:19:28.790" style="s2">like a Greta versus Trump narrative</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.940" end="00:19:32.210" style="s2">warfare on climate change right and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.790" end="00:19:33.410" style="s2">have people see letters circulating on</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.210" end="00:19:36.020" style="s2">Facebook depending upon which side</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.410" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">they&#39;re on that&#39;s a X number of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.020" end="00:19:39.890" style="s2">X percentage of scientists all agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">that climate change is real and both on</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:45.680" style="s2">paid by oil companies and then also X</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.090" end="00:19:47.630" style="s2">number of thousands of scientists say</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.680" end="00:19:49.190" style="s2">the Clinton the IPCC climate change</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.630" end="00:19:53.680" style="s2">thing is bunk and there&#39;s other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.190" end="00:19:57.410" style="s2">that we need to look at and who actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.680" end="00:19:59.090" style="s2">looks at the science in detail</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.390" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">bias to actually be able to sense make</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:08.120" style="s2">themselves they just defect to the</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.320" end="00:20:20.210" style="s2">isn&#39;t a problem and that framing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.900" end="00:20:22.490" style="s2">even the right conversation because we</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.210" end="00:20:24.740" style="s2">look at okay what are the arguments for</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.900" end="00:25:43.730" style="s2">again look to see are there true</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.790" end="00:25:47.110" style="s2">insights and critiques in there and can</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.730" end="00:25:49.550" style="s2">you factor them to understand them and</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.130" end="00:25:57.020" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very very easy step so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.100" end="00:25:58.580" style="s2">speaking to why it&#39;s important because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.020" end="00:26:02.420" style="s2">think that we have more issues in the</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.929" end="00:26:23.540" style="s2">of war that is beyond just on Facebook I</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.280" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">think that we have more different issues</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.540" end="00:26:30.020" style="s2">on more fronts that are more</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.250" end="00:26:52.730" style="s2">and that is a movement towards warfare</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.210" end="00:26:54.890" style="s2">in a time that is one that&#39;s never</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.040" end="00:27:10.970" style="s2">totally suck and where the weapons</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.350" end="00:27:14.390" style="s2">technology we have is unlike anything</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.970" end="00:27:16.370" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever had like we can see that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.390" end="00:27:19.730" style="s2">these types of patterns have happened in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.370" end="00:27:21.740" style="s2">the past and led to war and resets and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.730" end="00:27:27.370" style="s2">think that that&#39;s too costly to happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.740" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2">again and so outside of everyone</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:42.130" style="s2">as a weapon right that tie</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.120" end="00:30:46.420" style="s2">of social shaming as a type of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.130" end="00:30:47.980" style="s2">weapon when any like in a physical war</p>

<p begin="00:30:54.520" end="00:30:58.660" style="s2">that when you think like oh we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.770" end="00:31:00.310" style="s2">some new narrative that&#39;s gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:31:11.320" end="00:31:20.260" style="s2">and so we can see that the coalescing of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.990" end="00:31:22.870" style="s2">and the kind of concretization of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.260" end="00:31:27.340" style="s2">alright was to a large degree in</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.340" end="00:31:31.480" style="s2">social shaming tools which didn&#39;t come</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.330" end="00:31:58.330" style="s2">guy again and so and you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.750" end="00:31:59.710" style="s2">similar kinds of tools used on the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.330" end="00:32:06.870" style="s2">for being able to create in group</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.849" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">has that surprised you the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.000" end="00:35:00.550" style="s2">there is a ambiguous idea like game B</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:03.160" style="s2">which is kind of a placeholder for what</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.550" end="00:35:05.700" style="s2">would a healthier civilization be then</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.160" end="00:35:08.610" style="s2">to the degree that that starts getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.700" end="00:35:12.250" style="s2">traction and people are interested</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.610" end="00:35:13.810" style="s2">people being associated with it because</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.250" end="00:35:16.330" style="s2">it&#39;s getting traction and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.810" end="00:35:18.760" style="s2">there will be power there whether their</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.330" end="00:35:21.100" style="s2">motives are really of game B or not is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.760" end="00:35:22.810" style="s2">obviously going to happen and then also</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.100" end="00:35:26.170" style="s2">people trying to capture the flag and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.810" end="00:35:29.850" style="s2">say game B is dot dot dot the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.170" end="00:35:40.090" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is also going to happen so</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.850" end="00:35:45.250" style="s2">I I think actually you know placing a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.090" end="00:35:47.380" style="s2">flag like that that attracts capture is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.250" end="00:35:48.700" style="s2">not a straightforwardly good idea I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.380" end="00:35:49.810" style="s2">not saying it&#39;s definitely a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.700" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s definitely not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.810" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">straightforwardly good idea and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:36:00.820" style="s2">conversations like this hopefully can</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:03.160" style="s2">lead to more more earnest exploration on</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.820" end="00:36:07.240" style="s2">our own part not even not calling each</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.160" end="00:36:11.260" style="s2">other out like there is a time this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.240" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">again there&#39;s a way to help support</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.260" end="00:36:14.200" style="s2">collective intelligence that if we see</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:16.030" style="s2">someone doing something that we think is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.200" end="00:36:18.730" style="s2">off that we share it in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.030" end="00:36:19.180" style="s2">actually a good face trying to help them</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.730" end="00:36:21.190" style="s2">do better</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.180" end="00:36:23.530" style="s2">there&#39;s also another method of call out</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.190" end="00:36:27.670" style="s2">culture that is really just a weapon to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.530" end="00:36:29.530" style="s2">take out people who are not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.670" end="00:36:32.850" style="s2">narrative that we&#39;re creating you and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.530" end="00:36:37.990" style="s2">saw in certain online forums</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.850" end="00:36:39.580" style="s2">conversations I think I think Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.990" end="00:36:41.140" style="s2">Hall and Jamie wheel and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.580" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">conversation sitting right here on this</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.140" end="00:36:48.090" style="s2">couch and we talked about rule Omega and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:48.090" style="s2">that was shared and then we saw people</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:57.460" style="s2">invoking rule Omega when as a tactic to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.250" end="00:36:59.530" style="s2">get other people to include them in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.460" end="00:37:01.840" style="s2">conversation where the the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.530" end="00:37:05.770" style="s2">showed up in conversation did not compel</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.840" end="00:37:07.720" style="s2">the other people to include them and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.770" end="00:37:09.640" style="s2">way we actually articulate rule Omega is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.720" end="00:37:10.770" style="s2">that it cannot be invoked by others it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.640" end="00:37:13.420" style="s2">has to be granted</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:15.580" style="s2">shall we just recap what rule Omega is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.420" end="00:37:20.500" style="s2">it&#39;s basically giving the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.580" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">doubt and calling out assuming the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.500" end="00:37:24.920" style="s2">person is trying to express some</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:27.290" style="s2">meaningful and helping to tease that out</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.920" end="00:37:30.650" style="s2">in the interaction so rather than mixing</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.290" end="00:37:32.540" style="s2">it yeah and so rule Omega is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.650" end="00:37:36.470" style="s2">of process where with those we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.540" end="00:37:40.070" style="s2">seeking to collaborate we grant a level</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.470" end="00:37:42.770" style="s2">of giving the benefit of the doubt you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.070" end="00:37:46.340" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do this with everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.770" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">like if if somebody comes up to me on</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.340" end="00:37:51.980" style="s2">the street and they seem like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:55.160" style="s2">trying to con me in some way I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.980" end="00:37:57.110" style="s2">give them Rule megha and assume that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.160" end="00:37:58.850" style="s2">they have good intention and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.110" end="00:38:01.250" style="s2">are thoughtful that would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.850" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">done and if someone is engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.250" end="00:38:06.290" style="s2">mostly rhetoric with me and they they</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:08.900" style="s2">also don&#39;t seem that they are seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.290" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">understand clearly that it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.900" end="00:38:16.910" style="s2">not warranted and so rule omegas this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:18.530" style="s2">basically when I am trying to engage</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.910" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">with people who might think differently</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.530" end="00:38:22.070" style="s2">but I think that I&#39;m not positive that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:24.110" style="s2">I&#39;m right and they&#39;re wrong if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.070" end="00:38:25.970" style="s2">difference if there&#39;s a difference I</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.110" end="00:38:28.940" style="s2">think I might possibly have something to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.970" end="00:38:30.980" style="s2">learn then R Omega is how I would engage</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.940" end="00:38:32.870" style="s2">that would best increase my chance of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.980" end="00:38:34.940" style="s2">learning the thing which is only</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.870" end="00:38:36.500" style="s2">interested only relevant if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.940" end="00:38:38.120" style="s2">learn stuff that I maybe don&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.500" end="00:38:40.220" style="s2">know and especially learn stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.120" end="00:38:42.530" style="s2">might even be different than stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.220" end="00:38:43.940" style="s2">feels actually important to me and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.530" end="00:38:45.500" style="s2">is where there is a courage and an</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.940" end="00:38:47.660" style="s2">earnestness and the sincerity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.500" end="00:38:49.190" style="s2">really critical now there&#39;s a level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.660" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">give the benefit of the doubt that in</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.190" end="00:38:54.470" style="s2">general is a nice rule of thumb to err</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:56.450" style="s2">in the direction of right try and hear</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.470" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">where someone is coming from but when</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.450" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">someone else is on the offense in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">actively kind of weaponized way or</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:03.820" style="s2">whatever I might not do that I also have</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:06.020" style="s2">the right to not engage with someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.820" end="00:39:07.370" style="s2">factoring the very limited time of life</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.020" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">that I have and that I can&#39;t engage with</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.370" end="00:39:12.080" style="s2">everyone that doesn&#39;t feel like the best</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:13.430" style="s2">use of my time to advance the the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.080" end="00:39:15.110" style="s2">that I care most about even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.430" end="00:39:17.090" style="s2">caring for everyone I might not see that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.110" end="00:39:19.880" style="s2">as the right place to go so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.090" end="00:39:21.830" style="s2">says rule Omega give the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.880" end="00:39:23.630" style="s2">doubt therefore you have to listen to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.830" end="00:39:25.880" style="s2">and engage with me and answer all my</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.630" end="00:39:27.260" style="s2">responses that&#39;s actually weaponizing</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.260" end="00:39:33.100" style="s2">and there are similar things where</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.760" end="00:39:39.270" style="s2">we were referencing I don&#39;t remember the</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.470" end="00:41:42.480" style="s2">regulate their public presence or</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.330" end="00:41:44.340" style="s2">profile or something now it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:47.700" style="s2">honeypot that&#39;s going to attract people</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.340" end="00:41:51.810" style="s2">for actually exactly gamej reasons 2x</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.700" end="00:41:53.490" style="s2">floette gained the virtue right and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.810" end="00:41:54.750" style="s2">this is the virtue signaling thing which</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.490" end="00:41:57.480" style="s2">is actually maybe a good thing for us to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.750" end="00:42:00.119" style="s2">talk about now insofar as game B&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.480" end="00:42:03.180" style="s2">talking about a better world insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.119" end="00:42:05.070" style="s2">it has epistemic how do we do better</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.180" end="00:42:06.450" style="s2">sense making those epistemic scan be</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.070" end="00:42:08.369" style="s2">weaponized and we can talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.450" end="00:42:10.619" style="s2">critical thinking and how dialectics and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.369" end="00:42:13.800" style="s2">whatever can be weaponized but insofar</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.619" end="00:42:16.140" style="s2">as it&#39;s also talking about not just what</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.800" end="00:42:17.700" style="s2">is true but what is good right like in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.140" end="00:42:20.940" style="s2">the true the good in the beautiful kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.700" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">of sense what are we what are the kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.940" end="00:42:25.410" style="s2">of world were wanting to build then of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:28.650" style="s2">course any virtue can be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.410" end="00:42:31.079" style="s2">which is virtue signaling and again</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.650" end="00:42:32.490" style="s2">these I&#39;m talking about topics that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.079" end="00:42:34.320" style="s2">everybody is talking about right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.490" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">just hopefully trying to talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.320" end="00:42:38.700" style="s2">in a slightly different way to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:41.400" style="s2">everyone on all sides is are oriented to</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.700" end="00:42:44.250" style="s2">do versions of this as opposed to those</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.400" end="00:42:46.530" style="s2">guys are virtue signaling and us calling</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.250" end="00:42:48.380" style="s2">them out is us demonstrating our actual</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.530" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">virtue but we&#39;re not virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.380" end="00:42:54.599" style="s2">and so one way that I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:58.680" style="s2">distinction between real virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.599" end="00:43:02.010" style="s2">virtue signaling is virtue signaling is</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.680" end="00:43:04.530" style="s2">when it&#39;s clear that an enough people</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.010" end="00:43:07.380" style="s2">hold a particular trait as a virtue that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.530" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">if I seem to have that virtue it would</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.380" end="00:43:11.130" style="s2">be good for me right the people would</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:14.130" style="s2">like me accept me agree with me buy my</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.130" end="00:43:16.589" style="s2">stuff like my ideas whatever it is so if</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.130" end="00:43:19.829" style="s2">I signal if I communicate in some way</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.589" end="00:43:22.440" style="s2">that I have that virtue it&#39;s beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.829" end="00:43:25.800" style="s2">for me in straight self-serving ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.440" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">right so I have a reason to signal the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.800" end="00:43:31.380" style="s2">virtue beyond my authentic living of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:33.079" style="s2">and this is where rather than I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.380" end="00:43:36.780" style="s2">doing what I&#39;m doing and people notice</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.079" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">the virtue that I happen to to be living</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.780" end="00:43:41.160" style="s2">I am intentionally trying to seem</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:42.780" style="s2">virtuous of a particular kind more than</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.160" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">I am trying to actually live that thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.780" end="00:43:48.900" style="s2">right and this is where the you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:50.760" style="s2">Jesus saying don&#39;t let the right hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.900" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">see what the left hand was doing and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.760" end="00:43:54.990" style="s2">think every culture that has wisdom has</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:57.300" style="s2">some quotes like that because virtue</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.990" end="00:43:58.680" style="s2">signaling has is forever right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.300" end="00:43:59.970" style="s2">whatever the dominant culture is</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.680" end="00:44:01.010" style="s2">whatever the thing that is seen as</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.970" end="00:44:06.500" style="s2">virtue there</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.010" end="00:44:10.580" style="s2">so during you know during the early</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.500" end="00:44:13.630" style="s2">Soviet empire Marxist ideology people</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.580" end="00:44:14.780" style="s2">would virtue signal being more Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.630" end="00:44:18.109" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.780" end="00:44:19.960" style="s2">and during Dark Age Catholic reign the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.109" end="00:44:23.600" style="s2">virtuous signaling was about being</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.960" end="00:44:25.369" style="s2">better Catholics and you know so now</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.600" end="00:44:28.210" style="s2">left and right have their own versions</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.369" end="00:44:34.820" style="s2">of virtue signaling to their own base</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.210" end="00:44:37.369" style="s2">and so politicians and companies and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.820" end="00:44:38.570" style="s2">social leaders are oriented to signal</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.369" end="00:44:45.650" style="s2">the thing they would need to in that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.570" end="00:44:49.270" style="s2">a real virtue is something that is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.650" end="00:44:53.140" style="s2">I care about that I value actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.270" end="00:44:56.450" style="s2">hopefully something that is sacred to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.140" end="00:44:59.780" style="s2">that I am willing to experience personal</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.450" end="00:45:01.130" style="s2">sacrifice for not that my signalling of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.780" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">it creates personal gain but I am</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.130" end="00:45:05.330" style="s2">willing to lose personal gain in service</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:07.880" style="s2">of this because it&#39;s more important than</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.330" end="00:45:10.670" style="s2">personal gain to me so I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.880" end="00:45:13.340" style="s2">lose some dollars to have my company not</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.670" end="00:45:15.109" style="s2">do that thing because I hold a virtue or</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.340" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">an ethic that won&#39;t have me do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.109" end="00:45:18.500" style="s2">thing even if it would make me more</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:20.830" style="s2">dollars or I&#39;m willing to lose some</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:23.090" style="s2">followers or get some not you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.830" end="00:45:24.080" style="s2">people dislike what I&#39;m saying or</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.090" end="00:45:25.820" style="s2">whatever to stand up for something</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.080" end="00:45:28.730" style="s2">because I actually meaningfully believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.820" end="00:45:30.140" style="s2">in it right most people are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.730" end="00:45:32.660" style="s2">be disliked by the group that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.140" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">identify as enemies though they might</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.660" end="00:45:35.570" style="s2">even take pride in it because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:39.710" style="s2">doing in-group out-group Machiavellian</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.570" end="00:45:41.150" style="s2">stuff but am I willing to lose likes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.710" end="00:45:42.730" style="s2">support by the people that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.150" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">in group with is where it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.730" end="00:45:45.410" style="s2">consequential because losing the ones</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:47.180" style="s2">that I&#39;ve already lost isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.410" end="00:45:48.800" style="s2">consequential so then I get to weaponize</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.180" end="00:45:50.450" style="s2">see I&#39;m willing to make a sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.800" end="00:45:54.850" style="s2">have enemies which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.450" end="00:45:58.100" style="s2">weaponizing the idea of sacrifice itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.850" end="00:45:59.030" style="s2">we can also see that so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.100" end="00:46:02.060" style="s2">difference between virtue and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.030" end="00:46:03.800" style="s2">signaling is real virtue is not trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.060" end="00:46:05.570" style="s2">to signal to other people something it</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.800" end="00:46:07.850" style="s2">is trying to actually live something and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.570" end="00:46:10.850" style="s2">it is willing to stand for something</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.850" end="00:46:13.880" style="s2">where it is personally disadvantageous</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.850" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">and so you can see someone&#39;s virtue in</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.880" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:19.340" style="s2">series of choices they have made that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:20.810" style="s2">have been hard choices so when someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.340" end="00:46:22.550" style="s2">tells me that they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.810" end="00:46:24.980" style="s2">impact investing with their financial</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.550" end="00:46:27.890" style="s2">services fund I go through and I say</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.980" end="00:46:30.680" style="s2">show me in record the series of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.890" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">investment choices you made where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.680" end="00:46:36.220" style="s2">turn down money because of an ethic just</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:38.300" style="s2">show me the the record of those and</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.220" end="00:46:41.570" style="s2">usually they can&#39;t do a good job at that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.300" end="00:46:44.180" style="s2">and then I say off because I know</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.570" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">that now impact investing just happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.180" end="00:46:48.430" style="s2">to be the virtue that signals a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:51.020" style="s2">particular niche of capital or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.430" end="00:46:58.970" style="s2">but there&#39;s no real earnestness in it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.020" end="00:47:00.950" style="s2">right so I was having a conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.970" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">other day with somebody about this and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.950" end="00:47:11.600" style="s2">was thinking about the kind of virtues</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:14.359" style="s2">the kind of self sacrifice and courage</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.600" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">and valor and heroism that would have</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.359" end="00:47:24.680" style="s2">someone jump on a grenade to protect</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:27.470" style="s2">their fellows and how profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.680" end="00:47:30.470" style="s2">beautiful and incredible that impulses</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.470" end="00:47:34.540" style="s2">and that actual developed capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.470" end="00:47:37.790" style="s2">commitment in oneself and then the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.540" end="00:47:40.790" style="s2">that other people weaponize the most</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.790" end="00:47:43.220" style="s2">beautiful traits in someone right so</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.790" end="00:47:45.470" style="s2">like develop soldiers that have that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.220" end="00:47:47.180" style="s2">virtue and then apply them to a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.470" end="00:47:48.500" style="s2">false-flag war where they&#39;re told the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.180" end="00:47:51.290" style="s2">war is for one reason and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.500" end="00:47:53.210" style="s2">really the reason that it&#39;s for so those</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.290" end="00:47:58.460" style="s2">who are running the false flag war are</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.210" end="00:48:01.910" style="s2">weaponizing the energy of patriotism of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.460" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">self-sacrifice of whatever in people and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.910" end="00:48:09.800" style="s2">we can see that like as you know suicide</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:11.690" style="s2">bombing where a young person is willing</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.800" end="00:48:13.340" style="s2">to give up their life in service of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.690" end="00:48:16.040" style="s2">thing that they believe is right only</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.340" end="00:48:18.590" style="s2">when the infidels are gone well you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.040" end="00:48:20.750" style="s2">the world be remade and and I&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.590" end="00:48:22.760" style="s2">back and etc and like that the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.750" end="00:48:24.470" style="s2">people are actually infidels they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.760" end="00:48:27.090" style="s2">against God and against a good and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.470" end="00:48:33.990" style="s2">they&#39;re doing the holy thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.090" end="00:48:38.190" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s clearly some people who are</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.980" end="00:48:48.660" style="s2">strategic things who then end up</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.840" end="00:48:50.280" style="s2">weaponizing those people&#39;s deepest</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.390" end="00:49:18.180" style="s2">think about we talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:20.310" style="s2">but when we think about things like</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.180" end="00:49:23.700" style="s2">christian holy war when think about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.310" end="00:49:27.990" style="s2">inquisition and it&#39;s like okay so people</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.700" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">who are claiming to believe in Jesus as</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.990" end="00:49:33.780" style="s2">the Savior who said let he who has no</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:36.090" style="s2">sins cast the first stone and if they</p>

<p begin="00:49:38.070" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">on all these types of things and Father</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.990" end="00:49:45.240" style="s2">forgive them for they know not what they</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:47.010" style="s2">do how we figure out in the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.240" end="00:49:48.990" style="s2">religion that believes in him to torture</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.990" end="00:49:54.030" style="s2">them at the stake it&#39;s like what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.670" end="00:49:56.700" style="s2"> how do we figure out how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.030" end="00:50:00.180" style="s2">well there&#39;s a there&#39;s easy ways he also</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.700" end="00:50:01.650" style="s2">said you know I come not to destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.180" end="00:50:03.210" style="s2">law but to uphold it and then I can go</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.650" end="00:50:04.350" style="s2">back to Leviticus and then I can see</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.210" end="00:50:09.900" style="s2">where we were supposed to kill people</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.350" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">and whatever right so basically so there</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.900" end="00:50:16.140" style="s2">are individuals who take tools and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">weaponize them in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.140" end="00:50:21.900" style="s2">other individuals there are also</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:24.930" style="s2">individuals and groups and positions of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.900" end="00:50:27.770" style="s2">power that seek to weaponize groups of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.930" end="00:50:31.110" style="s2">people and so they seek to share</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.770" end="00:50:32.700" style="s2">compelling narratives to scare people to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.110" end="00:50:34.560" style="s2">create a false enemy that will scare</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.700" end="00:50:36.630" style="s2">everyone and unify them together against</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.560" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">that enemy that was either created or</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.630" end="00:50:40.380" style="s2">exaggerated to begin with or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:42.299" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.380" end="00:50:44.509" style="s2">they are basically weaponizing people</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.299" end="00:50:46.799" style="s2">and people&#39;s courage to be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.509" end="00:50:51.930" style="s2">step up and fight so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.799" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">weaponizing that which is most beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.930" end="00:51:02.759" style="s2">and other people for the most</p>

<p begin="00:51:02.759" end="00:51:10.019" style="s2">examples of all the things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:12.049" style="s2">Mis applied and you know weaponizing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.019" end="00:51:17.220" style="s2">a strong term for all of the cases but</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.049" end="00:51:18.599" style="s2">but yes applied with some intention that</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.220" end="00:51:21.900" style="s2">has some knowing or not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.599" end="00:51:24.119" style="s2">distortion and some harm that will there</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.900" end="00:51:26.759" style="s2">is no doubt or not that will occur from</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.119" end="00:51:30.690" style="s2">it we can talk about the weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.759" end="00:51:32.250" style="s2">of science the philosophy of science and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.690" end="00:51:33.720" style="s2">even more the practice of science and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.250" end="00:51:37.309" style="s2">the funding of science we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.720" end="00:51:37.309" style="s2">the weaponization of philanthropy of</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.269" end="00:51:42.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about the weaponization of</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.859" end="00:51:44.279" style="s2">market dynamics quite a lot we could</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.930" end="00:51:46.650" style="s2">also talk about the weaponization of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.279" end="00:51:48.089" style="s2">critique of market dynamics to to then</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.650" end="00:51:51.180" style="s2">promote other things that are even</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.089" end="00:51:54.029" style="s2">nummer we can talk about where</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.180" end="00:51:56.220" style="s2">postmodern ideas became weaponized and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.029" end="00:51:59.849" style="s2">then also over reactive critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.220" end="00:52:01.289" style="s2">post-modernism became weaponized we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.849" end="00:52:03.390" style="s2">look at where critical thinking was</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.289" end="00:52:05.670" style="s2">supposed to be a tool to help identify</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.390" end="00:52:07.529" style="s2">these things and it itself can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.670" end="00:52:10.380" style="s2">weaponized in many cases to lead to</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.529" end="00:52:11.930" style="s2">people who are overconfident and just</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.380" end="00:52:15.269" style="s2">simply looking for tools of rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.930" end="00:52:17.339" style="s2">that have very little actual curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.269" end="00:52:19.259" style="s2">and are trying to support certainty</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.339" end="00:52:20.940" style="s2">rather than the kind of comfort with</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.259" end="00:52:22.140" style="s2">uncertainty that is of the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.940" end="00:52:27.690" style="s2">earnestness in the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.140" end="00:52:30.470" style="s2">itself so you this would be a impossibly</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.690" end="00:52:34.369" style="s2">long video if we got into all of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.470" end="00:52:37.710" style="s2">but we could write we could look at</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.369" end="00:52:39.829" style="s2">examples of the applications of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.710" end="00:52:43.740" style="s2">that I think are pretty badly weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.829" end="00:52:50.009" style="s2">and of you know pick the religion picked</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.740" end="00:52:52.049" style="s2">or whatever and and yet also examples of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.009" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">things that are authentically good</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.049" end="00:52:58.050" style="s2">meaningful and maybe even necessary</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:59.610" style="s2">in all those places so hopefully we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.050" end="00:53:02.490" style="s2">covered enough that there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.610" end="00:53:04.350" style="s2">examples that people can start to think</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.490" end="00:53:06.210" style="s2">through them and I think one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.350" end="00:53:08.370" style="s2">interesting things would be if people</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.210" end="00:53:10.140" style="s2">did and started to give examples of</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.370" end="00:53:13.050" style="s2">where they have seen this occur in</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.140" end="00:53:14.580" style="s2">various domains and especially if they</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.050" end="00:53:15.870" style="s2">didn&#39;t just give the examples of where</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.580" end="00:53:19.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve seen the people that they feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.870" end="00:53:21.540" style="s2">are other do it but that where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.680" end="00:53:23.070" style="s2">seen groups that they identify with do</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.540" end="00:53:25.350" style="s2">it and maybe where they can see both</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.070" end="00:53:27.390" style="s2">sides of a debate both in doing some</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.350" end="00:53:30.600" style="s2">kind of weaponizing and what engaging</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.390" end="00:53:32.430" style="s2">without that might look like if if there</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.600" end="00:53:33.960" style="s2">could start to be in the Facebook groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.430" end="00:53:36.030" style="s2">and then the YouTube thread like people</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.960" end="00:53:44.040" style="s2">actually discussing that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.030" end="00:53:45.450" style="s2">generative and of course YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.040" end="00:53:47.490" style="s2">degenerate enough there would be trolls</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.450" end="00:53:49.980" style="s2">what I&#39;m hoping is that most people</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.490" end="00:53:52.410" style="s2">recognize that they themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.980" end="00:53:55.860" style="s2">sometimes susceptible to a subclinical</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.410" end="00:53:57.450" style="s2">degree of troll them where they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.860" end="00:53:59.930" style="s2">full-blown trolls but they&#39;re also not</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.450" end="00:54:06.720" style="s2">engaging in the most generative way and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.930" end="00:54:09.450" style="s2">hopefully seek to do better yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:11.960" style="s2">troll spectrum we&#39;re hoping to move</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.450" end="00:54:11.960" style="s2">people down</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.099" end="00:54:21.279" style="s2">to share here I don&#39;t believe that I am</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.660" end="00:54:23.559" style="s2">an expert in any of the topics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.279" end="00:54:26.410" style="s2">talking about right now I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.559" end="00:54:27.789" style="s2">about them because there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.410" end="00:54:29.979" style="s2">phenomena that are quite clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.789" end="00:54:31.959" style="s2">that I see happening in this space that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.979" end="00:54:33.940" style="s2">I want to address and I don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.959" end="00:54:36.489" style="s2">being addressed yet and I actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.940" end="00:54:38.410" style="s2">a certain responsibility to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.489" end="00:54:40.569" style="s2">that insofar as we have shared insights</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.410" end="00:54:41.769" style="s2">that we also share how to be thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.569" end="00:54:43.930" style="s2">about the interpretation and use of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.769" end="00:54:48.999" style="s2">those insights but I&#39;m sure that there</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.930" end="00:54:51.160" style="s2">are people who have studied the history</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.999" end="00:54:53.380" style="s2">and evolution and tools and technologies</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.160" end="00:54:55.029" style="s2">of propaganda and narrative warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.380" end="00:54:56.680" style="s2">information warfare much much better</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.029" end="00:55:00.519" style="s2">than I have I would be super interested</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.680" end="00:55:02.920" style="s2">in having those people on and same with</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.519" end="00:55:04.269" style="s2">like psychiatric diagnosis and various</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.920" end="00:55:05.769" style="s2">lines of it I&#39;m sure there are more</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.269" end="00:55:07.269" style="s2">nuanced thinkers so I&#39;m going to share</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.769" end="00:55:09.219" style="s2">the way that I think about it and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.269" end="00:55:11.519" style="s2">would be surprised if in five years I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.219" end="00:55:14.440" style="s2">still think the same way about it and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.519" end="00:55:16.959" style="s2">that&#39;s important because I like this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.440" end="00:55:21.039" style="s2">my best current thinking in an area that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.959" end="00:55:23.049" style="s2">I know a little bit about so I would ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.039" end="00:55:24.759" style="s2">that people take it as a stimulus for</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.049" end="00:55:29.589" style="s2">your own thinking including where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.759" end="00:55:31.869" style="s2">disagree rather than as a am i right or</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.589" end="00:55:33.309" style="s2">not right and if I not right throw it</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.869" end="00:55:35.619" style="s2">out and don&#39;t even have stimulated</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.309" end="00:55:37.809" style="s2">thinking and if right then also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.619" end="00:55:39.579" style="s2">have stimulated thinking the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.809" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">treat someone as an authority and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.579" end="00:55:43.630" style="s2">either accept what they say and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:44.829" style="s2">think or reject what they say and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.630" end="00:55:47.829" style="s2">think like both of those are so</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.829" end="00:55:50.709" style="s2">uninteresting so my hope is that this</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.829" end="00:55:52.630" style="s2">video if it does anything stimulate your</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.709" end="00:55:54.099" style="s2">own deeper thinking and own exploration</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.630" end="00:56:04.390" style="s2">and study and learning and conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.099" end="00:56:06.130" style="s2">on these topics okay so and and if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.390" end="00:56:10.059" style="s2">disagree with me about something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.130" end="00:56:12.880" style="s2">super interested to know because like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.059" end="00:56:15.910" style="s2">said I&#39;m sure that conversations where</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.880" end="00:56:17.829" style="s2">people disagree is and I and in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.910" end="00:56:18.999" style="s2">places their right is why in five years</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.829" end="00:56:20.499" style="s2">I will think differently on these things</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.999" end="00:56:21.519" style="s2">than I do now just like I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.499" end="00:56:22.930" style="s2">different there are lots of things now</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.519" end="00:56:24.249" style="s2">they did five years ago so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.930" end="00:56:27.519" style="s2">places where my thoughts have updated</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.249" end="00:56:29.490" style="s2">was when I studied the literature on</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.519" end="00:56:33.520" style="s2">cluster be dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.490" end="00:56:35.800" style="s2">it really both helped and bothered me</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.520" end="00:56:38.829" style="s2">Plus to be 9mx mean meaning the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.800" end="00:56:39.700" style="s2">dot often called the dark triad yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.829" end="00:56:42.849" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.700" end="00:56:44.530" style="s2">and so I&#39;ll specifically say the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.849" end="00:56:46.540" style="s2">we call antisocial personality disorder</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.530" end="00:56:49.240" style="s2">the sociopathy psychopathy and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.540" end="00:57:02.310" style="s2">narcissism I&#39;ll particularly focus on</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.240" end="00:57:06.670" style="s2">those ones I had always previously taken</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.310" end="00:57:10.660" style="s2">people who behaved in those ways through</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.670" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">a before I had studied that literature I</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.660" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">took those behaviors as like from an</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:18.790" style="s2">attachment theoretic perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:19.569" style="s2">they had you know some kind of avoidant</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.790" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">attachment where they had been</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.569" end="00:57:24.900" style="s2">traumatized so they couldn&#39;t trust well</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:26.980" style="s2">or you know something like that or they</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.900" end="00:57:28.510" style="s2">they were traumatized in the traumas</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.980" end="00:57:30.700" style="s2">perpetuating itself in some way but I</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.510" end="00:57:33.960" style="s2">took it that way where then my goal was</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.700" end="00:57:35.829" style="s2">to help heal the trauma and be</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.960" end="00:57:38.530" style="s2">redemptive right to be compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.829" end="00:57:41.740" style="s2">redemptive and I have a and I think lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.530" end="00:57:43.150" style="s2">of people have a very deep don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.740" end="00:57:47.260" style="s2">just villainize throw people away</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.150" end="00:57:48.730" style="s2">punished but recognize that insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.260" end="00:57:50.319" style="s2">people are hurting people it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.730" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">because they were hurt and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.319" end="00:57:54.190" style="s2">not just a punitive answer right and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:56.319" style="s2">know that the just punitive answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.190" end="00:57:57.609" style="s2">itself leads to escalating warfare that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.319" end="00:58:00.040" style="s2">leads to a world that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.609" end="00:58:02.290" style="s2">we can&#39;t keep handling group punitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.040" end="00:58:04.450" style="s2">dynamics which is war with escalating</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.290" end="00:58:06.490" style="s2">texts so but I was very oriented in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.450" end="00:58:09.400" style="s2">way and I noticed that there were lots</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.490" end="00:58:11.050" style="s2">of people who had addictions and lied</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.400" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">and did violent things that I spent time</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.050" end="00:58:15.400" style="s2">with and they really changed like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:17.890" style="s2">someone helping them have new</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.400" end="00:58:20.800" style="s2">experiences really change him awesome I</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.890" end="00:58:24.430" style="s2">also noticed some people didn&#39;t which I</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.800" end="00:58:27.730" style="s2">always took as a failing of my capacity</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.430" end="00:58:29.140" style="s2">to be more effective with them and as I</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.730" end="00:58:32.339" style="s2">started to say the literature I saw that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.140" end="00:58:34.630" style="s2">where the failings had occurred and</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.339" end="00:58:37.420" style="s2">corresponding with the places where I</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.630" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">had the most regrets in my life which</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.420" end="00:58:41.619" style="s2">usually involved giving the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:42.800" style="s2">the doubt so I trusted someone were</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.619" end="00:58:43.970" style="s2">actually felt that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.800" end="00:58:45.740" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t I kind of knew that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.970" end="00:58:47.270" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t but I talked myself into it</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.740" end="00:58:49.670" style="s2">out of give the benefit of the doubt and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.270" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">be redemptive which means I gas lit</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.670" end="00:58:55.400" style="s2">myself right when we Gaslight other</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:57.080" style="s2">people what that means usually is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.400" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">we share some kind of rationally</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.080" end="00:59:02.080" style="s2">compelling arguments that has them</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:04.340" style="s2">override their own intuitive sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.080" end="00:59:06.470" style="s2">sometimes we will use our virtues to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.340" end="00:59:07.670" style="s2">Gaslight ourselves and this is again</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.470" end="00:59:09.620" style="s2">where we have to be careful because is</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.670" end="00:59:11.540" style="s2">it that I have a real intuitive knowing</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.620" end="00:59:13.610" style="s2">and I&#39;m gaslighting myself in it with an</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.540" end="00:59:15.950" style="s2">inappropriately applied generalization</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.610" end="00:59:18.470" style="s2">or is it that the thing I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.950" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">intuition is actually bias and Prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.470" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">and using logic to help clear it as the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.920" style="s2">right thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:26.990" style="s2">this is tricky and I can share</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.920" end="00:59:29.450" style="s2">no absolute rule other than no both of</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.990" end="00:59:32.600" style="s2">those things can be the case and really</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.450" end="00:59:33.800" style="s2">be thoughtful about it and create</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.600" end="00:59:35.420" style="s2">friendships with people that you also</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.800" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">think are very thoughtful and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.420" end="00:59:39.590" style="s2">wise and explore the topics with them</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:41.720" style="s2">and like I don&#39;t have an algorithm and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.590" end="00:59:43.370" style="s2">don&#39;t believe there is one I believe one</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.720" end="00:59:45.650" style="s2">can simply understand the different</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.370" end="00:59:46.130" style="s2">types of failure case and be attentive</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.650" end="00:59:50.030" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.130" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">I think the attempt to reduce it to an</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.030" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">algorithm will always be damaging so I</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:08.110" style="s2">noticed that there were places where I I</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:11.420" style="s2">gasp let myself in overrode my own sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.110" end="01:00:13.670" style="s2">that someone was not trustworthy because</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.420" end="01:00:15.230" style="s2">I wanted to offer trust to them in a way</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.670" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">that would help them be able to trust</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.230" end="01:00:18.020" style="s2">because obviously offering trust in good</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:19.910" style="s2">faith can help other people be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.020" end="01:00:22.070" style="s2">trust but of course if I trust someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.910" end="01:00:23.540" style="s2">and as a result invite them into my life</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.070" end="01:00:26.860" style="s2">or circles or whatever in certain ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.540" end="01:00:30.410" style="s2">where then other people that trust me</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.860" end="01:00:34.640" style="s2">now can be hurt by those people then I</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.410" end="01:00:37.010" style="s2">actually became untrustworthy myself to</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.640" end="01:00:39.350" style="s2">the other people through my own poor</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.010" end="01:00:40.850" style="s2">discernment or poor boundaries and those</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.350" end="01:00:42.530" style="s2">were the places where I usually had the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.850" end="01:00:44.450" style="s2">deepest regrets from like man I actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.530" end="01:00:46.610" style="s2">did something that led to other people</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.450" end="01:00:48.260" style="s2">getting hurt or me not upholding</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.610" end="01:00:51.020" style="s2">boundaries that I should have and it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.260" end="01:00:53.570" style="s2">it was actually out of my own desire to</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.020" end="01:00:55.210" style="s2">be redemptive and have good faith where</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.570" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">it was inappropriate</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.210" end="01:01:00.490" style="s2">and so when I start understand the NPD</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.839" end="01:01:03.490" style="s2">sociopathy I started saying oh there are</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.490" end="01:01:05.829" style="s2">certain people where whom I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.490" end="01:01:07.569" style="s2">to say healing isn&#39;t possible a</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.829" end="01:01:10.059" style="s2">redemption isn&#39;t possible but it is of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.569" end="01:01:12.550" style="s2">different type what what it would take</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.059" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">to heal it like that the pathology is of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.550" end="01:01:17.650" style="s2">a different type it has created some</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:20.140" style="s2">very powerful self reinforcing loop that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.650" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">eats most types of therapy without</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.140" end="01:01:23.619" style="s2">actually addressing the loop and simply</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.240" end="01:01:27.460" style="s2">uses them to get better at doing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.619" end="01:01:30.130" style="s2">thing and so you either need to not</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.460" end="01:01:31.510" style="s2">engage or engage of some type that could</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.130" end="01:01:33.309" style="s2">be effective which I would say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.510" end="01:01:39.130" style="s2">see anyone who is generally good at that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.309" end="01:01:40.420" style="s2">currently so then there are some times</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.130" end="01:01:41.319" style="s2">where rather than being redemptive the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.420" end="01:01:44.020" style="s2">higher value is actually being</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.319" end="01:01:48.010" style="s2">protective which is again still not</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.020" end="01:01:50.349" style="s2">punitive right and it doesn&#39;t close the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.010" end="01:01:52.390" style="s2">door on ever redemptive but it certainly</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.349" end="01:01:54.010" style="s2">says I&#39;m not going to try and do it and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.390" end="01:01:55.540" style="s2">fail where I&#39;m actually not equipped to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.010" end="01:01:59.400" style="s2">do it because of certain things that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.540" end="01:02:02.049" style="s2">notice so yes if there is someone who is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.400" end="01:02:04.180" style="s2">oriented to power in a way that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.049" end="01:02:05.799" style="s2">has some defended blind spots where they</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.180" end="01:02:07.240" style="s2">don&#39;t even see that they are or they</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.799" end="01:02:08.530" style="s2">don&#39;t hold it that way or they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.240" end="01:02:10.900" style="s2">hold that there&#39;s a problem with it or</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.530" end="01:02:12.760" style="s2">whatever and I show them hey the reason</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.900" end="01:02:15.160" style="s2">I don&#39;t trust you is these three things</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.760" end="01:02:17.049" style="s2">then what they know is oh I will make</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.160" end="01:02:22.119" style="s2">sure around him to never demonstrate</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.049" end="01:02:24.790" style="s2">those three things again and now they</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.119" end="01:02:28.599" style="s2">have gotten better right at being able</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.790" end="01:02:31.089" style="s2">to be covert in that process so we do</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.599" end="01:02:32.619" style="s2">have to be careful about hey when I</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.089" end="01:02:34.990" style="s2">offer feedback is this going to help</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.619" end="01:02:37.270" style="s2">someone actually heal because they have</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.990" end="01:02:40.030" style="s2">the earnest willingness and desire and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.270" end="01:02:44.200" style="s2">capacity to heal or is this going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.030" end="01:02:47.230" style="s2">help weaponize their orientation now I</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.200" end="01:02:48.520" style="s2">have also seen obviously there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.230" end="01:02:51.609" style="s2">certain circles that don&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.520" end="01:02:53.440" style="s2">healing and in psychotherapy very much</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.609" end="01:02:56.049" style="s2">they might talk about religion or</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.440" end="01:02:58.630" style="s2">tradition or just science or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.049" end="01:03:00.280" style="s2">then they&#39;re in the circles that talk</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.630" end="01:03:04.180" style="s2">more about things like healing and</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.280" end="01:03:06.280" style="s2">healing trauma I don&#39;t know any places</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.180" end="01:03:08.230" style="s2">that attract narcissism sociopaths</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.280" end="01:03:10.540" style="s2">better because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.230" end="01:03:11.770" style="s2">vulnerable people</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.540" end="01:03:15.430" style="s2">that would be good sources of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.770" end="01:03:18.420" style="s2">narcissistic supply and who are willing</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.430" end="01:03:21.369" style="s2">to hear like that&#39;s just your ego</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.420" end="01:03:24.070" style="s2">or me doing this as me just being</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.369" end="01:03:25.960" style="s2">authentic or being vulnerable or</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.070" end="01:03:30.670" style="s2">expressing my emotions or whatever else</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.960" end="01:03:32.140" style="s2">that basically allows bad behavior under</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.670" end="01:03:34.420" style="s2">the name of some therapeutic or</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.140" end="01:03:37.750" style="s2">spiritual idea and this is why we see so</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.420" end="01:03:39.550" style="s2">many spiritual teachers that we then see</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.750" end="01:03:40.560" style="s2">later we&#39;re being sexually or</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.550" end="01:03:44.109" style="s2">financially or emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.560" end="01:03:46.390" style="s2">psychologically abusive with people and</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.109" end="01:03:49.810" style="s2">in the therapeutic space because</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.390" end="01:03:53.550" style="s2">basically insofar as they&#39;re oriented to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.810" end="01:03:56.140" style="s2">weaponize relationship and mind control</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.550" end="01:03:57.609" style="s2">the domains of mind control in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.140" end="01:03:59.230" style="s2">domains where there is legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.609" end="01:04:00.760" style="s2">Authority like a priest or a therapist</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.230" end="01:04:02.950" style="s2">or whatever where people are offering</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.760" end="01:04:05.020" style="s2">some degree of trust and vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.950" end="01:04:07.510" style="s2">to legitimate Authority there are no</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.020" end="01:04:09.310" style="s2">more powerful positions to be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.510" end="01:04:11.080" style="s2">that thing now of course also economics</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.310" end="01:04:12.369" style="s2">politics military you know those other</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.080" end="01:04:17.700" style="s2">things but these are particularly</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.369" end="01:04:17.700" style="s2">sensitive in susceptible areas and so I</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.970" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">have seen I&#39;ll give some examples of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.090" end="01:04:26.950" style="s2">weaponization of psychological tools</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:29.590" style="s2">especially that show up in what we might</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.950" end="01:04:33.490" style="s2">call progressive new-age whatever kinds</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.590" end="01:04:34.750" style="s2">of circles that there are versions of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.490" end="01:04:36.369" style="s2">this that are slightly different that</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.750" end="01:04:38.260" style="s2">showed up in the Catholic Dark Age or</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.369" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">the whatever right like what what is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.260" end="01:04:41.560" style="s2">way that the the virtues the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:43.570" style="s2">psychological tools spiritual insights</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.560" end="01:04:45.310" style="s2">get weaponized for power games but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.570" end="01:04:47.590" style="s2">share that these ones here because these</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.310" end="01:04:48.940" style="s2">you know because rebel wisdom hosts</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.590" end="01:04:50.680" style="s2">circling because people here are</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.940" end="01:04:54.119" style="s2">interested in psychological development</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.680" end="01:04:54.119" style="s2">so we need to be aware of these</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.900" end="01:05:01.789" style="s2">people can use the virtue or the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.719" end="01:05:06.170" style="s2">statement of the virtue of transparency</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.789" end="01:05:07.789" style="s2">to just be assholes and it&#39;s a weapon I</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.170" end="01:05:09.410" style="s2">it&#39;s a weaponization of the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.789" end="01:05:13.099" style="s2">transparency I remember the first time I</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.410" end="01:05:15.079" style="s2">saw this like which some it was like</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.099" end="01:05:17.569" style="s2">shocking and disgusting to me I saw this</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.079" end="01:05:19.759" style="s2">married couple that was there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.569" end="01:05:24.049" style="s2">many years ago that was doing this like</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.759" end="01:05:26.029" style="s2">radical honesty group and he was saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.049" end="01:05:28.309" style="s2">things to her like your face looks</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.029" end="01:05:31.700" style="s2">really ugly today and she was saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.309" end="01:05:32.479" style="s2">things to him like I feel hatred arising</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.700" end="01:05:37.309" style="s2">and I want to throw you out the window</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.479" end="01:05:38.869" style="s2">and I was like and then they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.309" end="01:05:42.130" style="s2">we&#39;re just being radically honest and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.869" end="01:05:45.140" style="s2">transparent and that&#39;s a virtue I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.130" end="01:05:47.390" style="s2">no it&#39;s not like this is actually not a</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.140" end="01:05:49.130" style="s2">virtue this is you taking the lowest</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.390" end="01:05:53.390" style="s2">parts of your nature and amplifying the</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.130" end="01:05:54.950" style="s2"> out of them and in ways that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.390" end="01:05:58.339" style="s2">actually serve anything other than</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.950" end="01:06:00.680" style="s2">cruelty and so it&#39;s very easy to see</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.339" end="01:06:04.009" style="s2">like that&#39;s not a healthy example of of</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.680" end="01:06:06.380" style="s2">transparency so then on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.009" end="01:06:08.930" style="s2">people can weaponize kindness or I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.380" end="01:06:11.239" style="s2">say miss apply it but it can also be</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.930" end="01:06:13.180" style="s2">weaponized right which is no no we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.239" end="01:06:16.009" style="s2">want to say things that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.180" end="01:06:18.109" style="s2">unnecessarily hurtful so then the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.009" end="01:06:20.119" style="s2">overcompensation and that side can be</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.109" end="01:06:21.079" style="s2">well I&#39;m not gonna tell them those</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.119" end="01:06:23.859" style="s2">things because it would hurt their</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.079" end="01:06:27.559" style="s2">feelings which is actually now a</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.859" end="01:06:31.670" style="s2">rationalization for lying or lying</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.559" end="01:06:33.349" style="s2">through a mission which then like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.670" end="01:06:34.609" style="s2">other person doesn&#39;t have consent and is</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.349" end="01:06:39.739" style="s2">that information being withheld from</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.609" end="01:06:41.239" style="s2">them and so there is a dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.739" end="01:06:43.549" style="s2">relationship between something like</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.239" end="01:06:45.259" style="s2">honesty or transparency on one side and</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.549" end="01:06:47.539" style="s2">kindness and thoughtfulness on the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.259" end="01:06:49.999" style="s2">side that are both relevant and neither</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.539" end="01:06:52.219" style="s2">are the absolute virtue that trumps the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.999" end="01:06:54.859" style="s2">set of things that all need considered</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.219" end="01:06:57.229" style="s2">to show up well right so this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.859" end="01:06:59.839" style="s2">important and I will specifically see</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.229" end="01:07:01.069" style="s2">that some people just being dumb and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.839" end="01:07:02.809" style="s2">believing a teacher will do this</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.069" end="01:07:04.549" style="s2">nonsense right but nobody&#39;s particular</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.809" end="01:07:06.859" style="s2">narcissist but narcissists who want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.549" end="01:07:07.730" style="s2">kind of say mean things to people well</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.859" end="01:07:09.109" style="s2">then after</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.730" end="01:07:10.940" style="s2">words and people are all upset say</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.109" end="01:07:12.380" style="s2">you&#39;re shaming me for my honesty and</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.940" end="01:07:14.570" style="s2">transparency you&#39;re trying to get me to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.380" end="01:07:16.010" style="s2">emotionally repress this you&#39;re the part</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.570" end="01:07:17.720" style="s2">of the patriarchy again that is trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.010" end="01:07:19.010" style="s2">to shut down emotions this is just about</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.720" end="01:07:26.510" style="s2">honestly embracing and accepting</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.010" end="01:07:29.480" style="s2">emotionality right hogwash I am</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.510" end="01:07:31.790" style="s2">responsible for my emotions and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.480" end="01:07:32.930" style="s2">want to suppress them where they&#39;ll blow</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.790" end="01:07:35.330" style="s2">up and I also don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.930" end="01:07:37.369" style="s2">unconsciously act on the lowest parts of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.330" end="01:07:39.590" style="s2">n triggered and wounded parts of my</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.369" end="01:07:41.390" style="s2">nature I want to notice them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.590" end="01:07:44.780" style="s2">responsibly do what it takes to heal</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.390" end="01:07:47.060" style="s2">them without perpetuating harm and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.780" end="01:07:48.710" style="s2">don&#39;t want to perpetuate harm and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.060" end="01:07:50.150" style="s2">pretend that I didn&#39;t and say no no</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.710" end="01:07:51.920" style="s2">you&#39;re responsible for the meaning you</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.150" end="01:07:55.700" style="s2">made this is another classic example</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.920" end="01:07:58.670" style="s2">right which is a first person or a</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.700" end="01:08:02.180" style="s2">second person emphasis and in relational</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.670" end="01:08:04.070" style="s2">dynamics you can&#39;t hurt me because</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.180" end="01:08:05.990" style="s2">whatever you say is just you saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.070" end="01:08:07.460" style="s2">things it&#39;s the meaning that I make of</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.990" end="01:08:10.010" style="s2">it that hurts me well that&#39;s partially</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.460" end="01:08:11.810" style="s2">true and it&#39;s empowering to me to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.010" end="01:08:13.100" style="s2">degree that I hold it because even if</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.810" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">you&#39;re an asshole I don&#39;t have to get</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.100" end="01:08:18.020" style="s2">really bent out of shape about it but</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:19.880" style="s2">the moment I tried to tell someone else</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.020" end="01:08:21.589" style="s2">that the only reason they feel hurt by</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.880" end="01:08:24.470" style="s2">me is the meaning they&#39;re making up on</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.589" end="01:08:27.080" style="s2">it this is again like rule Omega can be</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.470" end="01:08:28.790" style="s2">offered not invoked I can take</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.080" end="01:08:30.200" style="s2">responsibility for not having my</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.790" end="01:08:32.359" style="s2">feelings hurt by what someone else says</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.200" end="01:08:35.180" style="s2">but I can&#39;t tell someone else they need</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.359" end="01:08:38.120" style="s2">to take responsibility for it therefore</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.180" end="01:08:41.150" style="s2">I can be an asshole right now this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.120" end="01:08:42.500" style="s2">again tricky as because we can see</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.150" end="01:08:44.060" style="s2">where people will do that they will just</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.500" end="01:08:45.109" style="s2">be an asshole and then say I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.060" end="01:08:48.100" style="s2">an asshole I&#39;m just being me</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.109" end="01:08:57.140" style="s2">authentically and you&#39;re choosing to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.100" end="01:09:03.049" style="s2">unsolved in but then on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.140" end="01:09:06.200" style="s2">of that where is it important to</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.049" end="01:09:08.180" style="s2">actually help other people take more</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.200" end="01:09:09.859" style="s2">sovereign responsibility and say look</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.180" end="01:09:11.359" style="s2">I&#39;m actually not being an asshole I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.859" end="01:09:12.739" style="s2">not being unlawful and considered I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:17.120" style="s2">saying something that is really true and</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.739" end="01:09:19.219" style="s2">important and consider it and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.120" end="01:09:21.389" style="s2">reactivity that you hold about it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.219" end="01:09:25.949" style="s2">actually taking you out of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.389" end="01:09:29.069" style="s2">right so again it&#39;s easy to air on</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.949" end="01:09:31.880" style="s2">either side of this so if someone gets</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.069" end="01:09:36.029" style="s2">their feelings hurt am I responsible</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.880" end="01:09:38.009" style="s2">kind of sometimes yes sometimes no to</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.029" end="01:09:40.139" style="s2">some degree as to some degree no right</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.009" end="01:09:46.770" style="s2">and how do we tell the difference that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.139" end="01:09:48.690" style="s2">the key question the moment I offer a</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.770" end="01:09:54.210" style="s2">algorithm for that that will become the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.690" end="01:09:56.730" style="s2">new weapon and so what I can say is you</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.210" end="01:09:59.010" style="s2">can endeavor earnestly as best you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.730" end="01:10:01.440" style="s2">to notice where you&#39;re actually coming</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.010" end="01:10:02.790" style="s2">from and the effects of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.440" end="01:10:03.869" style="s2">doing and where others are actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.790" end="01:10:06.270" style="s2">coming from and the effects they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.869" end="01:10:08.280" style="s2">doing and also listen to other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.270" end="01:10:10.590" style="s2">perspective on the way you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.280" end="01:10:13.230" style="s2">and I don&#39;t have a better answer than</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.590" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">that so there are certain things that</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.230" end="01:10:16.619" style="s2">seem obviously in bad faith there are a</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:18.030" style="s2">lot of other things that clearly the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.619" end="01:10:19.619" style="s2">other person doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s in bad</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.030" end="01:10:20.610" style="s2">faith but they&#39;re making a mistake there</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.619" end="01:10:21.810" style="s2">are other things that might seem like</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.610" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">they&#39;re in bad faith but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.810" end="01:10:24.360" style="s2">because the person saying something that</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:25.590" style="s2">pisses me off but they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.360" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">showing up in good faith and I just</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.590" end="01:10:35.550" style="s2">don&#39;t want to hear it and so like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:40.500" style="s2">a protocol that I hold in relationships</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.550" end="01:10:43.530" style="s2">for communication when I&#39;m communicating</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.500" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">with someone I endeavor to and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.530" end="01:10:47.460" style="s2">definitely do not always succeed at this</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:49.560" style="s2">but I endeavor as best I can to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.460" end="01:10:51.929" style="s2">communicate when I&#39;m speaking in a way</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.560" end="01:10:54.119" style="s2">that they will actually hear what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.929" end="01:10:56.730" style="s2">intending to share regardless of what</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.119" end="01:10:58.260" style="s2">their filters of hearing are which means</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.730" end="01:10:59.790" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try to empathetically put</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.260" end="01:11:01.949" style="s2">myself in their shoes enough that I can</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.790" end="01:11:03.360" style="s2">customize how I communicate where</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.949" end="01:11:04.699" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to hear it not just say</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.360" end="01:11:07.110" style="s2"> the way that makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.699" end="01:11:08.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t hear that here cuz I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.110" end="01:11:09.449" style="s2">to a huge number of people and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.280" end="01:11:10.260" style="s2">know how to do that for a huge number of</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.449" end="01:11:12.330" style="s2">people but when I&#39;m talking with</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.260" end="01:11:14.489" style="s2">somebody one on one that&#39;s my goal</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.330" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">not as a manipulation but as a meeting</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.489" end="01:11:18.840" style="s2">someone where they are and saying my</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:20.730" style="s2">goal is not to talk at someone and just</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.840" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2"> throw words at them like bullets</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.730" end="01:11:24.179" style="s2">right my goal is to actually communicate</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:25.260" style="s2">in a way where they hear what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.179" end="01:11:27.090" style="s2">and I hear what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.260" end="01:11:31.110" style="s2">communicate is to find some communion</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.090" end="01:11:32.250" style="s2">right and so if I&#39;m talking at them and</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.110" end="01:11:33.630" style="s2">they&#39;re not hearing what I&#39;m saying I</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.250" end="01:11:35.159" style="s2">want to take responsibility to say okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.630" end="01:11:36.750" style="s2">well even if their react</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.159" end="01:11:40.050" style="s2">and they&#39;re going into unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.750" end="01:11:41.520" style="s2">reactions even if they seem to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.050" end="01:11:42.900" style="s2">cotton balls in their ears that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.520" end="01:11:45.239" style="s2"> up the way they&#39;re hearing stuff</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.900" end="01:11:47.639" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to communicate with them</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.239" end="01:11:50.040" style="s2">but if I am choosing to communicate with</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.639" end="01:11:52.409" style="s2">them and to try to find some commonality</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.040" end="01:11:53.909" style="s2">or some communion how do I check that my</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.409" end="01:11:56.280" style="s2">communication is landing and how do I</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.909" end="01:11:57.750" style="s2">use the frames the words the metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.280" end="01:11:59.370" style="s2">that might be able to make sense to them</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.750" end="01:12:02.460" style="s2">as opposed to just say it&#39;s your fault</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.370" end="01:12:04.650" style="s2">that you&#39;re listening badly on the other</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.460" end="01:12:07.290" style="s2">side when someone is talking to me as</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.650" end="01:12:08.610" style="s2">best I can I try to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.290" end="01:12:10.190" style="s2">to hear where they&#39;re coming from even</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.610" end="01:12:12.750" style="s2">if I think they&#39;re communicating poorly</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.190" end="01:12:14.280" style="s2">right so maybe they&#39;re really angry and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.750" end="01:12:16.050" style="s2">they&#39;re clearly exaggerating you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.280" end="01:12:17.670" style="s2">never blah blah blah blah blah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.050" end="01:12:19.139" style="s2">not true they never blow a lot but that</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.670" end="01:12:21.719" style="s2">like they&#39;re angry they&#39;re exaggerating</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.139" end="01:12:24.480" style="s2">but I&#39;m trying to listen to is there</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.719" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">some true thing here rather than got</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:29.429" style="s2">caught up on what is false is there some</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:33.719" style="s2">actual need that isn&#39;t met that I can</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.429" end="01:12:35.610" style="s2">hear is there and because that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.719" end="01:12:38.460" style="s2">either side of the communication that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.610" end="01:12:40.170" style="s2">me taking the responsibility to try to</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.460" end="01:12:43.290" style="s2">have effective communication come as</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.170" end="01:12:45.540" style="s2">much as I can now I also want to try and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.290" end="01:12:47.429" style="s2">support them to do that but I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.540" end="01:12:48.510" style="s2">force it I can only support it and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.429" end="01:12:50.040" style="s2">I have to pay attention to what is</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.510" end="01:12:52.889" style="s2">effective and actually supporting it and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.040" end="01:12:56.610" style="s2">then I also ultimately decide whether or</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.889" end="01:12:59.489" style="s2">not I keep relating with them there</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.610" end="01:13:02.040" style="s2">there&#39;s so much nuance here and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.489" end="01:13:05.659" style="s2">again it&#39;s very easy for people to</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.040" end="01:13:09.690" style="s2">weaponize the idea of nuance generally</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.659" end="01:13:11.820" style="s2">the answer is that it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.690" end="01:13:14.520" style="s2">have a partial truth that polarizes that</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.820" end="01:13:16.949" style="s2">isn&#39;t held with other partial truths</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.520" end="01:13:18.659" style="s2">that polarize or like a fact right like</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.949" end="01:13:20.100" style="s2">the the facts we gave as examples</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.659" end="01:13:22.830" style="s2">earlier where I&#39;m cherry-picking out of</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.100" end="01:13:25.770" style="s2">datasets that is true but not</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.830" end="01:13:28.050" style="s2">representative and so then usually the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.770" end="01:13:30.659" style="s2">answer is include more stuff which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.050" end="01:13:33.420" style="s2">more nuanced more complex but then I</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.659" end="01:13:36.330" style="s2">have seen people weaponize the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.420" end="01:13:38.370" style="s2">nuance when someone is actually stating</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.330" end="01:13:40.110" style="s2">something that is simple and actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.370" end="01:13:41.310" style="s2">has truth and clarity and simplicity and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.110" end="01:13:44.310" style="s2">the other person doesn&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.310" end="01:13:48.180" style="s2">boundary to exist then they say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.310" end="01:13:50.380" style="s2">not being nuanced enough right and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.180" end="01:13:53.490" style="s2">this is why it&#39;s like the Dow that his</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.380" end="01:13:56.560" style="s2">name was not the eternal Dow the virtue</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.490" end="01:14:00.220" style="s2">that you say is the one that trumps all</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.560" end="01:14:05.860" style="s2">of the other ones the the protocol that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.220" end="01:14:08.080" style="s2">is the protocol it doesn&#39;t exist and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.860" end="01:14:08.800" style="s2">know if I want to try and talk about</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.080" end="01:14:12.730" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.800" end="01:14:16.060" style="s2">I usually don&#39;t think of integrity as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.730" end="01:14:18.160" style="s2">virtue or a value as much as I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.060" end="01:14:20.500" style="s2">that it about it as the degree of</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.160" end="01:14:25.480" style="s2">congruence between my behavior and all</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.500" end="01:14:27.390" style="s2">of my other virtues or values and so if</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.480" end="01:14:33.070" style="s2">I value kindness and I also value</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.390" end="01:14:36.730" style="s2">transparency and I value truth and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.070" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">also value connection and I then how</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.730" end="01:14:41.530" style="s2">well am I able to navigate high</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:42.730" style="s2">correlation between the way I&#39;m showing</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.530" end="01:14:45.900" style="s2">up and all of those values</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.730" end="01:14:50.250" style="s2">simultaneously is kind of my integrity</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.900" end="01:14:52.570" style="s2">assessment we were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.250" end="01:14:54.100" style="s2">weaponizing certain psychological things</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.570" end="01:14:56.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s some more examples that are</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.100" end="01:14:57.970" style="s2">important so we talked about weaponizing</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.560" end="01:15:01.750" style="s2">transparency then we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.970" end="01:15:03.730" style="s2">weaponizing kindness I have seen so</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.750" end="01:15:07.420" style="s2">people can weaponize their own</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.730" end="01:15:09.400" style="s2">vulnerability where it&#39;s like I watched</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.420" end="01:15:12.280" style="s2">after brené Brown came out and did her</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.400" end="01:15:14.770" style="s2">stuff on vulnerability that then I saw</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.280" end="01:15:17.170" style="s2">all these things on Facebook of life</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.770" end="01:15:18.220" style="s2">coaches crying in the camera with tears</p>

<p begin="01:15:18.220" end="01:15:22.780" style="s2">they are and you know then if you want</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.370" end="01:15:25.630" style="s2">to learn how to be vulnerable to their</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.780" end="01:15:27.790" style="s2">packages for sale and like oh</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.630" end="01:15:31.120" style="s2">like that that&#39;s like weaponizing via</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.790" end="01:15:32.830" style="s2">virtue signaling where the more</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.120" end="01:15:34.660" style="s2">vulnerable thing if they were being</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.830" end="01:15:35.800" style="s2">really vulnerable wouldn&#39;t be them</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.660" end="01:15:37.270" style="s2">crying about this thing that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.800" end="01:15:39.430" style="s2">already resolved and is really not</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.270" end="01:15:41.320" style="s2">actually consequential to them which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.430" end="01:15:43.480" style="s2">not real vulnerability it would be them</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.320" end="01:15:45.610" style="s2">saying I&#39;m broke right now guys and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.480" end="01:15:48.490" style="s2">need to pay the bills and I really want</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.610" end="01:15:51.220" style="s2">you to buy my package and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.490" end="01:15:52.660" style="s2">it&#39;s beneficial for some people and like</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.220" end="01:15:53.800" style="s2">that would be awesome actual</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.660" end="01:15:58.810" style="s2">authenticity and vulnerability which</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.800" end="01:16:01.349" style="s2">very rarely happens I have seen like one</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.810" end="01:16:06.480" style="s2">of the worst ones is weaponizing apology</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.349" end="01:16:13.710" style="s2">and and remorse so again associated with</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.480" end="01:16:16.949" style="s2">something like narcissism generally if</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.710" end="01:16:18.750" style="s2">the person feels that the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.949" end="01:16:21.719" style="s2">challenging them or upset with them</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.750" end="01:16:24.659" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have power and they do they will</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.719" end="01:16:27.449" style="s2">just say this is your ego making up</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.659" end="01:16:29.550" style="s2">nonsense and they&#39;ll Gaslight them but</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.449" end="01:16:31.860" style="s2">if the other person has power and they</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.550" end="01:16:33.239" style="s2">can&#39;t do that because it&#39;s a whole group</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.860" end="01:16:35.219" style="s2">of people calling them out or it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.239" end="01:16:37.590" style="s2">very someone with a lot of following or</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.219" end="01:16:39.210" style="s2">whatever then the most effective</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.590" end="01:16:42.659" style="s2">game-theoretic thing for them to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.210" end="01:16:44.340" style="s2">might be to start crying and say oh my</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.659" end="01:16:46.650" style="s2">god I&#39;m so sorry this goes back to a</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.340" end="01:16:48.719" style="s2">childhood wound of mine and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.650" end="01:16:50.070" style="s2">vulnerable and I&#39;m working on it and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.719" end="01:16:51.840" style="s2">thought I had healed this pattern and</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.070" end="01:16:54.510" style="s2">still showing up thank you for showing</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.840" end="01:16:57.260" style="s2">it to me I&#39;m really gonna work on it I</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.510" end="01:17:00.150" style="s2">want you guys to hold me accountable and</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.260" end="01:17:01.980" style="s2">I have seen people do this with tears in</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.150" end="01:17:04.050" style="s2">their eyes and a week later do the exact</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.980" end="01:17:05.989" style="s2">same thing when powerful people weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.050" end="01:17:09.960" style="s2">around to hold them accountable and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.989" end="01:17:12.449" style="s2">is basically weaponizing fake remorse</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.960" end="01:17:14.280" style="s2">and apology and whatever so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.449" end="01:17:16.290" style="s2">so if I notice that happen what I know</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.280" end="01:17:18.320" style="s2">is that no words that person says will</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.290" end="01:17:21.060" style="s2">mean anything to me</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.320" end="01:17:22.260" style="s2">so I would need to see if the that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.060" end="01:17:24.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;ve closed off</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.260" end="01:17:27.179" style="s2">redemptive possibilities it means I need</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.300" end="01:17:28.349" style="s2">a different kind of signal so if the</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.179" end="01:17:31.079" style="s2">person said no I&#39;ve really made a change</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.349" end="01:17:32.730" style="s2">I&#39;d be like awesome I&#39;m gonna watch that</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.079" end="01:17:38.040" style="s2">that bad behavior doesn&#39;t happen for</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.730" end="01:17:39.659" style="s2">three or five years and in including</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.040" end="01:17:43.320" style="s2">where you have to actually face</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.659" end="01:17:45.570" style="s2">consequential things right and so again</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.320" end="01:17:47.190" style="s2">the guy beats his wife when he&#39;s drunk</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.570" end="01:17:48.300" style="s2">and then the next day apologize I love</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.190" end="01:17:49.949" style="s2">you I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m never gonna drink</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.300" end="01:17:51.989" style="s2">again and whatever right and the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.949" end="01:17:54.329" style="s2">keeps rinse repeat it&#39;s not an apology</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.989" end="01:17:56.070" style="s2">at the level that will actually change</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.329" end="01:17:59.489" style="s2">the pattern therefore it is a weapon to</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.070" end="01:18:00.540" style="s2">keep her bound to an abuse cycle so when</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.489" end="01:18:04.739" style="s2">is an apology</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.540" end="01:18:07.560" style="s2">or remorse or accountability real well</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.739" end="01:18:10.199" style="s2">it it&#39;s when it is at the level of depth</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.560" end="01:18:13.590" style="s2">that will actually change the behavior</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.199" end="01:18:15.100" style="s2">if it isn&#39;t then whether the person</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.590" end="01:18:21.580" style="s2">thinks they mean it in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.100" end="01:18:23.110" style="s2">not you shouldn&#39;t trust it right so I I</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.580" end="01:18:24.970" style="s2">can obviously give a million examples</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.110" end="01:18:26.980" style="s2">what I&#39;m hoping is I&#39;ve given enough</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.970" end="01:18:30.160" style="s2">examples that you can start finding your</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.980" end="01:18:31.690" style="s2">own examples now does this mean that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.160" end="01:18:34.360" style="s2">anytime someone is crying and</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.690" end="01:18:35.740" style="s2">apologizing that they are weaponizing it</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.360" end="01:18:37.180" style="s2">not earnest now sometimes they might</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.740" end="01:18:39.400" style="s2">really be earnest and they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.180" end="01:18:40.690" style="s2">shift forever or they&#39;re going to start</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.400" end="01:18:43.170" style="s2">a process that will work with a</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.690" end="01:18:45.100" style="s2">difficult you know difficult set of</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.170" end="01:18:47.020" style="s2">dynamics that might involve a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.100" end="01:18:48.550" style="s2">of relapse but earnestly is oriented in</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.020" end="01:18:51.280" style="s2">a different direction versus they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.550" end="01:18:52.930" style="s2">just doing the Mia Copa they need to to</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.280" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">get out of accountability in the moment</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.930" end="01:18:55.570" style="s2">and then go back to power seeking as</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:58.000" style="s2">soon as everyone&#39;s attention is off of</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.570" end="01:18:59.800" style="s2">them which is why three months isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.000" end="01:19:02.200" style="s2">enough right and now can some people</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.800" end="01:19:03.880" style="s2">play a long game sure we have seen some</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.200" end="01:19:06.970" style="s2">great political strategists to play a</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.880" end="01:19:08.980" style="s2">long game so even the principle of wait</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.970" end="01:19:11.640" style="s2">a few years is not a perfect principle</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.980" end="01:19:11.640" style="s2">to rule fun</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.610" end="01:19:21.460" style="s2">another way of thinking about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.650" end="01:19:23.850" style="s2">discussing here is that when people are</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.460" end="01:19:29.230" style="s2">communicating with other people in</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.850" end="01:19:31.080" style="s2">person or via some kind of media what is</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.230" end="01:19:34.180" style="s2">the basis of why they&#39;re communicating</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.080" end="01:19:36.370" style="s2">what is the actual motive or agenda or</p>

<p begin="01:19:36.370" end="01:19:40.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s a it is a shared thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.710" end="01:19:42.040" style="s2">there&#39;s an interpersonal thing happening</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.270" end="01:19:44.290" style="s2">is the communication for the</p>

<p begin="01:20:34.060" end="01:20:39.240" style="s2">this is clear I think there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.650" end="01:20:42.250" style="s2">good bit of debate on theories of it</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.240" end="01:20:43.930" style="s2">Gelman and gerard and you know various</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.250" end="01:20:45.520" style="s2">thinkers on the history of linguistics</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.930" end="01:20:49.690" style="s2">have different thoughts on the evolution</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.520" end="01:20:53.170" style="s2">of spoken language and you know then for</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.690" end="01:20:55.060" style="s2">mobilizations of spoken language but I</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.170" end="01:20:57.340" style="s2">think it&#39;s pretty clear that language</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.060" end="01:21:00.130" style="s2">did not evolve just based on individual</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.340" end="01:21:03.190" style="s2">selection it was that groups survived</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.130" end="01:21:05.110" style="s2">better based on their ability to share</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.190" end="01:21:07.480" style="s2">information and coordinate better I eat</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.110" end="01:21:08.770" style="s2">to share sense making I went and I saw</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.480" end="01:21:10.240" style="s2">where the predator was or where the</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.770" end="01:21:12.160" style="s2">berries were where the water was and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.240" end="01:21:13.600" style="s2">come back and share so the ability for</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.160" end="01:21:15.130" style="s2">the people to share their sense making</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.600" end="01:21:16.780" style="s2">and then to be able to coordinate that</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.130" end="01:21:18.490" style="s2">has a group intelligence that is better</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.780" end="01:21:20.770" style="s2">than just the individual intelligences</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.490" end="01:21:22.420" style="s2">their ability to communicate created</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.770" end="01:21:23.800" style="s2">groups that survive better so than those</p>

<p begin="01:23:08.890" end="01:23:15.070" style="s2">in other places can have Distortion</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.220" end="01:23:16.960" style="s2">intentionally or unintentionally so how</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.070" end="01:23:18.880" style="s2">do you better equip yourself to notice</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.960" end="01:23:20.790" style="s2">that included including the worldviews</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.880" end="01:23:22.570" style="s2">that we&#39;re selling to ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.790" end="01:23:24.820" style="s2">including the worldviews we&#39;re selling</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.570" end="01:23:26.800" style="s2">to ourselves and yeah like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.820" end="01:23:30.160" style="s2">distortion is to self most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.800" end="01:23:31.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually why I said one of</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.160" end="01:23:33.160" style="s2">the things that good sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.390" end="01:23:36.880" style="s2">requires it a lot more courage but also</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.160" end="01:23:41.830" style="s2">a lot more humility because</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.880" end="01:23:45.940" style="s2">one of the main problems is faulty</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.830" end="01:23:48.850" style="s2">overconfidence and then there is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.940" end="01:23:52.780" style="s2">failure on the other side which is to</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.850" end="01:23:54.550" style="s2">simply embrace not confidence but give</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.780" end="01:23:55.810" style="s2">up on sense making I got no idea what</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.550" end="01:23:58.510" style="s2">the fuck&#39;s going on and playing video</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.810" end="01:24:00.040" style="s2">games or I got no idea what&#39;s true so</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.510" end="01:24:01.600" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna vote for a strong man leader</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.040" end="01:24:04.720" style="s2">that I think will at least protect me</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.600" end="01:24:10.600" style="s2">and more right so we can see the number</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.720" end="01:24:12.820" style="s2">of Russian citizens that say that they</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.600" end="01:24:15.250" style="s2">think Putin is lying even to them in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.820" end="01:24:17.050" style="s2">news but also still support him because</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.250" end="01:24:19.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t think that truth is a</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.050" end="01:24:22.090" style="s2">possibility and that a good strong</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.240" end="01:24:23.890" style="s2">politician facing huge opponents and</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.090" end="01:24:26.770" style="s2">enemies like the West has to lie and</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.890" end="01:24:28.360" style="s2">they at least think that he&#39;s gonna keep</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.770" end="01:24:29.530" style="s2">them safe and serve their interests</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.360" end="01:24:31.740" style="s2">better than some other people wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.530" end="01:24:34.930" style="s2">and so you can see there</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.740" end="01:24:36.760" style="s2">when people&#39;s epistemic certainty is low</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.930" end="01:24:38.260" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know how to make good</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.760" end="01:24:40.570" style="s2">choices for themselves or what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.260" end="01:24:43.810" style="s2">they start defecting to wanting strong</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.570" end="01:24:47.350" style="s2">man leaders more we see this in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.810" end="01:24:49.870" style="s2">right now you can also see that because</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.350" end="01:24:51.970" style="s2">strongman leaders know that helping to</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.870" end="01:24:55.240" style="s2">decrease everyone&#39;s epistemic certainty</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.970" end="01:24:57.120" style="s2">is actually in their interest and that</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.240" end="01:25:00.130" style="s2">will always lead in the direction of</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.120" end="01:25:03.520" style="s2">dictatorship towards despotism and if we</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.130" end="01:25:05.260" style="s2">want anything like a more democratic or</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.520" end="01:25:07.180" style="s2">more Republic process where more people</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.260" end="01:25:08.590" style="s2">are engaged in their own governance they</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.180" end="01:25:10.270" style="s2">have to do the sense make them to be</p>

<p begin="01:25:18.610" end="01:25:24.010" style="s2">want to and you don&#39;t commit to do what</p>

<p begin="01:25:24.010" end="01:25:29.530" style="s2">civically engaged then you consent to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.140" end="01:25:32.290" style="s2">ruled by those who seek to rule if you</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.530" end="01:25:34.720" style="s2">are willing to just adopt belief systems</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.290" end="01:25:36.430" style="s2">based on who the dominant group think</p>

<p begin="01:25:36.430" end="01:25:41.800" style="s2">interests as then you are consenting to</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.670" end="01:25:44.230" style="s2">be ruled and to the dissent towards that</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.800" end="01:25:48.160" style="s2">particular kind of dictatorship and if</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.230" end="01:25:50.300" style="s2">you want something like a democratized</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.160" end="01:25:51.860" style="s2">process democracy doesn&#39;t mean voting</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.300" end="01:25:53.690" style="s2">it&#39;s the it means a process by which</p>

<p begin="01:25:53.690" end="01:25:56.810" style="s2">governance of which voting is one tool</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.280" end="01:25:59.270" style="s2">but the founding fathers said voting is</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.810" end="01:26:01.520" style="s2">the death of democracy I forget I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.270" end="01:26:03.140" style="s2">it was Jefferson said it because the</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.520" end="01:26:05.090" style="s2">democracy really meant can more of us</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.140" end="01:26:07.960" style="s2">engage in better conversations than the</p>

<p begin="01:26:10.510" end="01:26:15.050" style="s2">to the degree we have a town hall where</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.590" end="01:26:17.000" style="s2">we have an actual good earnest dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.050" end="01:26:17.930" style="s2">conversation we might not even need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.000" end="01:26:19.850" style="s2">vote because we come up with something</p>

<p begin="01:26:19.850" end="01:26:25.360" style="s2">and the vote is if we can&#39;t to sublimate</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.670" end="01:26:28.070" style="s2">physical warfare with a voting warfare</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.360" end="01:26:29.600" style="s2">right but it&#39;s actually a warfare where</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.070" end="01:26:30.530" style="s2">some people are now actually unhappy</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.600" end="01:26:32.150" style="s2">with the way the whole thing is moving</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.530" end="01:26:34.010" style="s2">forward but they at least think that</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.150" end="01:26:36.170" style="s2">still participating with that system is</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.010" end="01:26:37.820" style="s2">better than defecting on it and going</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.170" end="01:26:39.640" style="s2">into war so they&#39;re willing to do it and</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.820" end="01:26:42.590" style="s2">try again in the next four years right</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.640" end="01:26:44.690" style="s2">or whatever the next thing is but if we</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.590" end="01:26:47.420" style="s2">want something other than despotism it</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.690" end="01:26:49.160" style="s2">the only way to check power actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.420" end="01:26:56.300" style="s2">this is an important point that I would</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.160" end="01:26:58.550" style="s2">like to make them closing anyone who has</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.300" end="01:27:02.000" style="s2">asymmetric power whether that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.550" end="01:27:06.860" style="s2">money or political power or cultural</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.000" end="01:27:08.540" style="s2">influence or whatever and usually those</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.860" end="01:27:10.340" style="s2">come together right more money also</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.540" end="01:27:12.680" style="s2">means that I can buy cultural influence</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.340" end="01:27:14.480" style="s2">through media and marketing and paying</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.680" end="01:27:16.220" style="s2">other people to say things that are</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.480" end="01:27:18.080" style="s2">aligned with what I want and being able</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.220" end="01:27:21.260" style="s2">to pay lobbyists and campaign budgets to</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.080" end="01:27:24.050" style="s2">get political power so we can just talk</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.260" end="01:27:26.960" style="s2">about power itself and all of those as</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.050" end="01:27:29.750" style="s2">expressions those who have more power</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.960" end="01:27:32.300" style="s2">within a power asymmetry both have the</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.750" end="01:27:36.710" style="s2">incentive and the capacity to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.300" end="01:27:39.140" style="s2">that power asymmetry and increase it so</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.710" end="01:27:42.860" style="s2">they have the ability to make news that</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.140" end="01:27:44.870" style="s2">does the bidding of what that has the</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.860" end="01:27:48.710" style="s2">populace believe things that continue to</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.870" end="01:27:51.950" style="s2">serve them having more power in that</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.710" end="01:27:54.110" style="s2">system they can get representation they</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.950" end="01:27:56.510" style="s2">can create technologies they can corner</p>

<p begin="01:27:57.830" end="01:28:03.229" style="s2">continue doing that they can suppress</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.420" end="01:28:07.130" style="s2">opponents so this is why we</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.229" end="01:28:10.070" style="s2">that sometimes after a war things will</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.130" end="01:28:11.510" style="s2">be kind of state you know leveled the</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.070" end="01:28:13.579" style="s2">playing field will be a bit leveled and</p>

<p begin="01:28:45.019" end="01:28:49.699" style="s2">keeps the inequalities keep getting more</p>

<p begin="01:29:00.110" end="01:29:03.139" style="s2">look at these new entrepreneurs who</p>

<p begin="01:29:13.309" end="01:29:16.820" style="s2">a great equalizer and decentralized</p>

<p begin="01:29:19.939" end="01:29:22.159" style="s2">there were the only people that could</p>

<p begin="01:29:23.959" end="01:29:30.590" style="s2">everybody could but then of course what</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.300" end="01:29:32.900" style="s2">it means is you&#39;ve got Google and</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.590" end="01:29:36.469" style="s2">Facebook that own pretty much all of the</p>

<p begin="01:29:40.729" end="01:29:46.639" style="s2">stations previously had and so it the</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.780" end="01:29:49.070" style="s2">technology that supposedly was going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.639" end="01:29:50.329" style="s2">decentralize it the you remember that</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.070" end="01:29:52.400" style="s2">revolvers were going to be a great</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.329" end="01:29:54.999" style="s2">equalizer in a similar way right the</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.400" end="01:30:01.939" style="s2">technology that&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.999" end="01:30:03.919" style="s2">decentralize the power a cemetry will</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.939" end="01:30:05.869" style="s2">eventually end up getting captured to</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.919" end="01:30:07.669" style="s2">create a more intense power asymmetry</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.869" end="01:30:09.499" style="s2">because the technology equals more power</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.669" end="01:30:10.939" style="s2">and that ends up being captured by those</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.499" end="01:30:13.060" style="s2">who are better at doing the more power</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.939" end="01:30:23.260" style="s2">thing the only way out of that</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.060" end="01:30:26.920" style="s2">I know of is a radically empowered in a</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.260" end="01:30:29.740" style="s2">healthy and effective way base that</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.920" end="01:30:31.600" style="s2">because otherwise we say okay well</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.740" end="01:30:33.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not possible so we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.600" end="01:30:34.570" style="s2">have everyone engaged cuz people are too</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.070" end="01:30:36.040" style="s2">lazy and stupid and unwilling and</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.570" end="01:30:37.090" style="s2">whatever and so we need to at least just</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.040" end="01:30:38.470" style="s2">pick better representatives</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.090" end="01:30:40.030" style="s2">representatives will do a good job will</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.470" end="01:30:41.890" style="s2">create a thing called a state that is</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.030" end="01:30:43.600" style="s2">gonna regulate and bind the predatory</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.890" end="01:30:46.120" style="s2">aspects of market so the market can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.600" end="01:30:48.130" style="s2">cut down the trees in the areas we call</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.120" end="01:30:49.660" style="s2">state parks and they can&#39;t do organized</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.130" end="01:30:50.170" style="s2">crime even though it&#39;s profitable and</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.660" end="01:30:51.850" style="s2">they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.170" end="01:30:54.070" style="s2">whatever dump all their stuff in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.850" end="01:30:55.690" style="s2">drinking water so we&#39;re gonna create</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.070" end="01:30:59.260" style="s2">regulatory bodies that keep them from</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.690" end="01:31:00.730" style="s2">the bind the market so then the markets</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.260" end="01:31:03.040" style="s2">primary goal is to capture those</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.730" end="01:31:04.660" style="s2">regulatory bodies right any anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.040" end="01:31:06.280" style="s2">doing well in the market that is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.660" end="01:31:08.290" style="s2">do less well if the regulators are</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.280" end="01:31:09.790" style="s2">successful their primary agenda is to</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.290" end="01:31:11.800" style="s2">debase the integrity of the regulator</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.790" end="01:31:13.870" style="s2">and they can do that with legislation</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.800" end="01:31:15.310" style="s2">because the lobbyists are lawyers that</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.870" end="01:31:16.420" style="s2">have to be paid for by somebody and who</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.310" end="01:31:19.750" style="s2">has the money to pay them as the</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.420" end="01:31:21.940" style="s2">corporate interests the campaign budgets</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.750" end="01:31:23.890" style="s2">have to be paid for by somebody the</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.940" end="01:31:25.870" style="s2">campaign budgets of your opponent will</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.890" end="01:31:28.210" style="s2">get a lot of you know support and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.870" end="01:31:30.220" style="s2">only got four years in office blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.210" end="01:31:31.540" style="s2">blah right so it&#39;s very easy to see how</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.220" end="01:31:33.400" style="s2">the market is up capturing the</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.540" end="01:31:36.220" style="s2">regulatory forces to then end up doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.400" end="01:31:38.080" style="s2">their bidding so now we have banks that</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.220" end="01:31:40.450" style="s2">get bailed out when they actually should</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.080" end="01:31:42.160" style="s2">go bankrupt and oil companies that are</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.450" end="01:31:44.410" style="s2">subsidized like that&#39;s not a market what</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.160" end="01:31:46.210" style="s2">the and that&#39;s also not the healthy</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.410" end="01:31:48.340" style="s2">kind of binding the predatory aspects</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.210" end="01:31:50.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a crony capitalist type thing so</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.340" end="01:31:53.650" style="s2">if the regulator&#39;s are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.890" end="01:31:55.660" style="s2">able to bind the market type dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.650" end="01:31:57.340" style="s2">where the the predatory parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.660" end="01:31:59.440" style="s2">market they got asymmetric power over</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.340" end="01:32:01.390" style="s2">everybody else well who is it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.440" end="01:32:03.520" style="s2">going to check the regulator&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.390" end="01:32:05.290" style="s2">though the accountability of the</p>

<p begin="01:32:14.230" end="01:32:19.510" style="s2">and we can look at examples and other</p>

<p begin="01:32:46.640" end="01:32:50.929" style="s2">you see how much the study of the</p>

<p begin="01:32:50.929" end="01:32:55.280" style="s2">that would be relevant for this got cut</p>

<p begin="01:36:05.130" end="01:36:09.660" style="s2">are inspired by this and simply didn&#39;t</p>
