<p begin="00:00:04.319" end="00:00:07.600" style="s2">saturday morning table where we talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:10.000" style="s2">about our projects</p>

<p begin="00:00:10.000" end="00:00:14.320" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.960" end="00:00:14.320" style="s2">is there anybody who&#39;d like to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.799" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">i can start i got a quick one i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:22.640" style="s2">been working on my projects</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:23.920" style="s2">at all uh so uh and i can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.640" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">anything i really need help with</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.920" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">right now so nothing</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.840" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">but who&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:37.840" style="s2">i guess i can go next all right my</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.160" end="00:00:39.680" style="s2">project is wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.840" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">uh meant to fight misinformation in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.680" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">politics science and news</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve been working with matush on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:49.039" style="s2">prototype um</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:50.480" style="s2">might have to ask him to skip this thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:51.680" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to do because</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.480" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">it seems to be overkill for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.680" end="00:00:54.960" style="s2">prototype and it&#39;s making things take</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.360" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">longer than</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.960" end="00:00:58.160" style="s2">i was hoping um so hoping to get that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.160" end="00:01:04.000" style="s2">soon and then once the uh current</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">version that&#39;s being worked on is online</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:07.760" style="s2">uh we&#39;ll be pivoting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:09.760" style="s2">get con varadi online which will be</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.760" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">similar to wiki election but uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">gonna be for organizations and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:16.000" style="s2">emphasis on just</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">the generic parts of wiki election sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.000" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">as i said the organization news content</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">review</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">that sort of thing uh so we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:25.840" style="s2">starting on that and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">probably more focusing on confronting</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.840" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">because the content review is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">the first thing to start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">so uh hopefully pivoting there</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">or just having the prototype online if</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s done that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">you know in the current way but i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">think of anything i need help with</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">that&#39;s not already behind</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.880" end="00:01:49.360" style="s2">all right i&#39;m jubilee and my project</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">is myself i&#39;m my own project</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.360" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">because it changes week tweak but</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">solution raising this last week uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">we didn&#39;t actually hold the solution</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">raising we had it on relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">i showed up and no one was there right</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">away and i was not really in the mood so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">anyway people call them came in late but</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t there so we&#39;re gonna re-hold</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">the solution raising this wednesday</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">i feel like the universe gave me the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">week off because we also cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">yesterday last minute</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">uh because i had a my kid had a play</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">date that was only able to happen that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">and then bentley wasn&#39;t able to come so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">it made sense to cancel it</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">seen as what we&#39;re working on needs all</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">of us um</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been just playing with in my head</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:29.599" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">anti-mlm mlm that and what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">like and how i</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">how i get people involved they can help</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">create that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">so that i&#39;m not doing the work from</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">myself all of it myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">because i don&#39;t i can&#39;t do that part so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t really know exactly what i would</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">need help with because i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">to communicate what i would need help</p>

<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">and making it look pretty but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">where i was almost late to this because</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">i was</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">i was working on something for it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where i&#39;m at this week</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">cool i did um have</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">an idea i want to run past everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">this is probably more of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">a friday thing than a saturday</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">thing you know um you know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">talking about like project directories</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">and such like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s a thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">murmurations</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">network where you on your own website</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">you can put data</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">about your project and then anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">then build a directory of these projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">so that you&#39;re not having to update a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">database or multiple central databases</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">for projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">but what i don&#39;t like about that is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">takes a bit of technical skill and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">website so you have to have like</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">wordpress or something</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">um so i often think about like jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">in situations like this that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">you know it wouldn&#39;t be something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">you would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">to do easily enough um so i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;d be nice if you could literally just</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">have any website that you or that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">have access to where you could just put</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">text in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">and it&#39;d still be searchable through</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">google to find</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">the thing oh i i put this text in about</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">my project and it&#39;s machine readable</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">and can be put in a directory but still</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">be kind of human writable</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">although i guess one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">with that is that like you can&#39;t put it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">in facebook</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">because for the facebook is an index the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">individual pages aren&#39;t often indexed by</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">google</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">if they were it would still be hard for</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">computers to read because oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">they make it where you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">login or something you can&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">that data to post up consistently</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know like jubilee there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">other like</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">websites that you put data in our social</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">media things do you use any other tech</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:04.320" style="s2">other than what facebook to use twitter</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">i mean yes but i don&#39;t can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.320" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">list them all</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">i use instagram as of recently and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">will go on discord you know as much as i</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">i will figure it out for the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">community in groups</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">um but solving things just for my</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">project isn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite make sense but it is um</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">somebody posted in our group about a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">project called frontier</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">or pioneer something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t look very gamey at all to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">me but</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">the same concept seems like anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">but uh yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">i guess one thing that like like if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">said okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">there&#39;s no central database where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">allowed to put in your project data for</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">projects but you go someplace and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">and you write this out</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">and then go and put the link somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">index it so i guess theoretically you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">could go on medium</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">create a medium account and post it</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">there and then you could also use medium</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">to post about your things</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">stuff like that i don&#39;t know so i just</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:12.680" style="s2">want to see whether that seemed like an</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.680" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">decentralized solution</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">for this project yeah especially for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">medium i mean again i&#39;m not the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">because i can&#39;t necessarily type it out</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">but i would from you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">for that like i</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">keep up the word document sometimes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">i mean it would</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">it would just be here&#39;s a the name of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">the project here&#39;s a quick description</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">which i know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:37.680" style="s2">sometimes the hardest part and then it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">would be like</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:42.880" style="s2">here&#39;s the uh categories of this project</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">you know is it technology is it all that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.880" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">so there&#39;d be and there&#39;d be like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">website you&#39;d go and type in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:50.720" style="s2">your data and it would format it for you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">and you can cut it and paste it in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.720" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">medium</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">um kind of like that&#39;s the way the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">murmurations network does it but they</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">give you a json file and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">if i&#39;m not a technical person what am i</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:03.520" style="s2">going to do with the json file</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:05.039" style="s2">um so i just want to make it lower tech</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">and and not to where you have to own a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">website but you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">be on someone else&#39;s is it this database</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">associated with</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">tech well</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">uh i mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">so it would be decentralized so uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">anyone could then create a database off</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">of this info</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">right so i in the end though what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.599" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">would be is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">it&#39;d be just like our the the drupal</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">site that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">that we&#39;re working on or or the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">knack site or the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">um the wiki site but instead of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">going to put in the data</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">you would put the data somewhere that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">you have control of and then you would</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">tell the site about it and then it would</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">build a directory</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">and that way you&#39;re in control of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">data you don&#39;t have to if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">multiple of these directories you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">have to go to each one and update your</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">data you just update it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">um so that&#39;s kind of the idea it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">kind of decentralizing it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">definitely sounds interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">realistically a more game b</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">ish approach yeah that&#39;s what i was</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">radic do i need to repeat any of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">you came in halfway through i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">if it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">what i was suggesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">i go to the decentralized database and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">it tells me everything i need</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">well yeah it&#39;s a little different it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">just be a text format that you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">type into</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">medium or what&#39;s what&#39;s another free</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">ghost oh i&#39;m not familiar with that one</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">yeah so yeah just any non-technical</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">person could create an account</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">somewhere it just it wouldn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">facebook it might work for twitter</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">um and then you know we could you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">anyways that was my idea um</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">so i just wanted to see if anyone saw</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">any problems with it like it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">okay right do you want to give us an</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">update on your project</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">uh my project is uh waiting</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">for me to have time um</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">and actually it&#39;s waiting also</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">for me to get some more ideas about uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">some non-technical um</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">philosophical things more likely</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">about the direction um in connection</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">mostly to what we discussed like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">elsewhere on monday uh which</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">also gave me some inspiration to uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">look in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">like different directions of where to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">get data from</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:06.399" style="s2">and how to present it and yeah generally</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t much progress on that front</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.399" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">on the other hand there was finally</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">progress on the</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">not tested well enough but done to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">me checking it in uh today and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">uh to the where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">accessible on the web uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">i called it uh most of we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">one problem with um not a problem but</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">one thing about it is uh the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">first version of the prototype was built</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">on slightly different assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">than uh then um</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">like well discovered that what would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">better to to um</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">make it like and so it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">kind of uh it&#39;s slightly messy inside</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:05.279" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">uh it&#39;s going in a very good direction</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.279" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:12.480" style="s2">uh being more abstract on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">like backhand side and it&#39;s still of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">the weaker action we discussed but uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s also um on the back end uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">slightly different from the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">version so</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">when i check it in we can discuss and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">can show you what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">mean by all this so progress on that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">front</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s pretty much it</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.839" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">so the other thing reddick is done</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">talking i</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">i understand that if someone talks on</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">facebook and i respond it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">respond to facebook no one responds to</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">uh nathan&#39;s nathan waters</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">post about uh him wanting to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">something very similar</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">similar i think to what we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">um yeah i was curious about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">because it seems it is very similar in</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">uh slightly different ideas but um</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">then again i think he&#39;s australian</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">he was saying for game b projects he</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">tends to start uh commons owned</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:15.200" style="s2">uh structure oh right open source</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">with 100 open source products no stock</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">shares et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">yeah it sounded kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">sounds like he has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">specific things in mind that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">sure what 100 agree with ours</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">at the very least it might end up being</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">like another similar one which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">personally not against i&#39;d kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">to have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">different variations live so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">you know do some a b</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">testing that&#39;s sort of with boards</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">because you know there&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">like everyone having the exact same pay</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to work for</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">you know for example having lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">yeah plus once again we have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">terminology problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">if you uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">still open sources it technically can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">be for profit if there are not stocks</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">and shares</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s two contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">things um because</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">profit goes to stockholders profit goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">to stocks oh</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.559" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">software than chairs that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">the definition</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">well profit is just the money you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">after your expenses</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">right uh but for an organization you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">be for profit and you just don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">shareholders because you don&#39;t have i</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">just don&#39;t think you well no but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">still have owners</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">um which right but profit</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">sharing you can&#39;t do without</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">shareholders and stuff like that because</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">who do you give it to but a company can</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">be for-profit because that just means</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">that the company behaves in a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">that you know it wants revenue and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">keep expenses low</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">well there&#39;s a lot of companies that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">have revenue that don&#39;t have profit</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">and are not so non-profits have it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">writing ownership so if one person owns</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">it or a collective owns it then yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">don&#39;t need shares the profit goes to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">them they can figure that out but if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">multiple investors well then how much do</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">they own then you need to issue shares</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">and you need to know how much</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">yeah governance and that&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">important for profit sharing because if</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">you&#39;re actually saying like</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">okay but do i get 100 or 101 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">from this profit sharing like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">the exact amount then yeah right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">math involved there and how much shares</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">and where&#39;s it coming from and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">actual cut do you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">as opposed to if it&#39;s just hey no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">got shares because we all own it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t get the profit based on your</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">ownership the profit just goes back into</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">the company</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">and hopefully it&#39;s got profit otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not a very good for profit company</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">yeah yeah i just there&#39;s yeah with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">terminology used there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">open questions yeah i think there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">he mentions having everything 100 open</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">source</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">and then later says like having like</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:55.679" style="s2">legal protections and stuff to stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">gaming companies from using our attack</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.679" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">like but it&#39;s open source so can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">do that anyway well you can do copy live</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">or whatever right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">defending how you license it and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">like that but even then they could use</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:09.440" style="s2">it and just</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">figure out what their lawyers how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">license that one product differently</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">yeah so i don&#39;t see any large</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">differences between what we&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">what he&#39;s suggesting except maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">you know yeah because like same salary</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">is that everyone gets a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">a split of the profits</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">or does it mean that everyone has a set</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">salary</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">right is how you know figuring right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">if you&#39;ve interrupted you bentley sorry</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">go ahead it&#39;s gonna say that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">anything that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">like what we&#39;re doing what he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">to do what there&#39;s a few other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">the more generic we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">right the more that whatever together</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">tech is it&#39;s together tech</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not deciding on how wikileaks has</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">its governance or how even if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">own something it might be a different</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">entity deciding on the governance</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">deciding on on</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">um how it&#39;s run so that their test a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">test be</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">right say hey which one works better</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">which one works for how do we have fun</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">um how do we everyone&#39;s making the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">way joey now no one&#39;s working you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s somewhat written set in stone</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like a constitutional document</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">we want that constitutional document to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">be as as um</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">centralized for like the central</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">organization and then it&#39;s free for</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">everyone else and i think that is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">difference that maybe we have come to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">over i know i have over the last year of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">like right</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">the more rigid it is as much as i might</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">like the written like i like that things</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">are open source like that things are</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">transparent it&#39;s always like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">always a thing that breaks it a reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">not to be and so having it more just</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">that it is transparent about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">transparency</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.679" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">or just those those kind of things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.039" style="s2">there isn&#39;t one person&#39;s brain is going</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">to come up with the best solution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.039" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">having multiple structures having</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">multiple things and then we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">out which one works and playing in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">space and i think we are doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">partly because we brought together our</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">and right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">i kind of like the idea of setting a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">range for things like so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">this thing everyone makes the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">might be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">the lowest or highest level in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">range depending on how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">you want to think about it and then the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">actual thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">you know the foundational document or</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">like the thing here here&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">trying to work towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">is having like you know a cap on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">multiplication of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">lowest the highest paid and saying like</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re saying like</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">in order to be a part of this it has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">be capped i don&#39;t know three or five or</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">ten</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">or whatever that cap ends up being but</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">like you can still</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">be in the you know the club if you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">a five times pay cap</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">but like past that you really game b</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">which even though something like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">was let&#39;s say i come in and i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">for your organization for an hour a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">month and so i&#39;m making 50 bucks or even</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">a hundred bucks</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">well i hope that somebody&#39;s making 10</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">100 times right</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">true yeah it would end up being like</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">probably an hourly</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">calculation and true really not not how</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">some executives are like i&#39;m technically</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">working all the time</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">no no that that&#39;s not how this works</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">so i keep seeing this as uh like a node</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">in the network the network is one but</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">uh there will be like multiple nodes and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">maybe testing uh it&#39;s kind of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">that but um</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">what it is is more like people having</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">their own ideas and feeling better with</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">some particular set of rules and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:44.480" style="s2">way of doing stuff which just fits them</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">better and they are more productive</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.480" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">if things are set in exactly this way as</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">opposed to slightly different way over</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">and yeah the network is one but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">notes are</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">multiple and the important thing here is</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">and what i would like to see emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">the network of nodes that are not</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">fighting each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">not competing against each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">but more like cooperating and finding</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">their own niche</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">that would be ideal i think and for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">nodes are you you&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">almost having</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">a second one of these that operates on</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">a slightly different rule set and kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">of having them both try to work together</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">towards the same end like where</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">where realistic not making the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">exactly the same product because that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">would be a waste of resources and energy</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">but more like um i mean more like</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">attempting to be a game b corporation</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">right we&#39;re like have the same ish rules</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">trying to get like not having for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:29:00.399" style="s2">you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">not having profit sharing at least not</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">on like you know a mass scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">with the shareholders that don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">um having a cap on the you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">pay multiplication what whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">it&#39;s like separation of concerns and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">of uh some things but um</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">it&#39;s more like uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">being it&#39;s like a fractal thing of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">um i mean i see the network as being</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">uh as consisting of like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">fractal structure where uh there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">multiple</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:41.760" style="s2">not companies not corporations but uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">more like daos</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.760" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">um which uh group</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">people with similar interests and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">similar um</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">maybe projects that would ideally be one</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">project they are working on</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">instead of having like 100 individuals</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">working on 100 projects it would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">better to have 10 groups of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">10 individuals working on 10 different</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">projects different enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">uh for them to be useful to stay</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">different and separate but still be in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">like contacted enough to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">not go directly and try to make better</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">the same product but better than the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">competition just around the corner</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">right so a network of uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">game b projects game beach right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.279" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">i wonder if that gets into like</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">collusion territory technically</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s fine it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">we&#39;re not really in the same industry</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">yet and it&#39;s not like we&#39;re price fixing</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to avoid stepping on each</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">other&#39;s toes at least until</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of enough corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">people are big enough that like</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">you know if we get to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">there&#39;s 10 corporations and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">worth over a billion dollars we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">okay more than one of us can make</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">cookies now</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">because we&#39;re like we have enough that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">we can actually start to compete and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">start to have different product</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:30:59.760" style="s2">offerings</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">yeah probably not good to start there</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">like us both start off making the exact</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">same tech that&#39;s just asking for it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:06.159" style="s2">fail</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">because i think what we end up with is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">if we have something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">converati one of the ways i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">able to assess corporations is like</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">how game b are they right and and have</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">things like okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">the pay cap and what&#39;s the minimum pay</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">and what&#39;s and what&#39;s stuff like that so</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">if you say you know i want to be rigid</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">and i want to say only people who have</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">equal pay and the minimum pay is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:31.120" style="s2">great here&#39;s the two companies that do</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">that okay i i want you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.120" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">at most of five times multiplication and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">pay</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">okay here&#39;s a slightly bigger list</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">yeah although about this i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">um as i commented on this</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">uh about specifically this part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:58.840" style="s2">uh there is something to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">the salary the pay being exactly equal</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">and what i didn&#39;t write because</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">i thought about it only after i posted</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">um the goal</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">really is to make money not as important</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">yeah you get paid of course because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">need the money to live but</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">uh otherwise the motivation should never</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">be money itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s like working for profit and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">for short um thing to say is</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s they may and we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">so uh it should not be motivating people</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">work and to do stuff the motivation is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">the best motivation is always internal</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2">and i do stuff because i want to and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">it&#39;s useful enough so it&#39;s appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">network and the public and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">money i get is um less important</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">this it should be separated it</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:32:59.919" style="s2">should be shouldn&#39;t be i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">the long-term goal</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.919" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">but if it comes down to like okay paying</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">everyone the same and that means that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">can&#39;t get a decent lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">then if a lawyer is only willing to work</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">you know even like if they&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">reduced pay but like they aren&#39;t willing</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">to work for 80 000</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">then i would say then i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">we need to pay them more</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">like that&#39;s where i&#39;m and i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">long term yeah we we want to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">people that want to be there and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">in theory would work for less because</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">they&#39;re actually doing something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">they want to do and something that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">want to be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">but i think that sort of long term like</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">for now is just to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">you know butts and seats if we decode</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">her</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">and we can&#39;t find somebody you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">that&#39;s super passionate but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">somebody over here just when they get</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">paid for work cool let&#39;s just get it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">before we get on board the generation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">generation of people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">really understand what it means to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">internal motivation</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">and can be also awesome</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">lawyers and of some whatevers</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">and be motivated by the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">they do because they want to instead of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">being paid</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">then yeah i totally have um it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">to be strict on this requirement</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">uh because the result would be not</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">getting the best</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">loyal lawyer help or the best caller</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">right that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">because you just you know shut yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">i do agree with your core concept though</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">that like you want people that want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">be there</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">and i think for the most part that will</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">mean taking a pay cut from a game a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">world which you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s not willing to do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">yeah maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">you know that i think will be a sweet</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">spot where like to very start with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">might just end up being you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.560" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">pay</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">someone on parity to what they would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">expecting but long term yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">even for lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">you can pay them less than you would you</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">a corporate lawyer but not like what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">pay the lowest paid person in a gaming</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">company or even here right because</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">if we&#39;re saying starting wages 80 well</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">corporate lawyers make well into six</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">figures so if they made half that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">working for this corporation that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">significant pay cut still well into six</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">figures though</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">of course ideally you would not need</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">the less rigidity right like what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">creating with the i have my own</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">structure of like 120 000</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">is the cap and there&#39;s these these parts</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">of it but that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">that things rigidity and so if that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t call in people it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">fail</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">right and if we don&#39;t if what we create</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">with product we create with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:40.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t enticing enough to keep drawing in</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">people then that is going to fail</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.400" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">but having it be what am i trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">that all of the different incentives for</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">all the different nodes</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">is like right where do i choose to put</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:51.359" style="s2">my labor where do i choose to go and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.359" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">the less rigidity there is like if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">amazing at something but the pay</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">structure is off for me it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">can i</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">do i then create a competing product do</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">i then</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s like it all interplays in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">of like the more we can bring it down to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:09.760" style="s2">the nodes and bring it down to write as</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.760" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">individual how am i incentivized and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">the less we try to what is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">either blanket that and say everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">incentivized the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">or make it very rigid that like you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">to like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be able to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">problem because it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">able to be as</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">fluid as it needs to be to be like like</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t i want my money and needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">separate than my purpose and my</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">and what i&#39;m what i&#39;m doing with my life</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">because they don&#39;t work for me when</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">they&#39;re intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">but for other people it might be the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">opposite right it&#39;s like no i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">be happy at all unless you pay me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:47.119" style="s2">choosing to focus more on the internal</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">motivation</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.119" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">of sticking with what you want to do for</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">free</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">and then if you can get paid for it</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:55.920" style="s2">great but if you&#39;re never paid for what</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do for free</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t care what everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">doing and i&#39;m talking to someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">on monday who has a somewhat similar</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">project about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">the data and and selling your you own</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">your own data and you sell it and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.839" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t because then you&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">like whatever it&#39;s breaking the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">incentives in my brain because i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">wait then am i gonna sell it to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">for-profit companies or am i gonna sell</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">it for cancer research</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">am i gonna like where am i actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">gonna put it it changes the whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">incentive</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">instead of like right game is [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">let&#39;s just trade a whole new incentive</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">where we&#39;re not necessarily paying</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">people and it&#39;s volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">because like what is volunteer versus a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">right if you have volunteers working for</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">you and someone making 120 000</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">that&#39;s an infinite increase so it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">the game b</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">but no it doesn&#39;t because volunteers are</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">system right than people who are who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">getting paid for something but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:52.960" style="s2">i&#39;m rambling on</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">and there&#39;s one more thing actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.960" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">because uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s that is some foundational</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">assumption about</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">um incentivizing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">money and uh and everything the this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">idea of money has been um</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">actually something real enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">so we when we talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2">it&#39;s talking about salary but um</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">jubilee you said something uh that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.720" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">it made sense like the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">as in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">people usually um</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">want better money because of something</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">just you know i mean i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">lawyers they might be just satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">you know the number uh on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">on the bank account it may mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">something to some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">but uh maybe generally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">uh and for most of the people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">and they are motivated to get salary in</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.359" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">range of</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">200 000 for example but not because they</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">want 200 000 but because they</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">want what they really want is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">house that is specifically this and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">so expensive that they need 200 000 but</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2">uh this slightly changes the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">if what they want is this big perfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">maybe in some future</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">uh what can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">changed with enough resources and if the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">network is big enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">and if we actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">start talking about motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">internal motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">why even i want the very big house which</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">costs</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">that much money that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">something there and maybe the solution</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">not to give people</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">and talk about giving 200 000 but</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:02.960" style="s2">talking about uh how to provide them</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">what they really</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">really want and ideally uh how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">uh i was going to say how to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.440" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">get to the real motivation because even</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">behind</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">having a very big house with you know um</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">and very expensive maybe there is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">other internal</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">motivation hidden behind it right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">there are multiple layers of why right</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">so are you talking about like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">internal motivations that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">that that you were talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">where that is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">the most ideal employee is somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">who&#39;s super interested in the project</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">and the company and all that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">in theory they work for free if money</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">an issue but because they have to eat</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">you know we still have to pay off</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">um so that&#39;s like the top of the stack i</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:58.000" style="s2">think almost everybody would agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">with that um and then what i think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">hearing</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">is like okay so if our goal is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">but we still need to make sure people</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">can eat and have a roof over their head</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">is having something like a campus where</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">you&#39;re like hey</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:21.680" style="s2">or 100 but like</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">your room and board and this and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.680" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">all that&#39;s paid for so you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">okay now</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">you&#39;re making less but you&#39;re net</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:31.680" style="s2">sort of like what you&#39;ve got to spend is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">more because</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">well yeah i&#39;m not making as much money</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:36.560" style="s2">but i also don&#39;t have to pay rent</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">which right there it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.560" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">making more money yeah i know i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:41.599" style="s2">hearing</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">that like i would love that i would work</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.599" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">at a company</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">like that in a second assuming that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">know it was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">a a nice place and they allow dogs and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">blah blah and these same things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">they go into</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">deciding where to live but if that were</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">an option</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">i think that would be cool and i know</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard that from a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:01.920" style="s2">both from like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:02.800" style="s2">i want to work there and i want to start</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.920" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">that company</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.800" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard both yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">i i wonder if i make it uh like</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.079" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">very clear enough because i um</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">the idea is that um</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">we are not discussing how much money we</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:25.839" style="s2">are not discussing money at</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">this point what we are talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.839" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">fulfilling uh needs of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">people who uh because</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">motivation even internal is like two</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">one is uh what would you be doing uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t have to earn</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">any money if all your needs were</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">just fulfilled like the house you want</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">yacht you want the car you want every</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">you have everything what you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.440" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">and that is the real internal motivation</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">i would like to be coding this</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">whether i have something or not and if i</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">don&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">if i wanted to if i don&#39;t want sorry</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">if i don&#39;t work on what i really want i</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">only i need to work for enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">money elsewhere to just you know have</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">all my needs fulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">and the other internal motivation is</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">for some people it&#39;s enough to have like</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">basic shelter</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">i mean normal house and normal food and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">a car that is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">uh something basic not</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">rolls royce or something so um and some</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">for whatever reason uh they</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">don&#39;t feel good enough about i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">know about themselves or about the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">or about</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">anything if they don&#39;t have the ferrari</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">if i want to have a ferrari that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">i want and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">no period the end i want this</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">and if i don&#39;t have it i will work uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">i will need to work for enough money to</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">in order to be able to get it</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">so the question then is uh well first of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">um how to get such a person to uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">really discover why exactly they need</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">this this specific car</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">or do something very expensive uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:23.440" style="s2">because it might be that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">uh there is and that&#39;s psychology right</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.440" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing and um</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">yeah and the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">um maybe it&#39;s there is some</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">way of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.319" style="s2">thing to them this is what they really</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">want if</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">this is what really makes them happy for</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">whatever reason uh maybe there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">for the company to actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">accommodate this swish and if the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">company owned</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">a factory of ferraris then it would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">easier to you know okay this is your</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">ferrari and now</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">please do whatever you are uh doing</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">second</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">you&#39;re just doing it from the other side</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">whereas if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something about it if it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">those those sound like fun needs but</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">they&#39;re not like tied to our purpose</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">i like like that internal motivation is</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">different than the external motivation</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">and to be able to tear those like why do</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">i want a ferrari is it so that i have</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">one and no one else does because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">ever going to be solved in game b</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">because anyone can have it right so if</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">i want it because it&#39;s fast and pretty</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">cool everyone could have a fast pretty</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">car</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">right like those are different than your</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">internal motivation is to be better than</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">everyone else right well</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">sorry can&#39;t be guaranteed but you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">get the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">anyway that there&#39;s just a difference in</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">the corporation doing it versus us doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">it for each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">there because a different motivation</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">like how do you decide who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">got a worthy one and then are they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">they worthy enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">to be someone who we meet their needs</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">even if when they&#39;re extravagant</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">right and i mean your turn that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">actually one thing that game</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">has solved is that okay you control that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">just by how much we pay you and how much</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">you make</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">great you go figure that out any ques</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">like any questions about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">decide who gets a ferrari that&#39;s 20</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">years down the road</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">right that&#39;s like the if the company</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">actually has enough resources</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">so i think like there&#39;s two very</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">different conversations there&#39;s what do</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">we do you know today slash over the next</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">year or two</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">and then there&#39;s what are we working</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:17.920" style="s2">towards and i think the what are we</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">working towards yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.920" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">less emphasized on the salary hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:23.680" style="s2">having other benefits that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">are sort of you know communal and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.680" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">company can do this at scale we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">we have a billion dollars yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">lot of stuff that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">that we can do to improve the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">our employees for way cheaper than just</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">paying the money</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">and they still see a benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:39.280" style="s2">everyone gets the same benefit and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">hey we&#39;ve got more money to spend as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">company to grow</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">and hire even more people great</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">distinction both with like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">planning you know the specifics on how</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">we&#39;re going to operate and then also</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:54.640" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">core values more</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">should just work for both as much as</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">possible like the short term</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:01.839" style="s2">and long term and if they don&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:03.520" style="s2">admit like hey</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">if we have this value it might prevent</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.520" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">us from launching but five years down</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">the road you know we should</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">consider it or however that might work</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">and one thing about game a also and</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">ferraris is</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">that um a ferrari is a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">status and um it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">when you see it when i see it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">as much as a yeah that&#39;s a fast pretty</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">car but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">it&#39;s something more and that something</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">more is actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">uh well to the advertisement taught us</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">this thing because in itself it&#39;s a fast</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">car which is impractical</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">it&#39;s expensive and i don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">a route i can drive it to the full</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">capability of the of the car so it</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense for me to have it</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.440" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">and still i want it but why because</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:49:02.000" style="s2">well because i&#39;ve been motivated</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s totally external so that is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">parallel</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">uh thread of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">additional work for a game b company</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:14.839" style="s2">which would be ideally providing</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">services</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.839" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">to um immunize</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">people from advertisement and to uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">really like make them um understand</p>

<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">and possibly fix this to the point of</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">okay you won&#39;t do this but is it the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">is do you want it just because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">been uh kind of cursed</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:40.720" style="s2">to uh to want it or is it because</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:44.400" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">that uh you know i myself would be happy</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.400" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">if the company uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">could provide the ferrari to some person</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">who really</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">wants it and i would see it as</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">oh okay i would see it as</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.520" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">um i wouldn&#39;t look at it as something</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">uh as a symbol of status i would look at</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">it as</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:12.240" style="s2">not pity the person who wants the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">ferrari for whatever reason but i would</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.240" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">still see it as</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">okay some people want the stuff which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">totally impractical</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">that&#39;s their kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">problem but if they really really need</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.760" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">it that&#39;s uh the cure the temporary cure</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">uh for the symptoms is to just give it</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:35.440" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">uh and then later on we can discuss uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.440" end="00:50:39.920" style="s2">the real cure which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">going inside the head and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.920" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">fix whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">wrong there let&#39;s also keep in mind some</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">people just like cars yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">if you just want to fry because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">like that car is so sexy cool all right</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">yeah and that might be what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">working towards although you might</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">in that case you might i mean some some</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">of the idea i don&#39;t need is ownership</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">but also just</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">you know maybe if there&#39;s a fleet of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">cars and you have a special weekend</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">coming up you can borrow it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">you&#39;ll take care of it totally and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.079" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">is part of knowing why you want it right</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">do you want to drive it</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">on your birthday or do you want it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">do you want to erase it because then we</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">can just rent a racetrack and take</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">everybody that wants to do that we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">that once again</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">oh wow exactly cool yeah and i like i</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">like the idea like the uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">not necessarily getting rid of marketing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have control over game</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s a certain what you said is</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:28.559" style="s2">true right that if</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">like i it doesn&#39;t matter what position i</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.559" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">am in in society</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">if my needs are like right i need a</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">person like that like it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">different it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">they have a greedy disability it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">they are really hurting for that status</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">for those things they can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s like right i have things</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">that i really love and want and maybe it</p>

<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">but when you you need to have all the</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">like if you want a mansion in a world</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">where no one&#39;s cleaning your mansion for</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.800" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">do you really want a mansion do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">really want that big of an upkeep right</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">no i want a small</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">giant yard no gardeners have fun with</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">that exactly and so it becomes like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like not even we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:17.040" style="s2">mansions it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:18.319" style="s2">we&#39;re not building new ones you go flip</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.040" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">in one of the ones other people have</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.319" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">and when you realize that&#39;s not for you</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">and then figure out</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">how you want to work with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">housekeeping and gardening and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">everything else situation</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">you figure you figure that out and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">let us know how it works for you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:31.599" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like a bunch of co-workers</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">living together being like i&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.599" end="00:52:34.079" style="s2">gardener</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">i&#39;m the chef that sounds sweet i&#39;ll live</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.079" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">in that mansion</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">it seems like the metric there is really</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:45.359" style="s2">mental health and satisfaction of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">people involved and like radix says</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.359" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:49.119" style="s2">you know there might be a situation</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">where we give them a ferrari because</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.119" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where they are at</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">and maybe they need to drive it around</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">and not be able to repair it or</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">something for a while you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">or just you know that may be the long</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">thing but also sometimes the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">thing would be like well we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">supply that now who makes that decision</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">and everything that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">an unknown</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">problem that&#39;s a problem we have no</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">solution for yet but something to work</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">yeah so something else that seems kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">of worth to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">to bring up here because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">relevant is what i was thinking of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">whole like</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">worker cooperative versus consumer</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">thing and i agree with jubilee&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">that like for a company it makes more</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">sense to be a consumer cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">because then that sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">encompasses you&#39;re actually selling</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">things too to make sure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:33.280" style="s2">getting the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:35.040" style="s2">useful information but it seems that in</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.280" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">that model a worker cooperative could</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.040" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">sort of become the union</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">and i wonder how much it&#39;s just okay the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.800" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">corporation deals with that union says</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:46.000" style="s2">here&#39;s you know how much money you get</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">you figure out amongst yourselves how</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.000" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">you want to divvy that up and what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">the benefits are and then if the union</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">gets big enough we&#39;re like hey we you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:55.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">are this union for a 10 billion billion</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.200" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">dollar company we have two</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">billion dollars to spend all right you</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">know once a year we&#39;re going to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">rent a a a racetrack and a bunch of cars</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">because we can afford it</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">if that&#39;s something that like okay are</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">there enough people here who want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">drive cars</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:12.880" style="s2">cool that&#39;s your benefit and then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">three months later you&#39;re gonna rent a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">yacht no you don&#39;t get to do all of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">things because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">limited capacity and you have to pick</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:24.720" style="s2">or something like that right like it can</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">work it out and where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">necessarily up to the company</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like the company&#39;s job is just to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">you know to basically make profit</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">and keep it within it so that it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">growing and so they can keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">giving money to that union and pay its</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">staff</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">and then it&#39;s up to the union to decide</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">on the pay cap to decide on</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">um you know all the extra</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">benefits that aren&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.839" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">salary-based</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.559" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">yeah if i if i could redirect in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">last five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">um one things that i was thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">we need when we have this together tech</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">is kind of a decision making tool but</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:09.680" style="s2">a way to say okay if you&#39;re donating</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">your 25</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.680" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">dollars a month or whatever we said how</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">are we as a group gonna decide</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:18.480" style="s2">where that money gets spent so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">it&#39;d be nice to have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">ongoing survey tool that says here are</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">here the project ideas anyone can throw</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">in an idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">here&#39;s the people that want to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">support it and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">is that something we should build on in</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">the short term</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">like if i&#39;m putting 25 and i&#39;m deciding</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">where that 25 dollars go or is</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">collectively we&#39;re deciding where the 25</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">dollars goes collectively</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:47.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know yeah it would be either</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">um but i think it would be just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.920" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">way to get a sentiment of all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">participants on where they would like</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">so if we get a new project how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.359" style="s2">kind of get feedback from everyone that</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">hey that&#39;s a good idea or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.359" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">something i would use</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">um that sort of thing and then later we</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">can work out the specific rules but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">or is there are two already out there</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">that that does that that&#39;s cheap and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">easy i think it is breaking</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">down for that piece right are you using</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:12.000" style="s2">it how much are you paying for it where</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">are you like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.000" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">if we&#39;re if we&#39;re paying 25 into a pool</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">part of that pool is that it needs to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">somewhat what a government does right</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">like would you choose for your tax</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">dollars to go to roads maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">right like even though you use them</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">constantly it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">something that you want to put money</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">if your kids aren&#39;t you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">have kids in their own school like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to put money towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">and those things come up time and time</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:38.559" style="s2">again when we&#39;re creating game b</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">right the scheduling app the wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:43.520" style="s2">all these things that aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">income generating and then it&#39;s so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.520" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">like the same thing happens if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.119" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">incentivized to only do what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">what&#39;s like going to be a benefit for us</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to be all the big</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">projects that get things</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:54.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s good to be the ones with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">most impact but there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">fringe ones that need</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s like if we could</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">like rank them in importance right oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">this needs to get done potholes need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:04.720" style="s2">get filled</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">roads need to be done whatever our</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.720" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">equivalent of that is right admin work</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:09.760" style="s2">this stuff needs to get done even if</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:11.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not sweet and sexy</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.760" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re probably gonna need to pay it</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.119" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s not sweet and sexy and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like that there&#39;s a way to possibly</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:17.920" style="s2">break it up where you are like what am i</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.119" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.920" end="00:57:21.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the most important what are all</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">these projects needing right</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.280" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">we all need the potholes filled we all</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">use the roads it&#39;s like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">yeah i like the idea of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">vote on that and also be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">just the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">yeah i think you kind of need a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">combination of both</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.599" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">where you&#39;ve got like okay if you give</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">you know 25 a month okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">10 of that you you know or 15 i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">sure which way it would go</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:44.480" style="s2">but like a slice of it you get to vote</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">on like</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.480" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">exactly where it goes like oh i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:48.640" style="s2">to fund those two projects great we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.440" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">going to take that amount and split it</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.640" end="00:57:51.680" style="s2">or you can say i want 80</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">here and 20 there cool you have full</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.680" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">control and then everything else goes to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">organization the corporation or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">where it spends it still</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">within lines of you know what that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:03.839" style="s2">corporation&#39;s charter says it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:05.280" style="s2">hey let&#39;s go start drilling for oil</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.839" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">well if that&#39;s in the charter i guess</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.280" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">but odds are it won&#39;t be um</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:12.319" style="s2">and so that then it&#39;s up to the like</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:15.680" style="s2">that group to say as a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">here&#39;s what we need so if</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.680" end="00:58:19.359" style="s2">the corporation needs roads even if</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">nobody&#39;s voting for it we&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.359" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">but we all agree that we need roads</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:24.880" style="s2">great we&#39;re going to spend the money out</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">of that out of that pool</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.880" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">or that&#39;s a bit more like taxes as</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">opposed to like</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">donations you kind of have both sides</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:33.359" style="s2">but try to streamline it so like you you</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">just give us 25</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.359" end="00:58:37.440" style="s2">a month well but 10 towards the projects</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">that you say that you want to spend it</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.440" end="00:58:41.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.839" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">then 15 towards the infrastructure the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.040" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">salaries the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.040" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">you know anything else that we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">need to keep this ship afloat</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.160" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">yeah out of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:56.000" style="s2">hundred uh they would be able to say for</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.000" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">um the ten percent is uh like fixed</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:06.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s going towards the uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">cooperation uh and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.480" end="00:59:11.200" style="s2">um maybe 25 percent uh for specific</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">projects that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.200" end="00:59:18.480" style="s2">the main person would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:19.599" style="s2">done and then more than 25 percent</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.480" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.599" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">like a set of projects that uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">the person considers worth actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">doing sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:31.280" style="s2">flexibility right</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:32.960" style="s2">yeah it sounds a bit like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.280" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">offer</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.960" end="00:59:37.040" style="s2">like to support projects in different</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">ways like i was thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:41.280" style="s2">you know for example if you had you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">projects like reason score and</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.280" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">wikilection</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">and hyper logo so you&#39;re like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">tech they can get fairly large and they</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">can spend quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">a bit of money no problem but then like</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:53.200" style="s2">if you had like an animal sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:55.440" style="s2">well if you give an animal sanctuary you</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.200" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">know 10 million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.440" end="00:59:58.799" style="s2">you can open another animal sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="00:59:59.520" style="s2">maybe like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not quite as</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.799" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">scalable so</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.520" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">it seems like there might be multiple</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.359" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">types where you&#39;re like okay if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what you call it a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:09.520" style="s2">maintenance one you set</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">what your expenses are and then like</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.520" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">okay we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">going to give you much outside of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:15.280" style="s2">so if somebody says i want to give money</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:16.720" style="s2">to animal sanctuaries great</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.280" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">it goes into this pool that gets then</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.720" end="01:00:19.280" style="s2">spread out amongst the different animal</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">sanctuaries</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:22.480" style="s2">where they go through a review to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:23.839" style="s2">okay what are your expenses and how big</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">is it and how many animals and blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:27.680" style="s2">blah</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">try to figure out the best ones and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:34.559" style="s2">in a bit of a different i don&#39;t know any</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.720" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">structure out there like that but so</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.559" end="01:00:38.079" style="s2">that it&#39;s not like okay there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">animal sanctuary that&#39;s just killing it</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.079" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">on patreon and making</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">50 000 a month and then this other one</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s just as big as making ten dollars</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">a month</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">but they&#39;re just maybe not as good at</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:51.200" style="s2">so to hopefully take that part of it out</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.200" end="01:00:52.799" style="s2">and say like if you just want to try to</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.200" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">get maintenance and just try to like</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.799" end="01:00:55.839" style="s2">cover your expenses yeah we can totally</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">help with that we&#39;re not here to make</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.839" end="01:00:58.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">part of like we aren&#39;t here to make</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.079" end="01:01:00.160" style="s2">animal sanctuaries profitable we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.520" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">to you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.160" end="01:01:06.319" style="s2">keep them afloat if that makes sense yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.520" end="01:01:06.319" style="s2">yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.200" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">i think that&#39;s something we do have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.960" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">stop but similar to what you had</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">mentioned that mark</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:16.480" style="s2">likes um like the complexity of it how</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">much is it gonna cost what is it like</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.480" end="01:01:20.559" style="s2">breaking it down to that and you can see</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:22.000" style="s2">if something&#39;s cheap and high impact</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.559" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re starting like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">where the money should go but then</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">there&#39;s also gonna be things that are</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:27.280" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">extremely expensive and high impact</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.280" end="01:01:30.319" style="s2">clearly the highly expensive low</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">impact ones are gonna be the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.319" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">we don&#39;t do for a very long time until</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:36.960" style="s2">they become more impactful right once</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">that niche of people really needs that</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.960" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">once that then it&#39;s going to be and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">possibly makes it cheaper to make it to</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">right with everything else that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:44.480" style="s2">created but</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of options the more we can</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.480" end="01:01:48.079" style="s2">play with them instead of being legit</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:49.680" style="s2">about them and making it be</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.079" end="01:01:51.599" style="s2">one way like when i&#39;m working on the mlm</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">where it&#39;s like five dollars goes to</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.599" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">that structure</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">any like it could be voted out well then</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna break the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">but also if we don&#39;t create something</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:04.880" style="s2">and if people don&#39;t like the idea five</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">dollars is always going towards that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.880" end="01:02:08.799" style="s2">they could just recreate a new one and</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">be like hey actually let&#39;s do like</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.680" style="s2">of the part of it if what we create</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:15.680" style="s2">isn&#39;t good enough</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.680" end="01:02:16.880" style="s2">then anyone can reproduce it and create</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.680" end="01:02:17.920" style="s2">it and tweak it and make it a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.880" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">better it&#39;s just is it just</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.920" end="01:02:20.880" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s just like that one</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:22.960" style="s2">except for these two things so if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:25.839" style="s2">like this better come over here</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">yeah i definitely like that idea of like</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.839" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">if you don&#39;t like it go start your own</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:32.480" style="s2">like this this should need to support</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:32.799" style="s2">the ability of there end up being you</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.480" end="01:02:35.359" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.799" end="01:02:37.520" style="s2">five or ten big versions of these like i</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.359" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">think that&#39;s kind of the ideal world</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.520" end="01:02:41.119" style="s2">where you end up with a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:42.640" style="s2">massive game b corporations</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.119" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">that work together but still kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.640" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">compete but you know like</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:47.839" style="s2">if you lose a million people to go over</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:49.200" style="s2">to one you&#39;re like yeah at least they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.839" end="01:02:51.119" style="s2">still in the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.200" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">that&#39;s why the less rigid we can be</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">if there&#39;s multiple game b corporations</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">actually competing with game a it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:02:58.960" style="s2">going to necessarily be able to get out</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:00.079" style="s2">compete game a but the more that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.960" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">whatever that central</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.079" end="01:03:03.119" style="s2">whatever that thing is that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s necessary to be central</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.119" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">but the more it&#39;s inclusive</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:09.839" style="s2">and can be more generic and can be more</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">something that you can play in</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.839" end="01:03:13.359" style="s2">where you&#39;re not going to be enslaving</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:13.680" style="s2">people and drilling for oil but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.359" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.680" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">anything of anything&#39;s allowable within</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">you know like i can&#39;t say that 25 is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:22.799" style="s2">ethical amount</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">of 50 feet is like there&#39;s you know what</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.799" end="01:03:25.440" style="s2">i mean like you&#39;re playing with numbers</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like there isn&#39;t really a reason to</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.440" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">do one and not the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:29.839" style="s2">that you&#39;re trying different iterations</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">and i lost my train of thought and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.839" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">past the hour anyway</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.440" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">but that is the point because then</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">you&#39;re not competing right this is like</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">right you can you can make a wiki</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">election that competes with wikilection</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">but whatever together tech or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">that entity is that someone else does</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:46.079" style="s2">like there is a point i think where</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:47.520" style="s2">there needs to be one of those because</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.079" end="01:03:47.920" style="s2">it makes it much more efficient to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.520" end="01:03:51.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">oh one place the people are one central</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.200" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">database one thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">i think the market should define that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">right like if a competitor comes out for</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">wiki election and it&#39;s got one percent</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.839" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">yeah you can stay afloat</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:06.400" style="s2">maybe if you have funding issues sorry</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">see you later but if it like comes up</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.400" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s got 20 or 50</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">or 80 market share all right that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">if we&#39;re playing with numbers where</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">where both can stay afloat</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:16.400" style="s2">then there might actually be a need</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:16.799" style="s2">there might be something that one is</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.400" end="01:04:19.119" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.799" end="01:04:20.720" style="s2">different that will never be like if</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">that one drops those people won&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.720" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:25.680" style="s2">and no to the central right whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:27.680" style="s2">thing is that because</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">if there&#39;s if wikilection has to choose</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:31.200" style="s2">between 15 different organizations to</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:32.480" style="s2">decide which one it&#39;s part of or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">part of all of them</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.480" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">you know i mean they were having all of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.839" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">this [ __ ] happen and it&#39;s like not</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">efficient and not it&#39;s like how does</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">that happen with well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">well it&#39;s not as effective globally</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:47.039" style="s2">that&#39;s still pretty efficient</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">maybe maybe not but anyway um we should</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.039" end="01:04:52.000" style="s2">probably end this</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:52.000" style="s2">and see each other on friday for the</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.839" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">remission</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">you</p>
