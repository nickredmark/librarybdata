<p begin="00:00:01.439" end="00:00:05.130" style="s2">that really works in my life the second</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.659" end="00:00:07.890" style="s2">thing that really works in my life is</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.130" end="00:00:10.019" style="s2">cohousing dinners I&#39;ve been involved in</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:13.080" style="s2">this co-hosting project since it first</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:16.049" style="s2">started in Vancouver and I was not able</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.080" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">to financially move in with other people</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.049" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">who bought and are renting there but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">have been welcomed and accepted to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:24.990" style="s2">part of the community dinners so four</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">times a week</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.990" end="00:00:31.140" style="s2">the adults cook and clean there&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">a three to four week cycle so every</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.140" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">adult takes a turn cooking and cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">turn on time period and the kids are</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:41.460" style="s2">getting more involved - acquired - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">more for fun and learning and the amount</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.460" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">of community it&#39;s added the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">eat good nutritious food at a lower cost</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:51.989" style="s2">and more diversity than I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">definitely able to offer my child to not</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.989" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">have to make a meal myself and then have</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">my child rejected have a reject someone</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">else&#39;s food it feels it feels better</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">somehow and yeah it&#39;s just an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">space and just so finding a way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">recreate that for people that don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.420" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">in cohousing I realize the space that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:11.909" style="s2">they&#39;re in is created around that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">they have a community kitchen that seats</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.909" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t know like 40 to 50 people and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">kitchen to cook in together that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:21.990" style="s2">one of their kitchens but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:24.750" style="s2">can recreate it in smaller ways with</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">five neighbors or five households where</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.750" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">each of you are cooking a different</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:29.909" style="s2">night of the week or maybe it&#39;s just fun</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">days and every you know Monday with four</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.909" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">other families just being able to offer</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">that other that community space not</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">having to buy food on our own cooking</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">together eating together is such a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:43.369" style="s2">blessing in my life and loves you able</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">to recreate that on a larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.369" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">larger smaller scale so smaller people</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:50.140" style="s2">with smaller groups of people but more</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">opportunity for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.140" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">that is Apple number 36</p>
