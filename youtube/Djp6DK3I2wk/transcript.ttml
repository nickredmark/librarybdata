<p begin="00:00:00.709" end="00:00:06.210" style="s2">it is 4:00 in the morning and I&#39;m awake</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.510" end="00:00:09.450" style="s2">due to fire alarm malfunction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.210" end="00:00:12.990" style="s2">now solved but Emily it&#39;s been two</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">nights in a row but it is 5:00 and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.990" end="00:00:17.359" style="s2">been awake for over an hour and in less</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:20.210" style="s2">than an hour I have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.359" end="00:00:21.420" style="s2">booked to somebody with their own</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.210" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">world-saving</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">idea I&#39;m looking forward to that but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:28.099" style="s2">was hoping to wake up 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:31.340" style="s2">beforehand not two hours beforehand and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.099" end="00:00:37.380" style="s2">so sitting here with a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.340" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">looking to facilitate a solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.380" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">on my own</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">possibly just because every two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:44.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t often enough for me so just</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:47.070" style="s2">working through it staying for food</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.820" end="00:00:49.100" style="s2">what&#39;s working what&#39;s not working with</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.070" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">the idea what it could look like and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.100" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">then what we could do with 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">and $100,000 and well I was writing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:04.189" style="s2">out the difference between it this</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">difference do the micro and the macro</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.189" end="00:01:10.140" style="s2">that what we&#39;re dealing with in solution</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">raising is like what&#39;s working and not</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">working on scale right so climate change</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:21.570" style="s2">is something that&#39;s not working on scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:23.490" style="s2">because we&#39;re all getting the effects</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">and some people way more effects than</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.490" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">others on that level but the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">that we can&#39;t actually deal with things</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">on the macro level we can only deal with</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">them on the micro level so an economics</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">micro level is individual choices and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">business&#39;s choices and the macro is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">basically government and country&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">choices so it&#39;s like top-down versus</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">bottom-up economics and although my</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:58.439" style="s2">brain and my conscience deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">macro level I care about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.439" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">interconnectedness of the planet and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">people we don&#39;t actually affect things</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">on that scale it has to hit somebody on</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">the micro scale so if you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">about the environment the environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna be a way that you shop</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:17.609" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:20.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t care about the direct impact</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.609" end="00:02:22.590" style="s2">your purchases have on other human</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.639" end="00:02:26.579" style="s2">beings other the animals or the systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.590" end="00:02:27.719" style="s2">as a whole then having that information</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.579" end="00:02:31.739" style="s2">isn&#39;t gonna help you</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.719" end="00:02:33.659" style="s2">but anyway so changing the questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.739" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">from like what is working for us to what</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.659" end="00:02:37.709" style="s2">is working for you what is it working</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:40.230" style="s2">for us to what is it working for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.709" end="00:02:43.739" style="s2">right what in your life how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.230" end="00:02:46.049" style="s2">eating if you were dealing a food or how</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.739" end="00:02:47.129" style="s2">you&#39;re getting your health care what</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.049" end="00:02:49.469" style="s2">does that look like to you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.129" end="00:02:53.480" style="s2">working for you what&#39;s not working for</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.469" end="00:03:01.459" style="s2">you and then what would your ideal</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.480" end="00:03:04.439" style="s2">situation look like in that that one is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.459" end="00:03:06.329" style="s2">someone extrapolating what would work</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.439" end="00:03:08.250" style="s2">for you two what would work for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.329" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">what could a perfect system look like</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.250" end="00:03:12.569" style="s2">like the problem is is when people need</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">when people only deal with the micro</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.569" end="00:03:16.829" style="s2">level like the system can only change at</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:20.790" style="s2">the micro level my brain works at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.829" end="00:03:24.019" style="s2">macro level and the micro level but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.790" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">macro level is where like that is where</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.019" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">utopian ideals want to like settle is on</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">the macro but all it can do is impact</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:38.479" style="s2">the micro just like if and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">I get this on a different level before</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.479" end="00:03:47.359" style="s2">that we can&#39;t change we can&#39;t write laws</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">we can&#39;t decide on new taxation policy</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.359" end="00:03:52.109" style="s2">doing any of that stuff is very arduous</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">what we can do is come up with new</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.109" end="00:03:57.150" style="s2">systems that help people on the micro</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">level have a better impacted macro level</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.150" end="00:04:05.939" style="s2">so if we want the masses to eat in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:07.799" style="s2">environmentally friendly way we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.939" end="00:04:09.209" style="s2">actually design it for the masses and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.799" end="00:04:10.530" style="s2">already knew that we have to design it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.209" end="00:04:12.629" style="s2">for the individual it has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.530" end="00:04:14.189" style="s2">individual who comes and says it needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.629" end="00:04:18.380" style="s2">to be cheap it needs to be convenient it</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.189" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">needs to be within my ethics and values</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.380" end="00:04:23.699" style="s2">instead of here the ethics and values</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">here&#39;s you must eat under this like how</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.699" end="00:04:26.490" style="s2">can we actually help you reach your goal</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.490" end="00:04:33.509" style="s2">meet the mackerel goals on a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">level and the system whatever solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.509" end="00:04:39.419" style="s2">we focus on has to be something that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:40.440" style="s2">a natural attractor to at least the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.419" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">people who created it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.440" end="00:04:48.060" style="s2">but hopefully beyond hopefully you are</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">dealing with the 90% what makes the 90%</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.060" end="00:04:53.699" style="s2">not the fringe 10% that cares deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:56.120" style="s2">about the environmental cost to the nth</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.699" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">degree or the human cost the nth degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.120" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">but because I think every like so my</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:04.500" style="s2">hypothesis is wrong that everyone does</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">care it&#39;s just too overwhelming to care</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.500" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">that if given the choice between slavery</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">and non slavery 99% of individuals would</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">choose non slavery and yet 99% of us</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">choose slavery because it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:21.750" style="s2">overwhelming like where do I get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:24.419" style="s2">computer it&#39;s not dependent on slavery I</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.750" end="00:05:27.509" style="s2">have to not use a computer it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.419" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">work right so like those two things</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.509" end="00:05:33.229" style="s2">don&#39;t actually go together her brains</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:36.389" style="s2">hurt our hearts hurt and I was older but</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.229" end="00:05:38.009" style="s2">anyway up at 4 I am thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.389" end="00:05:40.340" style="s2">difference between the micro and the</p>
