<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">concentrated playing music this is from</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">uh gunter applet great to see you again</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">winter</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">for me to what readily comes to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">it would be most like</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">the moving naiji um the reason i say</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">that is because</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">as i think i&#39;ve mentioned this before</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.640" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">the verb in chinese you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">or practice tai chi it&#39;s the same verb</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">as playing music you play tai chi</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">and so i think that concentrated playing</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">of music would be very very similar</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">uh to the kind of moving mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">practices you see in things</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">like lucuna</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">gaps things that i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">aspect of myself that has been left</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">unaddressed</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.120" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">due to time and fate and negligence on</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">my part</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:36.799" style="s2">is i never developed a music capacity</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">even though i have a great love for</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.799" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">music um</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s statement that life would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">his life would be a mistake without</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">music has always resonated</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">notice the metaphor resonated very</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">deeply with me</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">um so john russon in his book</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">bearing witness to fit uh to epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s and he presents that as sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">of our primary way of being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">bearing witness to epiphany his main</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">claim is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">all of intelligibility all the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">by which we make sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">have a musicality to them the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">they&#39;re patterning</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">and shifting and opening up in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">and part of what it is to be spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">is to wake up to hearing</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">that musicality again and of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">playing actual music</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">and therefore just like doing actual tai</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">chi chuan</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">uh permeates out into the patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">your life and wakes you up</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">and sensitizes you to things and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">part of what&#39;s called ki</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">or chi like that playing music can wake</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">you up</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">and sensitize you to the musicality of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">the presenting of being itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">um and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">that remembering that deep remembering</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">was captured in the old metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">originally the myth</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">of hearing the music of the spheres um</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">i think that&#39;s very very central and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">i i i encourage you to keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">try and make try and make it a resonant</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">bridge try and see how much of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">mindfulness you can bring into the music</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">and then see how much you can let uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:15.120" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the music</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">generalize and permeate into your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">in general to a way of being</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">a way of being with things a deeper kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.799" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">resonance</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">uh dimitar good to see you again does it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">stand to reason that your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">learn from your inner sage goes hand in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">hand with your ability to trust other</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">yes um so our ability</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">and here&#39;s the degree to which you know</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">a pedestal um and you have to be careful</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">as superhuman supernatural the problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">is you sow the seeds</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">of dehumanization if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">internalizing that sage</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">and that sage is not human</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">not fully mortal you are</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">you are sowing the potential seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">uh dehumanization your own</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">i just wanted to say that the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">your question is a deep yes if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">understand the sage</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">as an aspirational kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">self-knowledge is that affords</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">an ability the more you are this is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">matters shows right the more you have a</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">determining and if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">aspirational self then that will afford</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:55.120" style="s2">trust</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">but be careful when the sage is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">a a person you know uh because</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">um there there is a danger</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">this is why christianity always tried to</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">uh so i i related i think this already</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">but i&#39;ll just repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">you know you do this you give a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">a bunch of things a bunch of words to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">remember list of 50 words for example</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:19.120" style="s2">and they they get taught them in room a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">and then you come back after a week and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.120" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">you put right or you&#39;re sorry</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">that&#39;s too long like you wait about an</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">hour you come back</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">and you divide them half of them are in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:30.799" style="s2">room a we divide them randomly half them</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.960" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">are now in roommate and half a room b</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.799" end="00:28:34.960" style="s2">and you ask them to remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">all the words the people in room a will</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.960" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">reliably remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">more of the words than the people in</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">room b because</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">they have not only stored the words they</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">stored the room and when the rooms match</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">they remember more</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">this is why when you&#39;re sad you tend to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">remember many more sad things than happy</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s difficult for you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">sad to remember happy things</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">now what does that translate to</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">so one of the guiding principles of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">practice is that meditation is not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">vacation from your life is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">an education for your life if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">smoking cannabis you&#39;re getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">right and encoding specificity that will</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">not generalize to your</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">life in general very well those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">won&#39;t generalize</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">so generally if you look for example in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">in other wisdom traditions indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">um ethnogens like uh psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">substance psychedelic substances</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">are used sparingly in ritual context to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">try and give people</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">a a a transformative glimpse</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">of what&#39;s possible for them it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">made</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">sort of an everyday practice or thing uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">precisely because it should be used in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">that ritual context</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">and it right uh for such a maybe you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">allow me such exposure</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">uh to an aspirational future whereas</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing your daily practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">you should be trying as much to set up</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">patterns that&#39;s why i emphasize movement</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">and an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">that will generalize to your life in</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">so i hope that&#39;s helpful to you i hope</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">uh dean rouble good to see you again</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">dean</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">is it common to have a burst of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">emotional anxious energy after an</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">and notice what seems an emotional</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">everything you said there is a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">account of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">um generally when i mean you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">of intellectual insights usually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">have that thing but i</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:46.399" style="s2">i get what you&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">dean you&#39;re talking about existential</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.399" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">insights</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">um and so remember that existential</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">insights always will have to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">that rebound effect why</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">because your brain well i don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:02.840" style="s2">with all of the sort of model in</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">cognitive sciences called predictive</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.840" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">processing your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">part of it is because they should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">talking about anticipation not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.279" style="s2">prediction</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">your brain is an anticipation machine</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s always trying to predict the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">and prepare itself that&#39;s what i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">anticipation and do that a highly</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">complex and deeply inter-penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">coupled manner it&#39;s an anticipation</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">machine and so your brain</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">loves familiarity and remember what i</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">talked about including specificity</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not just familiarity out there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:37.279" style="s2">familiarity in here</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">in your processing your brain prefers</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.279" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">familiar unhappiness to surprising</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.640" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">happiness</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:45.679" style="s2">and you go but i like surprise parties</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">yeah but notice how</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.679" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">there you get all the people around you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">who love you it&#39;s in a very safe</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">right there&#39;s cake and there&#39;s good like</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of stuff dude like oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">um so generally when we get an insight</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">an existential insight that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">is going to take us into an unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">world and an unfamiliar sense of self it</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">has that potential</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of it that our brain sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">of goes uh i don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t like that there&#39;s anxiety around</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">lack of familiarity and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">attempt to let&#39;s pull you back</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">let&#39;s pull you back</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.840" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s ultimately part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">the way your brain is adapted because</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">trying to always calibrate between</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">accommodating</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">to what&#39;s the new but also assimilating</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">to what is familiar and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">trying to toggle between them</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">and so that your observations i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">are deeply correct dean</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">okay everyone i think we got to uh some</p>
