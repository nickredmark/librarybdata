<p begin="00:00:40.480" end="00:00:43.840" style="s2">well um okay so i&#39;m just going to read</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.399" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">this out</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.840" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">the narrative practice hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:49.039" style="s2">based on the idea that narrative doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">come naturally to us</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:52.719" style="s2">it&#39;s something that we have to work at</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">but if we have to practice narrative</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">then it is possible that we have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:58.239" style="s2">practicing narrative incorrectly</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">i recall you saying elsewhere that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.239" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">something can&#39;t be a narrative if it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">have something resembling a complete</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:06.080" style="s2">ending but have you ruled out the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">possibility that there it could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">other ways of construing a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">with this in mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">why isn&#39;t dear logos a practicing of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">art of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">yeah so um so when i would i i i</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">i understand your question and i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">the intent is a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:27.680" style="s2">good question um i took</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">narrative to be what uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.680" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">had to have sort of the constituent</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">features that hudo argues are needed in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:37.759" style="s2">order to perform its function</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">um uh so carrick uh you need</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.759" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">you uh you need you need character</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">um you need</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">plot um you need flash forward flashback</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">and you need uh conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">there has to be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">uh a problem that requires you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">at least vicariously plugging into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">distributed cognition within the story</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">in order to uh in order to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:11.840" style="s2">and so i took it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">that um two things</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.840" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">one thing i argued is that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">of narrative as intrinsic to us and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">acknowledged that at least as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">good supposition</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">and that there are states in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">people go uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">trans-narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">i took that i took hudo</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna evoke somebody and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">gonna be talking to him soon so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">this is not just uh promissory uh strong</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna actually be talking to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">james cars i i took narrative uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">at least the way it&#39;s classically</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:50.319" style="s2">understood uh to be something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">um having a resolution um a deniamon the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">climax</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">and all of that etc and therefore to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">an example of what cars calls a finite</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">uh where i took that some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">that are supposed to be happening india</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">and in related um individual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">of self-transcendence as be more</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">an example of what cars calls an</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">infinite game um</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">where you&#39;re not seeking resolution in</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">fact what you&#39;re constantly doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re you&#39;re constantly sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">trying to gradually rewrite and evolve</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">the rules</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">by which the game is played because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">main purpose of the game</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">is to continue and deepen the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">involvement</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">in the playing of the game and i took</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">dialogues to be an example of that so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">that&#39;s what i was thinking that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">interested in hearing your feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">it that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why i made the move i made um</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">obviously i haven&#39;t given you any kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">of a priori closure argument i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">explaining to you my thinking about why</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">i i did it the way i did um what do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">think about that how would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">do that well it just strikes me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">we talk about resolution right um you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:57.599" style="s2">also in your logos talk about getting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">a place where you couldn&#39;t get on your</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">right it seems to me that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">similarity between the resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">getting into</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">getting into that new place yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s not complete or it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">full but</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like an ongoing playing</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">we have this idea of like the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">broke because</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">well at least in part when the final</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">cause was was split off from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">scientific world view then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">right picture of the narrative became uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">nonsensical in in a sort of a sense so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">the question is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">how how do we rebuild it and what i see</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">is rebuilding the narrative yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s narrative it&#39;s or at least</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s trans narrative right</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s you you&#39;re you&#39;re with me and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">acknowledging it&#39;s not traditional or</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">classical narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">right because yeah yeah well you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">pl you&#39;re playing with the narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">well you can&#39;t have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">narrative uh presupposed when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">playing with the narrative definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">right right right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">and the idea it would be more like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">the the old that that that that subgenre</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">that was always sort of questioned by</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">like you you know the the books that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t do them anymore because of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">the internet stuff but i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">they still do them or not i shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">presumptuous</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">you do i you know you you choose your</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">own adventure kind of thing where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">you&#39;re yes yeah right so that the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">the line also between the author and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">reader</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">of the narrative uh is the classic line</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">that the post-modernist makes so much</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">about right</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">is really uh is is undermined</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">significantly</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s also an important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">logos and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">well i was just going to say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">a lot like computer games as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">so i mean that&#39;s also the playing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">narrative and so i see dia logos</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">in that sense also related to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">kind of the because you talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">gaming</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">brings about the flow state right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">yeah so yeah so i i was kind of toying</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">with the idea but</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">because you talk about um well the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">narrative practice hypothesis but then</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">dear logos is the practice of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:04.319" style="s2">narrative it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">it just makes perfect sense to me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.319" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">way somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">yeah i mean one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">i hadn&#39;t thought about it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me to riff on this a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">so this is just on the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">but when i&#39;m doing the work i do on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">philosophy of pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">i talk about a particular pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">style that tries to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">argumentation in the socratic sense not</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">the cartesian sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">argumentation and narrative together and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">yeah i think that that that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">much what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">logos is doing right</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">do more about this i i really like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">idea that this is a way of going sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">trans-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">that allows us to you know exact the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">the narrative function into something</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">that is more consonant</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:50.720" style="s2">uh with our current non-telo</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">non-teleological world view</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.720" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a brilliant insight yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:59.039" style="s2">well i like this i really like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">okay well i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be telling you a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.039" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">lot more about it in the coming weeks or</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">months because this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:05.039" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of on my own just you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">trying to puzzle out so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">uh expect more okay good but like i said</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">if the the last piece i said i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">important to integrate in that you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a pedagogical principle that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">now different than the standard</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">pedagogical principle</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">um well of narrative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">i would say that um the platonic</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">dialogues are very much pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">yes exactly you&#39;re aiming for all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">so that that&#39;s what i see yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">like so a person to take a look at among</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">others is drew hyland</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">because he talks a lot and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">new reading that i&#39;ve been mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">uh he talks a lot about paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">to the drama</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">in addition to the argument and drama is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">a kind of narrative so i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">converging very nicely yeah i i</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">would tend to agree um and also like you</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">know christopher master</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">pietro&#39;s way of trying to like i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">just listening to your uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">podcast about art uh with andrew sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">and like a lot of these issues also</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">tying in there again as well with with</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">art as well and so i think yeah like all</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">coalescing somehow so what about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:18.080" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">straw what about the logos as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.080" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">reinvention of narrative given</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">all the work that uh andrew had yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s good i like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">yeah and then also like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">issues that you&#39;re having with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">jonathan peugeot and stuff that also</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">it helps to build a better platform for</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">communication i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">i i think that&#39;s right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">why i like this that&#39;s why i&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">about it um it might afford more</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">fruitful dialogue between theism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">and non-theism as well yes yes very much</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">so very very much so</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve actually got a lot of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">about that as well i don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">want me to jump in there with that or</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">wait for another question but uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">yeah like you know you do know that i</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t respond to everything but you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">can tell by what i do</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">that i read what you have to say and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">take it into account</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">yeah yeah definitely and yeah so i could</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">also email it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great i&#39;d appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">yeah uh send me that email and i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">i&#39;ll copy chris on it like i&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">looped into it okay okay i&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">because narrative is his sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">narrative and drama are his</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">chosen forms of art that he think are</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">that he thinks are really central</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">to this whole project i i remember um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">the way that he spoke about uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">it was frankenstein with andrew sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">and i was really impressed with this</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">with his uh literally</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">literary analysis so yeah i would really</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a really great idea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">he also did one on both</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">our town uh to play our town it was just</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">amazing</p>

<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">get a situation where i i gave you a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.680" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">chance to explicate it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">which you did and then i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">respond to it in a stepwise fashion i</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">hope you found that helpful</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">yeah that was uh yeah i still need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">find out the answer right because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">you were putting it in the future but</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">yeah thanks that was that was great</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">okay so so my question is when</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">when we are trying to develop like</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">rituals and games and whatever to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">yeah to have a little bit lower barrier</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">of entry right like</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">a more accessible right this is with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">scaling problem of religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">um so i was wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">like paint the space and all the corners</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">that we need to cover</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">in order to have like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">set i guess</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">um so and that&#39;s i i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">totally just put you off again because i</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want you to get the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m going to do with you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:55.760" style="s2">um but i i i i mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">i was just actually talking to mark and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.760" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">brett and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">set up we&#39;re going to set up a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">not this week but next week in which we</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">start the project of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">uh like schematizing that about you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">what are sort of the design principles</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">at the core are setting up</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">an ecology of practices and then uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">and then sort of a a a a pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">like a pedagogical program then my hope</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">from that would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">that once people get a sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">then people would get</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">because human beings tend to do this</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">what if you give them those first two</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">if you give them design functions and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">pedagogical program</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">then they start to be they start to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">good at generating</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">they get a sense of prototypes you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">they get a sort of prototypical sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">what a practice should look like and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">that and that starts to guide them i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">like to do it this way</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">explicitly daniel because um any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s good if rituals emerge to some</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">significant degree</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">bottom up right rather than just trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">to top down construct them</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">so my hope is if we get the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">schematization going</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">the way i&#39;ve just described and people</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">start practicing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">then they will get a clear sense of oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">this is what a good practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">looks like and i i don&#39;t want to give a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">definition for the reasons i just gave</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">so i&#39;m not trying to be quite like i</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">said we&#39;re going to specifically try to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">address this very soon</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:30.639" style="s2">right but my question was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">different though right like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.639" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry maybe i misunderstood you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">please please please restate it then</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">so what i was trying to get at is is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">religio has a certain essence right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">yeah what i what i wanted to hear is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">what would be that essence right like</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">would be like if if you talk to a person</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">on the street like what would you need</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">to offer that person</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:14:00.560" style="s2">in order to say now</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">okay sorry sorry i i completely</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.560" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">misunderstood you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">although i think what i just said was</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">useful uh for the discord server</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">um so for me the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">the the the the the central thing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">what you&#39;re offering people</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">um and you&#39;re offering them and these</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">these two are analytically distinct but</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">they&#39;re in practice they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">conjoined it is you&#39;re asking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">offering people</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">uh systemic systematic and reliable ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">overcoming self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">of enhancing the three</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">axes of connection that we know like</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">are generative of increased meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">life so that the things that undermine</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">meaning in life are of course an</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:46.320" style="s2">undermining of agency that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">self-deceptive thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.320" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">and also people being ignorant about</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">they can enhance the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">connectedness to themselves to each</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">other in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">that sense of being connect of enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">all of these practices bring up the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">in which we are our religion are</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">they bring them up and and enhance them</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">you say that to people they don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.519" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">but if you say to them but the point of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">that the point of enhancing religio is</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">the engine that drives enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">experience not just thought enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">experience enhancement realization</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">of meaning in life then that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">grabs people because people</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">want their lives more meat to be more</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">okay thanks i i think i can work with</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">was that too complex or did you want</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">something even more elevator pitch</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">well uh well i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">looking for for spaces to explore right</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:53.759" style="s2">like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to engage with this design</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.759" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">idea and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to get a map of the territory</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s why i&#39;m asking so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">the main functions that the two</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">so like i said i think the main</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">functions that people generally are</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">looking to being address they need how</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">to be made aware</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">of these functions and like</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">like i said some reliable ways of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">and then</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">or the padgolavada view</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of equivocation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:39.679" style="s2">confusion around this uh what</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">even what the term means what what both</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">entities in this family resemblance</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">like soul and spirit and personality and</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">uh and consciousness many people what</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">one of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">sort of pet peeves is many people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">pronounce uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">know self that all they do is shift all</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">the functions to self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.559" style="s2">and then that doesn&#39;t really really do</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">anything it just</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.559" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">shifts around on the metaphysics without</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">answering anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">uh and other people have made that</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">been a lot of scholastic work</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">around uh the deeper connections between</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">vedanta and buddhism there are many</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">people who are now</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">rather than the sort of traditional</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">and aspects of vedanta um and so</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">um strong was making uh so i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">gonna say uh what was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">maybe what&#39;s a problem when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">meeting making your sense making</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">and using kind of an information</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">processing model</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">uh or a narrative model versus what</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">and then also like how might one use</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">your model in a small world network</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">more than kind of the old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">regular network that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">grew up in it&#39;s good to talk to you rob</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">um yeah i believe i owe you some</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">uh uh emails too so i i they i have not</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">forgotten about them</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">so um i don&#39;t think you&#39;re busy at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:42.240" style="s2">um so i mean what i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">4e cognitive science is basically all</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">around the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">uh the so the standard way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">understanding information processing</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">has been the computational model and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">then that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">and part of the what&#39;s going on is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">that smuggles in an entire cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">and then sort of for heideggerian and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">vickensteinian reasons and beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">that has all come into question and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">the what&#39;s what&#39;s replacing it is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">model now the interesting thing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">um one of the things that alicia gerardo</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">uh the dynamics in action is the book on</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">that that how you sort of shift um</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">into uh using dynamical systems theories</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">to understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">cognition she did explicitly though in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">book and i i mentioned this um</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">she did argue that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">was actually very important um and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">were we had we</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">we missed its functionality from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">standard information processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">precisely and this was really</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">her argument was not the content of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">narrative she was arguing that what</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">narrative does is</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">actually instantiate a like a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">system style of processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">in our our cognition that part of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">of which we can be sort of self-aware</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">because what narrative does</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">is it gets you tracking multiple</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">variables</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">in a self-organizing fashion you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:12.559" style="s2">the you have the foreshadowing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">feedback the layering</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.559" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">um the sensitive dependence on changes</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">in initial conditions</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">you have characters which are soft so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">she gives this whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">very powerful argument uh that why</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">narrative is so important to us but</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">different than the literary style</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">of of narrative because she was</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">not any of the content she was</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">but the basically the pattern i guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">the way of putting it we</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">you actually instantiate uh a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">that enables you to better track</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">and i think that actually is a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">of talking about kudos narrative</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">practice hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">hudo made it sort of very formulaic um</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">although he</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">he later on also comes to reject content</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">models he does that in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">in the work with with maya so i think if</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">what i what i really liked was strong</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.400" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">was was was the shift to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">to right trying to get a focus</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:23.840" style="s2">on what do i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">you sort of the the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.840" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">functionality that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">being instantiated in us in narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.360" style="s2">the actual content of the narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">so this is like what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">lexio</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">and this is like what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">circling where you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">off of the content of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">speaking and the speech is now more</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">directed</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">uh towards you know enabling uh the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.120" style="s2">the dynamical system to get into a flow</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.120" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">within distributed cognition that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.520" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">i see this</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">i mean that that we would start to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">uh we would start to treat narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">something that is much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">about instantiating</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">that right that that flow in distributed</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">uh that gives us you know it gives us a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">transformative space</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">uh rather than just a space in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">um we might be reconceptualizing or even</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">rethinking about how we solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.360" style="s2">which is what</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">sort of standard narrative practice does</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">so the model i&#39;m having in mind when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">answering you rob is when i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">this you know um</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">you know when people are doing jeep form</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.799" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">and they&#39;re sort of enacting</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">drama and they&#39;re trying to deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">bleed between</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">enact it&#39;s like active role playing</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">believe between enacting the drama</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">and the patterns and right within their</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">within their so-called real lives the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:51.600" style="s2">explicit intent of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">narrative drama</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.600" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">is to bleed right between right what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">happening within the drama</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">and what&#39;s happening in their lives and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">so i see that as a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">a very important form of ritualized</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">serious play</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">that is designed to shift the intro</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">shift the focus</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">on to the instantiation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">a dynamical system rather than onto the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">content that we normally focus on when</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">we&#39;re doing narrative</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">i hope that answers your question but</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">is important here sorry john can i just</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">say that&#39;s a follow-up real quick</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">pardon me sir route yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">yes yes so so if in the kind of the old</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">i&#39;m just trying to find good nodes and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">absorb their information or i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">to put out good information</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">like what would i do differently if i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">you what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">like you look for the design principles</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">by which and the type of network that is</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">so the model there is that like like i</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">said this way i&#39;m doing all this work</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">you know the way the the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">keep reconfiguring their social</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">connecting to the right people they pay</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">a lot of attention</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">like they they&#39;re so there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">design on connection and the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">in there because it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.600" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">this thought just occurred to me it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">sounds very much to me like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:01.360" style="s2">taking the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">that you think that narrative is by</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.360" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">default horizontal and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">reappropriate it to make it address the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">vertical</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">yes sound right yes that&#39;s right and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">that goes exactly to the answer to rob</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:17.039" style="s2">because part of that verticality</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">is right is is not i&#39;m not reducing it</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.039" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">to this drum but part of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">verticality</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">is some is is is a mental awareness</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">a sort of metacognitive awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">functionality</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">that rather than it being transparent to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">and so yeah so exactly it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">exception</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.919" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">yes exactly rob does that did that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">answer your follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">yeah this was great that gave me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">of very abstract things to think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">well yeah i get that but the point is um</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">you need to pair that very abstract with</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">the stuff i&#39;m trying to exemplify when</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">i&#39;m doing the deal logos with people</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">yeah i know that part makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">perfectly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">great that was a good uh thanks john i</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.799" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">think that was a good additional</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">follow-up point thank you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">oh my pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">hey ben you have a question for john</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">hi john ben here uh i had a question</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">coming up today</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">in uh in relation to the lesson that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">gave</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">um i was wondering if you see a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">legitimate continuity between uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">this epicurean idea of a joy of being</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">and the jhanas in</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">in buddhism yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">i think so i uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">i mean they come from sort of a a a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">different ontology</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">um and they belong to sort of different</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">pedagogical programs</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">but i think they they might be both</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">instantiating</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">that yeah the i forget the sanskrit term</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">that sense of bliss</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">right it&#39;s the bliss in being yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">analogous but where i see a potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">pedagogical difference so while i agree</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">a convergence in that sense um</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">i i i see the epicurean practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">uh as a a more accessible in</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.240" style="s2">in the issue in the sense that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">been talking about here the scalability</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.240" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">that they&#39;re more off the street</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">accessible to people</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of getting that that tasting</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">of of the bliss of being that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">require</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">you know the the absorption and training</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">that the genos typically require people</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">it definitely seems to be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.399" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">the uh the epicurean practices occur</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">in the context of a householder life</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">rather than in a monastic setting</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">yeah yeah and and like i said one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">and well</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to and i think this is fair</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">to mcclellan because</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">uh i think this is directly his intent</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">but i&#39;m trying to expand on that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">by teaching um the epicurean practices</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">sort of extended epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">that in a way that seeds uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">uh stoicism and seeds neoplatonism so</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">uh in one sense it&#39;ll be standalone</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">accessible this is my attempt to address</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">the scalability problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to get both these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">that&#39;ll be stand-alone accessible</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">but it also will seed people so they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">go to these deeper levels</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:25.679" style="s2">so i am hoping that there can be this uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">synthamata between the traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.679" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">understanding the joy of being in terms</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">of janna&#39;s and the john is in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">the joy of being and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">um and also that continuity between the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:37.840" style="s2">shallow accessible and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">what&#39;s deep totally i mean that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.840" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">the intent</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">i mean the intent of presenting i keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">using this metaphor because it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">keeps coming to mind i i see the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">the eastern and western traditions like</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">the two fields of vision</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">and the point is to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">actually integrate them into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">depth perception</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">how appropriate it would be to go into</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">specifics but uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">this is this is salient to me because</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve been uh studying and practicing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">genres</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">uh recently in uh in my meditations and</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">it seems like there&#39;s a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.079" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">overlap in the material that uh that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">many meditation teachers used</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">pedagogically to to instruct students on</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">these states and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">um the kind of practices that are being</p>

<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">inherent in um in states of mind and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">body that are free from suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:47.839" style="s2">and what not yep i think so i think so</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">the the i i would i would also hope that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.839" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">ben that it would go the other way</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">so i was really impressed by some work</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">that that what would be britain&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:59.440" style="s2">you know that these genres you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">you&#39;re aware of this you know this like</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.440" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">the the the schemas and taxonomies you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">get from the east</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">there isn&#39;t one there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">them and they right</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">right and some are five and some have 27</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">and like</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">like like and so and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">sorry i mean this is a gentle criticism</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">but i&#39;ve encountered it perhaps you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">you get you know you encounter</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:21.520" style="s2">parochialism around this right</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">you encounter people that say well if</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t do 27 you just don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">and it really disheartening to people</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">and i think willingly britain&#39;s point to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">be well there&#39;s no there&#39;s no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">non-parochial justification for any one</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">of these schemas</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">right so if we could get a better</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">discussion going</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">east-west that might help to orient</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">people more towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">you know a convergent functionality</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">rather than a parochial commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">any particular taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">yeah and something that uh that real</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">practice always seems to be pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">assessing things in terms of your own</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">experience and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">yeah getting out of uh yeah dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">adherence to parochial views and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">and whatnot well that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">right so the the idea of trying to set</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">up sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">you know a deal logos between these two</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">is my way of trying to and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s in fact explicitly why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">teaching the true tradition</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s to give people a platform</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">that will afford what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">afford them actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">shifting uh towards that uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">trans-parochial kind of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">to the practice so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">definitely uh something something very</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">salient to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">um because of my background and uh so</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">i&#39;ll be trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">on that and uh and with this community</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">as as we go on</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">excellent i mean one of the great things</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">um that makes me i&#39;m sorry it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">sorry don&#39;t take it that i&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">my pleasure about things</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">matters or is normative but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">things that is pleasing me</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">is how so many people are being drawn to</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">feeling honestly a little struggled</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">in even asking it um</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">and please please i i don&#39;t even know if</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">it should even be</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">bothered because it seems like it would</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">involve a</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">kind of much deeper discussion that i</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to take away from others and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">asking their questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">um but the question is it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">sound probably relatively simple but</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">it&#39;s for a much broader</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:26.079" style="s2">question going on in my head that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">curious about</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">there and i&#39;m not meaning to force it or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">and like i said to take up anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">time um but basically the question is um</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m wondering if you could speak on</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">the current state of cognitive research</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">not even necessarily cognitive research</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">but just any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">consciousness research or neuro you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">consciousness the general frame of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">and as it relates towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">evolution and how is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">is it appearing as though the research</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">is moving in a direction</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">of that there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">signs or there aren&#39;t as many signs</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">that we we are having this desire to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">craft religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">and and particularly so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">is</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">and the way that we we have this what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">appearing to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">and like i said i don&#39;t have the science</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">behind this at all but it appears to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">as being there&#39;s this innate desire</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">on on our part to craft religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">and praxis in particular and that if</p>

<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">which we are pointing this toward</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">in the case of like you know um</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">the mysterium in the sense of like any</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">type of religious tradition and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:01.839" style="s2">that if that&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">it still has this desire to flow itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.720" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">out into praxis</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">and we can see this in varieties of</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question and you&#39;re right</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">i i like it it&#39;s a deep answer but uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">my answer to that is going to start</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">coming out next week or the week after</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">so i have</p>

<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">because greg and i have written</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">why do we need to bring into it um the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">relationship to the problem of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">meaning meaning in life not semantic</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:11.800" style="s2">meaning and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">we are doing that and so it&#39;s a sequence</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.800" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">of sort of hour and 15 minute</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">conversations between he and i genuine</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">i come at it of course from sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">angle of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">philosophy and kagsai</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">and while greg is very philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">literate he comes at it from his</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">uh as a psychologist and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.800" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">um and so we are directly addressing</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2">um and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">like i said um we&#39;ve recorded four</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">already and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">that&#39;s only about uh we&#39;re only about a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">third of the way through the argument</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">so i suspect it&#39;s going to be a a total</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:58.640" style="s2">of uh of 12</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:43:00.560" style="s2">uh video uh recordings of greg and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.640" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">exploring exactly these connections that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.560" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">so yes very much so</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">and what what we&#39;re both trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">with our</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:14.880" style="s2">uh with our respective uh expertise is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">to bring together and condense as much</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.880" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">of the current uh cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">psychology and neuroscience etc but also</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">people talking about transformations of</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">consciousness and transformations of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:28.240" style="s2">self-consciousness that&#39;s the overlap</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.240" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">therapy and and mystical experiences</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:34.720" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to bring all of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">together and put it into an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.720" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">presentation</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">and like i said we&#39;ve we&#39;ve recorded</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">four of those</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">hello john of course i have a question</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:50.240" style="s2">um i&#39;ve i&#39;ve been you know we had peter</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">lindbergh here and he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.240" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">the mean plex</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">which is a term i despise um</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">and so we actually we we renamed it</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">because we can do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">um and and so like one of his concerns</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">you know sort of like when you&#39;re out in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">the meanplex it&#39;s too easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">for your message to get either lost or</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:14.640" style="s2">manipulated or</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">something like that um and then so</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:19.520" style="s2">i i like i said we we sort of have this</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">reformulation of the memplex</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">uh that were that were um</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">you know that basically we&#39;re using to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">out compete memes</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">in some sense right and we&#39;re calling it</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">the realm of transformative coupling</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">and imagining is something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">well memes are these very low-res icons</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">attachments or something that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">really symbols they aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">they aren&#39;t really parables and so i i</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">i was wondering if if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">in that space</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">and this is sort of to manuel&#39;s point i</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">guess in some way right</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">where where you know the available</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">cogsi and and you know all of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">available knowledge you bring to bear on</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">in terms of ecology of practices if</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a an easy way</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">sort of into that space of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">transformative coupling</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">you know through symbols or like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">what the history tells us about symbols</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">that are accessible to people and how we</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">involve them and therefore compete in</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">the mean plex</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:26.480" style="s2">as it were with better with better tools</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">and what your thoughts were around that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">so yeah i think that&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">question and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">have the relative expertise in that but</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">i had i was fortunate um and i did uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">mention it to you guys what what needs</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">to be created are</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">are basically new genres uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:47.520" style="s2">and so i i this is not meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">exhaustive mark it&#39;s meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.520" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">exemplary</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:53.599" style="s2">i i i think what akira the dawn did</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">uh with the meaning wave i i think this</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.599" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">is a powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">uh because beca right because he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">breaking genres</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">he&#39;s creating a new genre he&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:04.880" style="s2">something that looks like a meme</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">or it looks like a jingle but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.880" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">actually not right</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s designed to basically draw people</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">in and draw them into a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">not so what it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">a parable</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:19.359" style="s2">undermines standard narrative it looks</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">like a meme and it draws people in but</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.359" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s actually designed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">to my mind and this is what i came</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">across in the discussion with him</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">it&#39;s actually designed to uh undermine</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">the stance that people take when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">consuming memes</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">and actually draw them into a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.839" end="00:49:35.119" style="s2">engagement i like what you called it</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">right what did you call it some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.119" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">coupling what was the name again</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">the realm of transformative coupling</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">transformative coupling and so what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">trying to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">with the with the meaning wave right is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">something that&#39;s seductive in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">that it looks like a meme</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">or it&#39;s like or like it&#39;s seductive like</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">a parable</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">it looks like a meme it draws you in and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.640" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">then it explodes the very</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">consumerist um you know uh superficial</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">salience attitude</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">that drives the mean plex and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:11.040" style="s2">undermines it by getting people</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">it basically ushers them into um</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">that kind of transformative coupling i</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">don&#39;t have the skill to do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">um that i i just i don&#39;t but why</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">i wanted why i was so interested in</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">what he was doing and talking to him is</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">like again i&#39;m not saying that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">again i want to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not exhaustive but it&#39;s exemplary</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">of the kind of thing that is needed</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the kind of thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">needed i can&#39;t generate that</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t have the skills i don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">expertise but people who do</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">like him i think need to generate things</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">of that ilk</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that yeah we&#39;re certainly on</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">the same page on that so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">i guess as a hopefully quick follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">although probably not um</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:50:57.359" style="s2">i i&#39;m you know i i hear you talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.319" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">about uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.359" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">uh stealing the culture and uh right</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">so what what happened say during the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">last time the culture got stolen</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">you know that that that we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">um you know to to to utilize i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">know one thing that uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">somebody who comes on here occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">mentioned was um</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">uh uh the whole idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">the french revolution was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">spawned off by art for example</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">right so that that sort of you know any</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:30.400" style="s2">any handles</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:32.240" style="s2">uh that we have into that and then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.400" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">hopefully we&#39;ll get the artists right or</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.240" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">we have availability to the artists to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">do the work once with it once we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">schematize it for them to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">right and then what was also needed</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">what&#39;s also needed</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">um so the example that comes to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">you know the one that i tend to use is</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">you know how christianity stole the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">culture of the roman empire</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">and you have you you have to well part</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">of what the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s happening here uh you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:01.119" style="s2">have to build</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:02.400" style="s2">communities but you also have to network</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.119" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">communities together</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.400" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">um that&#39;s why the thing that rafe kelly</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">did a couple weeks ago the movement</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">summit</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">where you have all these emerging uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">communities of practice</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">and and and their attendant research and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">they all</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">we were getting together and and there</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">was this very rich exchange</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t any attempt to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">nobody was saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">my way is the way or my community is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">it was this attitude of no let&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">find a way</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">to network together because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:35.040" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got what the christians did</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.040" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">was they you know they set up all these</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">uh churches but they also had mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">informal mechanisms almost shamanistic</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">where people are constantly moving</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">between the churches either literally by</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">journeying</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:51.520" style="s2">or by letters and what you have for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">very long time is you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.520" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t have the hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">structure that became the catholic</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:59.920" style="s2">you had instead this this this co-op</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">that was constantly redesigning and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.920" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">redefining itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:06.000" style="s2">and i i think that&#39;s also something we</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:07.359" style="s2">like it&#39;s not just a matter of how we</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.000" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">present the material</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">it&#39;s also important to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">we grow</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:15.359" style="s2">the culture how we like how how we and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">mean literally</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.359" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">how do we afford what i was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">rob about</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:22.400" style="s2">you know how do we afford the formation</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">of dynamically continually redestruct</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">restructuring and redefining</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">small world network of these emerging</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">communities of practice i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">important problem and again this is part</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">of why i&#39;m talking to jordan hall so</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">much i don&#39;t have the relevant expertise</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.960" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">because i want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">possible ways in which human beings can</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">make these kinds of dynamical</p>
