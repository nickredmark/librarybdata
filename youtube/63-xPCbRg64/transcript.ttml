<p begin="00:00:00.800" end="00:00:05.730" style="s2">almost hijacked the last one with a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.540" end="00:00:07.290" style="s2">idea so I wanted to record it here with</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.730" end="00:00:08.700" style="s2">the everything library I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.290" end="00:00:11.519" style="s2">how there&#39;s two libraries in different</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.700" end="00:00:13.080" style="s2">cities and I&#39;m often inspired by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.519" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">ideas that have an accessory in like</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.080" end="00:00:16.500" style="s2">Portland in Seattle I&#39;m going to write</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:19.770" style="s2">here about an idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">and we like to see it here I just think</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.770" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">it&#39;s less efficient for everyone to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">to start from zero so if all of the two</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">libraries around the world could</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:29.220" style="s2">coordinate find out what works and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:30.779" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and use databases that one</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.220" end="00:00:32.430" style="s2">of them created so that they can all use</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.779" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">it and so coordination between</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.430" end="00:00:37.829" style="s2">nonprofits for solutions that work one</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:39.030" style="s2">of the other solutions we have here</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.829" end="00:00:41.760" style="s2">which is amazing and I&#39;ve definitely</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.030" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">utilized is quest which is a non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">grocery store so a lot of the food that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">would go to waste because it&#39;s close to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">the expiry date or about to go off in</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:56.039" style="s2">case of produce and dairy and eggs and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">such is donated and then it&#39;s sold at a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.039" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">very low cost to people who have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">referral to shop there so it is a step</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">up or step sideways or whatever from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">food bank or you&#39;re given food for free</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">but you have no autonomy on what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">really given and quest you can go to and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:19.220" style="s2">shop for your own food a lot of it here</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:22.350" style="s2">because of our local grocery shops is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.220" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2">is organic produce that&#39;s you have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.350" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">use in the next couple days but to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:29.700" style="s2">able to help other cities start</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:33.180" style="s2">something like that easily would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:34.700" style="s2">amazing if quest could could put that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.700" end="00:01:38.189" style="s2">the programs do we have no other</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">programs I can&#39;t think of any here at</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.189" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">this exact moment time that come into</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">mind but when one city comes up with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">solution being able to roll that out in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">other cities more easily by building on</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">what has already been done and not</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">reinventing the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:02:02.360" style="s2">so non-profit and solution corporation</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:02.360" style="s2">knowledge share that is Apple 39</p>
