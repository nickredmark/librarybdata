<p begin="00:00:05.690" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">so we record an interview that went</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.950" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">partly into the glitch in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:15.299" style="s2">film and it was shared like a few people</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:16.550" style="s2">took clips for it and it was widely</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.299" end="00:00:19.680" style="s2">shared I think one of them got about</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.550" end="00:00:22.039" style="s2">250,000 views in total probably about</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.680" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">half a million people saw that interview</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.039" end="00:00:33.649" style="s2">and what we talked about a lot was the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:35.809" style="s2">female shadow and the idea that what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.649" end="00:00:38.190" style="s2">we&#39;re living in a culture that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.809" end="00:00:41.000" style="s2">especially with me too has got a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.190" end="00:00:43.290" style="s2">real exposure of the male shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.000" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">these sort of ways that men have acted</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.290" end="00:00:50.309" style="s2">out and but and this kind of ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">narrative of toxic masculinity but we</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:54.809" style="s2">have no no one talks about toxic</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:57.030" style="s2">femininity and how to really unbalance</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.809" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">conversation did what were those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.030" end="00:01:02.370" style="s2">responses that you got to that so I got</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">a lot of responses from men around the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.370" end="00:01:07.560" style="s2">world really thanking me for speaking up</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:09.150" style="s2">from for saying something that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">don&#39;t feel that they could speak and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.150" end="00:01:13.979" style="s2">they haven&#39;t heard other women say so</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">they really thank me for bringing a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.979" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">voice to something that&#39;s there but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">not spoken about there&#39;s no permission</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:23.009" style="s2">to speak about these things and I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">also women messaging me to say thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.009" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">for showing up in this way thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">showing womanhood so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">about a way in a conversation that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:37.009" style="s2">haven&#39;t brought into the picture that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:40.020" style="s2">that somehow resonated with many people</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.009" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">and also I know that there were some</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.020" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">people who thought that you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:46.500" style="s2">speaking from a position of internalized</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">misogyny of course let&#39;s you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.500" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">the first thing that people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">question where&#39;s this woman come coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">from because she&#39;s saying something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to say and of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">I had a lot of self-reflection about is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">that true or not and of course that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">I grew up in a patriarchal society I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">grew up with these with these values I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:09.629" style="s2">grew up feeling as a girl and as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.630" style="s2">that my voice was not was not as</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.629" end="00:02:14.660" style="s2">important and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.630" end="00:02:16.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s worth listening to so I had to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.660" end="00:02:20.210" style="s2">think about has I&#39;ve been internalized</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.520" end="00:02:23.990" style="s2">in me and I would say yes and no but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.210" end="00:02:27.050" style="s2">know very well how it is to be a woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.990" end="00:02:29.810" style="s2">and I know how it is to be a woman in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.050" end="00:02:31.640" style="s2">public space so the place that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.810" end="00:02:33.740" style="s2">coming from is really from from an</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.640" end="00:02:36.680" style="s2">experience of being a woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.740" end="00:02:39.590" style="s2">and also being in a deep relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.680" end="00:02:42.530" style="s2">with a man that teaches me about how is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.590" end="00:02:44.810" style="s2">it to be a man and as a mother of two</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.530" end="00:02:47.450" style="s2">young men as well that are developing</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.810" end="00:02:50.420" style="s2">their masculinity in contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.450" end="00:02:52.130" style="s2">society that teaches me a lot and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.420" end="00:02:54.740" style="s2">a place that I&#39;m speaking from it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.130" end="00:02:57.530" style="s2">really from this embodied experience of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.740" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">being a woman right now this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.530" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">wanted to to say about the me to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:05.990" style="s2">movement that yes it has exposed male</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:09.370" style="s2">shadows but it has definitely also</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.990" end="00:03:11.930" style="s2">exposed female shadows this blind</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.370" end="00:03:14.660" style="s2">aggression the blind projections that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.930" end="00:03:16.340" style="s2">are going on towards men and this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.660" end="00:03:18.739" style="s2">what this is what we&#39;re not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.340" end="00:03:22.070" style="s2">talk about and this is what is important</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.739" end="00:03:25.070" style="s2">for women to really look at and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.070" end="00:03:28.610" style="s2">really have a sane self-reflection about</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.070" end="00:03:30.830" style="s2">how are we actually trying to create the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.610" end="00:03:32.600" style="s2">space that we&#39;re missing are we trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.830" end="00:03:34.100" style="s2">to create it from the place of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.600" end="00:03:36.170" style="s2">shadow that we are taking we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.100" end="00:03:39.400" style="s2">becoming the perpetrators ourselves our</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.170" end="00:03:41.660" style="s2">aggressive and on reflected voices and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.400" end="00:03:44.260" style="s2">these are attacking people by playing</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.660" end="00:03:46.850" style="s2">the victim attacking men basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.260" end="00:03:48.170" style="s2">attacking men for being the perpetrators</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.850" end="00:03:50.660" style="s2">but in a way with that we do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.170" end="00:03:54.170" style="s2">ourselves instead of taking the space</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.660" end="00:03:56.450" style="s2">and filling it with what is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.170" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">to be a woman this is really this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.450" end="00:04:01.910" style="s2">missing what is being exposed now that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:04.780" style="s2">being a woman is that we have so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.910" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">power and we are going to use it quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.780" end="00:04:09.290" style="s2">irresponsibly this is what I see with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">me-too movement that it&#39;s gone too far</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.290" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like we are we&#39;re becoming</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.350" end="00:04:21.810" style="s2">increasing okay women sisters what do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.350" end="00:04:23.540" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">with this space that we have created</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.540" end="00:04:31.860" style="s2">because I guess what we&#39;re saying is yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:33.570" style="s2">me too exposed male shadows but we all</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.860" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">have shadows women have shadows just as</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.570" end="00:04:37.950" style="s2">men have shadows and they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:41.730" style="s2">different and also there&#39;s some sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.950" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">like Harvey Weinstein is now facing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.730" end="00:04:45.630" style="s2">been charged with rape he&#39;s facing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:46.950" style="s2">long time in jail potentially so for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.630" end="00:04:51.150" style="s2">long time there&#39;s this kind of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.950" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">of well the patriarchy Harvey Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.150" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">was facilitated by the patriarchy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:57.390" style="s2">like well that same patriarchy the legal</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:04:59.850" style="s2">system the structures that we&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.390" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">in society has now held him accountable</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.850" end="00:05:04.050" style="s2">and it looks like he&#39;s probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:07.669" style="s2">go to jail and actually I would argue if</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.050" end="00:05:11.100" style="s2">if people both men and women within</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.669" end="00:05:13.979" style="s2">within his circles had spoken up earlier</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.100" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">and taken moral responsibility rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.979" end="00:05:18.870" style="s2">than accepting payoffs and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:20.190" style="s2">kind of and actually stood up and said</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.870" end="00:05:22.919" style="s2">something we wouldn&#39;t be in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.190" end="00:05:24.450" style="s2">situation now so you could say oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.919" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">well it&#39;s a corrupt system I&#39;d agree but</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.450" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">it was only corrupt because the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:31.350" style="s2">in it were corrupt the actual system</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">itself when people spoke up is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.350" end="00:05:34.710" style="s2">functioning as it should the justice</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:38.700" style="s2">system is functioning as it should and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.710" end="00:05:41.130" style="s2">this I think could perhaps for me at</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.700" end="00:05:43.950" style="s2">least were kind of before or after</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.130" end="00:05:46.380" style="s2">moment because for a long time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.950" end="00:05:47.789" style="s2">been this sort of sense of and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.380" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve active heard people say this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.789" end="00:05:53.190" style="s2">like men now it&#39;s not your time to speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:54.810" style="s2">you just have to listen and I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.190" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2">understand that and I have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:05:58.200" style="s2">listening to a lot of the stories that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.060" end="00:06:00.120" style="s2">have come out and a lot of them are</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.200" end="00:06:02.700" style="s2">horrific and it&#39;s like a real point of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.120" end="00:06:04.650" style="s2">kind of reflection but it can&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.700" end="00:06:07.020" style="s2">there because if it&#39;s just one person</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.650" end="00:06:08.900" style="s2">speaking another person listening by</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.020" end="00:06:12.180" style="s2">definition that&#39;s not a relationship a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.900" end="00:06:14.520" style="s2">relationship by definition is you speak</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.180" end="00:06:17.669" style="s2">I listen I speak you listen if if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.520" end="00:06:20.010" style="s2">not then it&#39;s it&#39;s not a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.669" end="00:06:22.229" style="s2">it&#39;s a master/slave dynamic or it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.010" end="00:06:24.510" style="s2">power dispute or it&#39;s a dominance</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.229" end="00:06:26.700" style="s2">hierarchy game it&#39;s not a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.510" end="00:06:29.729" style="s2">so the relationship that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.700" end="00:06:34.110" style="s2">it seems is yes for men to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.729" end="00:06:34.770" style="s2">women&#39;s experience but women also have</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.110" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">to listen to men</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.770" end="00:06:40.139" style="s2">experience as well and then we could see</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:44.449" style="s2">sort of some progress in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.139" end="00:06:47.129" style="s2">discussion beyond just the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.449" end="00:06:49.650" style="s2">the victim perpetrator dynamic that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.129" end="00:06:51.330" style="s2">seem to be being pulled into yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.650" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">is the thing that I I feel is the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.330" end="00:06:56.520" style="s2">important about the meter movement is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:59.159" style="s2">that it was somehow doomed to happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.520" end="00:07:00.539" style="s2">this lid needed to explode or this</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.159" end="00:07:03.000" style="s2">container needed to explode because</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.539" end="00:07:05.400" style="s2">women couldn&#39;t contain it anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.000" end="00:07:08.370" style="s2">it&#39;s coming out so let&#39;s say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.400" end="00:07:10.710" style="s2">initiation of a conversation but then it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.370" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">started running a bit amok because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:17.069" style="s2">not a conversation it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:19.889" style="s2">getting out the rage which is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.069" end="00:07:22.229" style="s2">understandable and very needed but then</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.889" end="00:07:25.229" style="s2">is a question what are we going to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.229" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">with this how we going to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.229" end="00:07:29.430" style="s2">about the things that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:31.889" style="s2">experienced and the place that we want</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.430" end="00:07:34.409" style="s2">to take in society the power that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.889" end="00:07:36.050" style="s2">want to have the disempowerment we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.409" end="00:07:38.099" style="s2">want to feel anymore</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.050" end="00:07:39.719" style="s2">how are we going to bring that to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.099" end="00:07:42.270" style="s2">world and the way that it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.719" end="00:07:44.009" style="s2">happening is not that it&#39;s a chaotic way</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.270" end="00:07:47.069" style="s2">it&#39;s a blame way it&#39;s a female shadow</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.009" end="00:07:51.029" style="s2">coming up and I&#39;m I&#39;m really really</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.069" end="00:07:54.630" style="s2">interested in women showing up with men</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.029" end="00:07:57.270" style="s2">in connection to say what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.630" end="00:07:59.789" style="s2">wrong for you what&#39;s going on wrong for</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.270" end="00:08:01.770" style="s2">me it&#39;s a self-reflection that really</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.789" end="00:08:04.139" style="s2">really needs to happen that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.770" end="00:08:06.630" style="s2">seen yet I&#39;ve seen like the explosion</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.139" end="00:08:08.729" style="s2">that creates a space but there&#39;s a next</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.630" end="00:08:10.650" style="s2">phase is to fill it with the content and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.729" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">men and women need to do that in</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.650" end="00:08:14.819" style="s2">dialogue and in respect for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">differences which is also what&#39;s lacking</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.819" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">there&#39;s men there&#39;s women</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">there&#39;s masculine that&#39;s feminine</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:24.210" style="s2">there&#39;s male as female all these things</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:27.449" style="s2">what does that mean it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:29.219" style="s2">there is a difference and what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.449" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">in that space this is what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.219" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">interested in what do we do in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:36.089" style="s2">space I mean we are if you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">this and you live in London or you live</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.089" end="00:08:40.469" style="s2">in the UK we&#39;re doing an event on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:42.870" style="s2">5th of June to try and model these</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.469" end="00:08:44.310" style="s2">conversations and try and bring it to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.870" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">that next level coz I think I think it</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:46.940" style="s2">has to happen in person</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:49.010" style="s2">I think these only things can only have</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.940" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">in person I want to add to that that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.010" end="00:08:52.730" style="s2">is a thing that always needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:54.500" style="s2">in person because we can sit there and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.730" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">we can have intellectual discussions</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.500" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">about men and women our position in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:01.400" style="s2">society and everything but when we walk</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:03.170" style="s2">down of the room and we go out there we</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.400" end="00:09:05.690" style="s2">go back to our partners and our life</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.170" end="00:09:07.630" style="s2">that&#39;s where it&#39;s really happening it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.690" end="00:09:10.700" style="s2">really happening at the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.630" end="00:09:13.730" style="s2">experience a level and that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.700" end="00:09:16.430" style="s2">can learn so much about how am I in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.730" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">connection how am I in relationship how</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.430" end="00:09:21.380" style="s2">am i playing out these shadows here now</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">and we really forget about it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.380" end="00:09:25.970" style="s2">why that&#39;s a micro level where the real</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:28.510" style="s2">learning is so that we can change</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.970" end="00:09:30.770" style="s2">society at the macro level yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.510" end="00:09:33.740" style="s2">what it feels like is happening I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.770" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">what he was happening is men and women</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.740" end="00:09:37.660" style="s2">in this sort of dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:40.400" style="s2">relationship is I think one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.660" end="00:09:41.780" style="s2">the key drivers of what we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.400" end="00:09:43.820" style="s2">the political realm what we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.780" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">a cultural realm at the moment which has</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.820" end="00:09:47.690" style="s2">risen with sort of women&#39;s position in</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.450" style="s2">the world at post-1960</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.690" end="00:09:52.430" style="s2">as many women are sharing space more and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.450" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">more which is an essential development</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.430" end="00:09:56.540" style="s2">but also there are these difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">about navigating kind of men&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.540" end="00:10:00.520" style="s2">women&#39;s different experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:04.070" style="s2">world one thing I also want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.520" end="00:10:05.770" style="s2">and this apparently was not acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.070" end="00:10:08.690" style="s2">but you weren&#39;t allowed to say this but</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.770" end="00:10:11.660" style="s2">myself and most of the guys that I know</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.690" end="00:10:13.520" style="s2">our issue we weren&#39;t raised by the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.660" end="00:10:16.780" style="s2">people who are raising Harvey Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.520" end="00:10:19.820" style="s2">and that sort of older generation of men</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.780" end="00:10:21.350" style="s2">mark our issues I can speak for myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.820" end="00:10:25.340" style="s2">and speak for a lot of the guys that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.350" end="00:10:28.960" style="s2">know were not kind of internalizing rape</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.340" end="00:10:33.140" style="s2">culture and abuse it was far more about</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.960" end="00:10:36.170" style="s2">castration like we were castration in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.140" end="00:10:38.600" style="s2">our in our families and castration in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.170" end="00:10:41.450" style="s2">wider culture and what I mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.600" end="00:10:43.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not okay you&#39;re competitive drives</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.450" end="00:10:45.500" style="s2">are not okay your aggression is not okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.490" end="00:10:47.660" style="s2">all of these sort of aspects of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.500" end="00:10:49.339" style="s2">that we as men have more of with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.660" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">sort of testosterone and our biological</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.339" end="00:10:55.070" style="s2">existence and I&#39;m not okay and then it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:58.440" style="s2">sort of no this is toxic masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.070" end="00:11:01.140" style="s2">I teach men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.440" end="00:11:02.760" style="s2">groups and the number of men who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.140" end="00:11:07.380" style="s2">internalized a sense of shame around</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.760" end="00:11:09.300" style="s2">themselves as men is huge and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.380" end="00:11:11.070" style="s2">the dynamic now and at the moment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.300" end="00:11:12.990" style="s2">having this sort of reaction against an</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.070" end="00:11:15.180" style="s2">old dynamic with Harvey Weinstein and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.990" end="00:11:18.180" style="s2">people who are raised by sort of 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.180" end="00:11:22.980" style="s2">1960s parents who that probably was more</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.180" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">kind of internalized misogyny in those</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.980" end="00:11:27.030" style="s2">areas I think what we&#39;re seeing now is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">much more complex picture and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.030" end="00:11:34.410" style="s2">generally sort of a castration that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:36.210" style="s2">either comes from the family or comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.410" end="00:11:38.310" style="s2">from kind of our dynamics or comes from</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.210" end="00:11:40.650" style="s2">the culture where it&#39;s this this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.310" end="00:11:42.150" style="s2">masculinity is being shamed and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.650" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">a completely different dynamic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.150" end="00:11:48.600" style="s2">one that&#39;s I think added to by the me2</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:51.540" style="s2">or some of the me2 movement which when</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.600" end="00:11:53.280" style="s2">meet who says men are you the only</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.540" end="00:11:55.410" style="s2">appropriate response now is to shut up</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.280" end="00:11:58.050" style="s2">and listen and to feel guilty for</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.410" end="00:12:00.570" style="s2">yourself and food and it&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.050" end="00:12:02.550" style="s2">some truth in yeah we as men need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.570" end="00:12:04.650" style="s2">hold our brothers accountable and hold</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.550" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">ourselves accountable in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.650" end="00:12:08.670" style="s2">that we all need to hold each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.080" style="s2">accountable but to kind of internalized</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.670" end="00:12:14.310" style="s2">that there&#39;s something faulty about you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.080" end="00:12:17.400" style="s2">as a man is it&#39;s really is a really</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.310" end="00:12:20.490" style="s2">dangerous thing to give to someone so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.400" end="00:12:22.950" style="s2">when you mention castration I absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.490" end="00:12:26.310" style="s2">agree that this is happening at so many</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.950" end="00:12:28.680" style="s2">levels in in society right now and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.310" end="00:12:31.890" style="s2">the values in the institutions and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.680" end="00:12:34.860" style="s2">feel it&#39;s somehow it&#39;s a movement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.890" end="00:12:37.500" style="s2">it&#39;s the evolution from the modernist to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.860" end="00:12:40.860" style="s2">the post modernist set of values of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.500" end="00:12:43.830" style="s2">mindset paradigm that we moved from a</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.830" end="00:12:47.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work anymore we need to we</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.630" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">really need to question everything and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.640" end="00:12:51.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve done that we&#39;ve ended up in the</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.750" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">the thing is that with that with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.380" end="00:13:03.480" style="s2">destruction of the patriarchy has come</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.110" end="00:13:15.110" style="s2">essentially feminine but this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.199" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">fascinating because the the dialogue</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:24.319" style="s2">true there&#39;s a kind of as a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.470" end="00:13:32.269" style="s2">still patriarchal when is actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.870" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">pretty feminized you look at kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.269" end="00:13:35.629" style="s2">masculine values and the way boys are</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.069" style="s2">treated in school and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.629" end="00:13:39.589" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of natural exuberance is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.069" end="00:13:40.970" style="s2">now being seen as toxic we are living in</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.589" end="00:13:42.589" style="s2">a feminized society that&#39;s pretending</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.589" end="00:13:50.149" style="s2">no no it&#39;s still patriarchal and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.399" end="00:13:52.370" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of this very trip difficult</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.149" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">sort of perspective to hold at the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.370" end="00:13:57.189" style="s2">time I think it&#39;s a natural place that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:14:02.420" style="s2">we need need to move through it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.189" end="00:14:06.350" style="s2">patriarchal masculinity is moved into we</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.420" end="00:14:08.769" style="s2">need to we need to rebel against that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.350" end="00:14:14.120" style="s2">it&#39;s post-modernism that that says</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.769" end="00:14:16.610" style="s2">everything is has is inherently the same</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.120" end="00:14:18.829" style="s2">there is no difference and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.610" end="00:14:21.800" style="s2">treat boys and girls like the same and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.829" end="00:14:25.129" style="s2">you know I see this happening and even</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.800" end="00:14:27.860" style="s2">the micro level of of schools and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.129" end="00:14:30.559" style="s2">know institutions but the thing is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.860" end="00:14:32.839" style="s2">a feminine way of thinking that we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.559" end="00:14:35.540" style="s2">all the same it&#39;s community it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.839" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">caring caring for the whole and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:41.720" style="s2">expensive it&#39;s an important it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:44.600" style="s2">important perspective we need to include</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.720" end="00:14:47.689" style="s2">it and transcend this transcend and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.600" end="00:14:49.850" style="s2">include is so essential if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.689" end="00:14:51.949" style="s2">move forward in cult if we really want</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.850" end="00:14:55.100" style="s2">to think in an evolutionary way and say</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.949" end="00:14:57.230" style="s2">yes we&#39;ve feminized our Institute our</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.100" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">institutions we&#39;ve feminized our values</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.230" end="00:15:01.879" style="s2">but we are throwing out the baby with</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:03.529" style="s2">the bathwater and this is where a person</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.879" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">like Jordan Peterson comes on this on</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.529" end="00:15:07.189" style="s2">the scene and says there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:09.889" style="s2">wrong here something is missing he</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.189" end="00:15:12.589" style="s2">becomes a very very important voice</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.889" end="00:15:15.709" style="s2">that&#39;s a result of that feminization is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.589" end="00:15:17.990" style="s2">the way I see it so yeah there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.709" end="00:15:20.330" style="s2">pieces of really interesting pieces</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.990" end="00:15:22.790" style="s2">cut there and the most interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.330" end="00:15:24.920" style="s2">is that what is the synthesis so if if</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.790" end="00:15:26.690" style="s2">you have sort of this patriarchal system</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.920" end="00:15:28.490" style="s2">which I would say so you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.690" end="00:15:30.950" style="s2">sort of conspiracy theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.490" end="00:15:32.060" style="s2">patriarchy which i think is just this it</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.950" end="00:15:35.330" style="s2">is a conspiracy theory it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.060" end="00:15:36.950" style="s2">oversimplification because if you see</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.330" end="00:15:39.200" style="s2">men as just dominating women throughout</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.950" end="00:15:43.160" style="s2">history then you just that&#39;s just wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.200" end="00:15:45.830" style="s2">because it obscures the self-sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:47.029" style="s2">that men have had the fact that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.830" end="00:15:48.649" style="s2">them probably haven&#39;t wanted to do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.029" end="00:15:50.630" style="s2">jobs that they&#39;ve done and that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.649" end="00:15:52.430" style="s2">have basically sacrificed a lot of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.630" end="00:15:54.860" style="s2">inner life to be able to have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.430" end="00:15:56.630" style="s2">to support people and the disposability</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.860" end="00:15:58.839" style="s2">of men throughout history and all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.630" end="00:16:01.910" style="s2">this stuff like it it&#39;s one side of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.839" end="00:16:05.270" style="s2">dynamic that so that conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.910" end="00:16:07.520" style="s2">is is is not true why there is some</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.270" end="00:16:10.010" style="s2">truth and the idea of the patriarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.520" end="00:16:11.830" style="s2">because we are in the West we&#39;ve all had</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.010" end="00:16:16.370" style="s2">to kind of suppress a lot of the more</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.830" end="00:16:18.200" style="s2">intuitive direct forms of knowing we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.370" end="00:16:20.630" style="s2">had this or a very rationalist culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.200" end="00:16:22.670" style="s2">that&#39;s done incredible things like this</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.630" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s created these incredible</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.670" end="00:16:29.209" style="s2">structures and also the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:30.709" style="s2">feminine values don&#39;t scale masculine</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.209" end="00:16:34.640" style="s2">value if you want to kind of create a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.709" end="00:16:37.190" style="s2">society that treats people equally then</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.640" end="00:16:40.370" style="s2">the the masculine value of the justice</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.190" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">system and stuff that&#39;s it works for for</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.370" end="00:16:45.020" style="s2">scale feminine values of inclusivity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:46.700" style="s2">making sure that everyone is included</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.020" end="00:16:49.459" style="s2">and that no one is excluded and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.700" end="00:16:51.140" style="s2">don&#39;t offend anyone may work for small</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.459" end="00:16:52.490" style="s2">groups I think any works particularly</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.140" end="00:16:54.649" style="s2">well for small groups if it&#39;s taken to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.490" end="00:16:56.899" style="s2">the extreme but it doesn&#39;t work on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.649" end="00:17:00.770" style="s2">wider scale it actually starts leading</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.899" end="00:17:03.010" style="s2">to censorship and I fear I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.770" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">already kind of in a slow-motion</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.010" end="00:17:06.740" style="s2">dictatorship of the mind like there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:08.650" style="s2">stuff that we are not allowed to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.740" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">anymore and this is what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.650" end="00:17:14.870" style="s2">terrifying about what I what I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:17.720" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re going into and I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.870" end="00:17:19.339" style="s2">of it is this sort of this feminine this</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.720" end="00:17:21.410" style="s2">sort of darker feminine energy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.339" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">kind of infiltrating the culture I want</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.410" end="00:17:27.530" style="s2">to say I think that this the tyranny of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.000" style="s2">the mind we&#39;ve kind of always been in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.530" end="00:17:29.720" style="s2">that you know that&#39;s the whole problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.000" end="00:17:31.850" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.720" end="00:17:34.010" style="s2">in in Western culture and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.850" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">somehow the dominating world culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.010" end="00:17:40.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s society of the mind we</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.580" end="00:17:42.669" style="s2">are thinking about the world in abstract</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.130" end="00:17:44.990" style="s2">terms and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.669" end="00:17:47.330" style="s2">patriarchy is based it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.990" end="00:17:49.549" style="s2">abstract thinking it&#39;s not based on</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.330" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">connecting to life on the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.549" end="00:17:54.260" style="s2">values and when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2">synthesis what I think is really really</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.260" end="00:18:01.370" style="s2">interesting is to see okay what can we</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:18:03.860" style="s2">create when the clear masculine values</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.370" end="00:18:07.370" style="s2">and the clear feminine values are</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.860" end="00:18:09.620" style="s2">allowed to be at the same time what</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.370" end="00:18:11.270" style="s2">you&#39;re saying maps on to one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.620" end="00:18:13.250" style="s2">descriptions I&#39;ve seen is by Richard</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.270" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">tarnis he wrote this book or the passion</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">of the Western mind about and because</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:21.620" style="s2">and this is also at the root of I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:23.690" style="s2">a lot of the crises that we&#39;re seeing at</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.620" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">the moment is because we cut ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.690" end="00:18:28.270" style="s2">off from a deep part of ourselves but</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:31.309" style="s2">this mashup this male rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.270" end="00:18:33.530" style="s2">materialist worldview has cut off the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.309" end="00:18:35.809" style="s2">intuitive the archetype or the religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.530" end="00:18:37.460" style="s2">the the thing that gives us meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.809" end="00:18:39.740" style="s2">I think this is why this is the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.460" end="00:18:42.039" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing and the way through it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.740" end="00:18:45.020" style="s2">is actually a kind of return of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.039" end="00:18:49.940" style="s2">intelligent integrated feminine and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.020" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">is and this is why I think that Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.940" end="00:18:56.150" style="s2">he&#39;s channeling like this this old</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:58.700" style="s2">spirit of the divine masculine and it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.150" end="00:19:01.070" style="s2">absolutely essential we cannot do</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.700" end="00:19:02.809" style="s2">without it and he is channeling this</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.070" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">thing into the culture in a big way and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.809" end="00:19:07.610" style="s2">his successes shows how much we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:11.270" style="s2">thirsting for it this this important</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.610" end="00:19:13.789" style="s2">masculine energy but it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.270" end="00:19:18.289" style="s2">matched by a feminine energy of equal</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.789" end="00:19:19.580" style="s2">power and weight because and I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.289" end="00:19:21.320" style="s2">this is this is why I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.580" end="00:19:22.700" style="s2">some truth in like the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.320" end="00:19:25.580" style="s2">article called and custodian of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.700" end="00:19:29.000" style="s2">patriarchy I think on some level I do</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.580" end="00:19:30.830" style="s2">think he may and may be quite rightly is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.000" end="00:19:31.669" style="s2">concerned about what&#39;s happened since</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.830" end="00:19:33.230" style="s2">the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.669" end="00:19:35.150" style="s2">like we have started sharing space</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.230" end="00:19:36.679" style="s2">between men and women is that going to</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.450" end="00:19:58.509" style="s2">through and forward and find this</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.100" end="00:20:01.090" style="s2">synthesis which is going to be as Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.090" end="00:20:04.450" style="s2">he also frames it by saying these are</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.249" end="00:20:05.799" style="s2">very difficult conversations to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.450" end="00:20:07.809" style="s2">these are hugely important but very</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.799" end="00:20:11.859" style="s2">difficult conversations to have we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.809" end="00:20:13.989" style="s2">the feminine rising into power power and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.859" end="00:20:15.639" style="s2">we also need the feminine to rise into</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.989" end="00:20:19.509" style="s2">responsibility at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.639" end="00:20:22.989" style="s2">those two things need to happen need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.509" end="00:20:25.090" style="s2">happen at the same time and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.989" end="00:20:28.899" style="s2">certainly true that women now have power</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.090" end="00:20:31.179" style="s2">to destroy men destroy men&#39;s reputations</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.899" end="00:20:34.359" style="s2">destroy men&#39;s careers and that power and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.179" end="00:20:36.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s right that some people do have</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.359" end="00:20:37.989" style="s2">their careers destroyed and some people</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.279" end="00:20:39.970" style="s2">do have the reputations ruined that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.989" end="00:20:42.940" style="s2">right we&#39;re not going back to the 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.970" end="00:20:44.230" style="s2">sort of madmen culture but also that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.940" end="00:20:45.220" style="s2">with great power comes great</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.220" end="00:20:52.210" style="s2">I think for me what woke me up as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.059" end="00:20:55.450" style="s2">woman about Jordan Peterson was that he</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.210" end="00:20:58.029" style="s2">was beginning to talk about a longing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.450" end="00:21:00.399" style="s2">culture along him we are in this time of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.029" end="00:21:02.259" style="s2">cares and where are the axioms where are</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.399" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">the things that are true at a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.259" end="00:21:08.169" style="s2">levels and you know as women we already</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:10.090" style="s2">know that there are these truths we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.169" end="00:21:12.759" style="s2">just been really really trained to not</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.090" end="00:21:17.049" style="s2">feel it and not speak it and he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.759" end="00:21:19.389" style="s2">to that but and I really like the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.049" end="00:21:21.639" style="s2">that he&#39;s saying hello man where are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.389" end="00:21:24.460" style="s2">where is a divine masculine because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.639" end="00:21:25.989" style="s2">divine feminine has has come massively</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.460" end="00:21:28.059" style="s2">into the world none of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.989" end="00:21:31.269" style="s2">feminine but you know that with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.059" end="00:21:34.269" style="s2">shadow as well Carly exactly chopping</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.269" end="00:21:37.570" style="s2">off and saying enough yeah but it&#39;s run</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.269" end="00:21:39.639" style="s2">amok and we need the divine masculine we</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.570" end="00:21:42.489" style="s2">need to strong the deep the mature</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.639" end="00:21:46.179" style="s2">masculine to stand up and say I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.489" end="00:21:49.210" style="s2">and we need we need the feminine to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.179" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">the same and that&#39;s what I feel is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.210" end="00:21:53.260" style="s2">what Peterson is is pointing yet but</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:55.720" style="s2">miss</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.260" end="00:21:57.550" style="s2">and he&#39;s speaking more he&#39;s speaking</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.720" end="00:22:00.040" style="s2">more to men he&#39;s speaking notes of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.550" end="00:22:02.560" style="s2">masculine I don&#39;t feel that he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.040" end="00:22:05.050" style="s2">the feminine is not important at all but</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.560" end="00:22:07.660" style="s2">he&#39;s creating a space and I want women</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.050" end="00:22:10.030" style="s2">to stand up and say okay what is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.660" end="00:22:12.970" style="s2">space from a woman&#39;s perspective how can</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.030" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">we fill this space but this and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.970" end="00:22:17.710" style="s2">also you were just saying the Divine</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.810" style="s2">Feminine is showing up a lot of Carly at</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.710" end="00:22:21.490" style="s2">the moment brilliant kind of archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.810" end="00:22:25.210" style="s2">framework and it&#39;s like and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.490" end="00:22:27.910" style="s2">absolutely right that she does because</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.210" end="00:22:29.740" style="s2">men need to find their their grounding</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.910" end="00:22:31.720" style="s2">men need to find their balls men need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.740" end="00:22:37.750" style="s2">find to stand in their masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.720" end="00:22:39.910" style="s2">say enough women test men to see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.750" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">grounded they are that happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.910" end="00:22:44.860" style="s2">automatically it needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:47.560" style="s2">women evolutionarily that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.860" end="00:22:49.320" style="s2">women have to test men like you women</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.560" end="00:22:52.690" style="s2">had a far bigger investment in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.320" end="00:22:54.340" style="s2">childbirth and bringing up children and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.690" end="00:22:56.620" style="s2">so women constantly test men and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.340" end="00:22:57.880" style="s2">it&#39;s an evolutionary necessity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.620" end="00:23:00.340" style="s2">actually something that&#39;s very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.880" end="00:23:03.640" style="s2">to men too for that to happen it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.340" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s how we evolve is is through that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.640" end="00:23:06.700" style="s2">kind of being tested and standing in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">truths and standing in our masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.700" end="00:23:13.630" style="s2">and women are very there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:16.060" style="s2">idea of men or concert men test ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.630" end="00:23:18.190" style="s2">and women test men it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.060" end="00:23:19.450" style="s2">misunderstand that and say well do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.190" end="00:23:23.230" style="s2">mean women don&#39;t have ideas that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.450" end="00:23:26.020" style="s2">outrageous dude it is no but that has</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.230" end="00:23:29.350" style="s2">always been the truth women have a much</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.020" end="00:23:31.090" style="s2">more direct kind of sense of when</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.350" end="00:23:33.310" style="s2">someone&#39;s really aligned when someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.090" end="00:23:35.890" style="s2">really grounded so men may test ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.310" end="00:23:37.420" style="s2">but they may not be connected to any</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.890" end="00:23:38.700" style="s2">sort of deeper emotional truth and they</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.420" end="00:23:41.530" style="s2">can go off on all sorts of directions</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.700" end="00:23:44.440" style="s2">women in the past have been really good</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.530" end="00:23:46.300" style="s2">at kind of seeing where the alignment is</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.440" end="00:23:47.590" style="s2">and I think men are developing more</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.300" end="00:23:49.450" style="s2">emotional intelligence are more able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.590" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">do that than before but I still think</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.450" end="00:23:54.490" style="s2">women have a deeper lived biological</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.540" end="00:23:56.470" style="s2">reality of really really seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.490" end="00:23:58.870" style="s2">deeper alignment and that&#39;s why the me</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.470" end="00:24:00.340" style="s2">to discussion again that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.870" end="00:24:02.230" style="s2">really interesting because it shows</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.340" end="00:24:02.710" style="s2">these dynamics because what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.230" end="00:24:04.600" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.710" end="00:24:06.909" style="s2">right now is that women have really</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.600" end="00:24:09.970" style="s2">really gone from him and really really</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.909" end="00:24:13.570" style="s2">testing and said speaking up challenging</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.970" end="00:24:16.210" style="s2">and what&#39;s happened is that men have</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.570" end="00:24:17.860" style="s2">kind of retreated to the corner gotten</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.210" end="00:24:19.830" style="s2">defensive or have really lost their</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.860" end="00:24:23.049" style="s2">masculinity giving away their balls and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.830" end="00:24:26.440" style="s2">what we&#39;re not seeing is that men are</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.049" end="00:24:28.539" style="s2">stepping up and saying okay enough but</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.440" end="00:24:31.390" style="s2">from a grounded perspective from a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.539" end="00:24:34.059" style="s2">perspective of hearing and embracing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.390" end="00:24:36.490" style="s2">pain but also saying that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.059" end="00:24:40.210" style="s2">limit here because the feminine needs</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.490" end="00:24:43.270" style="s2">that that it&#39;s it&#39;s no fun if we keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.210" end="00:24:46.210" style="s2">running and running and and and nailing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.270" end="00:24:49.270" style="s2">men per se on everything like creating a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.210" end="00:24:51.490" style="s2">society where where where men are</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.270" end="00:24:53.529" style="s2">dangerous for women and this is what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.490" end="00:24:56.350" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s a danger for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.529" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">happening if we don&#39;t have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:25:02.020" style="s2">balanced conversation about this because</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:05.260" style="s2">as women we don&#39;t want all the power we</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.020" end="00:25:08.110" style="s2">want we want to share that space and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.260" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">it seems like we both forgotten that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.110" end="00:25:14.740" style="s2">so we&#39;re so engaged in the antagonism in</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:16.750" style="s2">clearing the space that we forget why</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.740" end="00:25:18.100" style="s2">we&#39;re clearing it what one I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.750" end="00:25:20.860" style="s2">come back to what do we want to fill</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.100" end="00:25:23.559" style="s2">that space with what is the synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.860" end="00:25:27.130" style="s2">look like what does the what would a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.559" end="00:25:29.020" style="s2">healthy relationship look like I love</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.130" end="00:25:31.480" style="s2">this question because this is the most</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.480" end="00:25:36.190" style="s2">don&#39;t have the answer this is what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.929" end="00:25:51.730" style="s2">roots and let the men figure out what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:54.010" style="s2">it about to be a man and let&#39;s come</p>
