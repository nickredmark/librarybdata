<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:02.660" style="s2">You know people have like three...</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.660" end="00:00:04.940" style="s2">well, there are four fundamental fears.</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.940" end="00:00:07.700" style="s2">One is fear of their own</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.780" end="00:00:11.660" style="s2">inadequacy and malevolence. That&#39;s a big fear, man.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.660" end="00:00:16.360" style="s2">That can really do you in if you confront it</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.360" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">accidentally and fully.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.820" end="00:00:22.480" style="s2">Happens to soldiers sometimes in battle when they find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.480" end="00:00:24.740" style="s2">doing things they can&#39;t believe they do.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.740" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">And then we&#39;re afraid of society - that would be the oppressive patriarchy because</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.340" end="00:00:33.820" style="s2">society judges us harshly and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:37.780" style="s2">mercilessly in many ways, and we don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.780" end="00:00:39.720" style="s2">plummet in the...</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.149" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">What would you call it?</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.250" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">We don&#39;t like to see our reputation savaged in front of the groups that we identify with.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:52.679" style="s2">It&#39;s extraordinarily hard on us emotionally for that to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.680" end="00:00:57.800" style="s2">Which I wrote about, for example, in Rule 1 which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.820" end="00:01:02.500" style="s2">a chapter, at least in part, that details out the fact that the neurochemical systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.500" end="00:01:06.500" style="s2">that track your comparative status</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.520" end="00:01:11.320" style="s2">in competence hierarchies - also regulate the balance between your positive and negative</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.320" end="00:01:16.580" style="s2">emotion; such that if you suffer a social defeat, your proclivity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.580" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">experience negative emotion radically increases</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:25.060" style="s2">and your proclivity to experience positive emotion radically decreases. And people</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.060" end="00:01:30.300" style="s2">seriously do not like that. And it&#39;s no wonder - because who wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.300" end="00:01:33.940" style="s2">completely overwhelmed with sadness, and bitterness, and anxiety,</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.940" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">and resentment, and disappointment, and frustration, and grief and then, also,</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">devoid of happiness?</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:42.480" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s the very definition of Hell.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.480" end="00:01:46.700" style="s2">And if a status defeat will increase that probability</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.700" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">then we will fight very hard to maintain our status positions,</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:53.060" style="s2">which we certainly do - that&#39;s another fear.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.060" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">And then, of course, we have the fear of nature. And we should</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:01:58.820" style="s2">because, of course, nature,</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.840" end="00:02:05.560" style="s2">despite being &quot;the environment&quot; and this thing that we should be striving to protect and maintain, is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.580" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">also trying, with all of its might,</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:12.620" style="s2">constantly: to make us ill, and old and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.620" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">kill us; and is generally very successful at all three.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:23.180" style="s2">And so, there&#39;s every reason to be afraid of nature... and...</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.240" end="00:02:26.660" style="s2">you know, one night alone in the bush will pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.660" end="00:02:28.100" style="s2">convince you of that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.100" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">And then people are also afraid of the unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:36.340" style="s2">And so those are the big categories of terror that human beings face.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.340" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">And to be naked on stage is to face at least two or three of those simultaneously.</p>
