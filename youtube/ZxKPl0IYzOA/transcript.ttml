<p begin="00:05:40.920" end="00:05:44.580" style="s2">that all sort of belong together so I</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:54.900" style="s2">can&#39;t get to all the questions and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">in the last 45 minute sorry the last 15</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.900" end="00:05:58.860" style="s2">minutes of the hour I&#39;ll go through some</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.860" end="00:06:05.070" style="s2">and try to respond to them so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.630" end="00:06:06.780" style="s2">first set of questions we got was just</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.070" end="00:06:08.790" style="s2">general questions about how the series</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.780" end="00:06:11.220" style="s2">is going to progress and I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.790" end="00:06:14.070" style="s2">first right off the bat that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.220" end="00:06:16.050" style="s2">deeply appreciative of the responses</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.070" end="00:06:17.790" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been getting the commentary</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.050" end="00:06:20.220" style="s2">both quantitatively and qualitatively</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.790" end="00:06:22.890" style="s2">has been excellent there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.220" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">commentary and so much of it has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.890" end="00:06:27.180" style="s2">insightful and philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:28.950" style="s2">reflective and the way people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.180" end="00:06:32.010" style="s2">interacting with each other on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.950" end="00:06:34.260" style="s2">commentary has been respectful and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.010" end="00:06:35.970" style="s2">there&#39;s been a pursuit of a common</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.260" end="00:06:37.950" style="s2">culture of open discourse and dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.970" end="00:06:40.530" style="s2">and I want to encourage that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.950" end="00:06:43.200" style="s2">exactly what I&#39;m looking for and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.530" end="00:06:48.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve been helped by the kind of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.200" end="00:06:50.460" style="s2">and encouraged about all of this so many</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.930" end="00:06:55.080" style="s2">of you are asking how long does the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.460" end="00:06:57.300" style="s2">series go and there the plan is if your</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.080" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">hope you&#39;re ok with this the plan is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.300" end="00:07:04.950" style="s2">do 50 5-0 episodes and the idea is to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:06.480" style="s2">split it between 25 episodes where I go</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.950" end="00:07:08.040" style="s2">over the historical argument the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.480" end="00:07:12.480" style="s2">historical analysis which you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.040" end="00:07:15.720" style="s2">right now unfolding on the series and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.480" end="00:07:18.600" style="s2">then the the last 25 I&#39;m doing the</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.330" end="00:07:24.420" style="s2">course those are rough divisions as</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.070" end="00:07:27.720" style="s2">we&#39;re doing the history you see me</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.420" end="00:07:29.610" style="s2">putting in lots of cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.720" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">as we do the cognitive science I will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.610" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">constantly alluding back and building on</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:38.700" style="s2">the history and the idea behind that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:39.900" style="s2">we need this dual answer as I argued at</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.700" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">the beginning of this series to really</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:43.560" style="s2">try and address the meaning crisis we</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:45.420" style="s2">need to the historical and just the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.560" end="00:07:48.930" style="s2">historical analysis to tell us what</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.420" end="00:07:50.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost and what it means and then we</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.930" end="00:07:51.690" style="s2">need the cognitive scientific analysis</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.610" end="00:07:53.910" style="s2">to tell us about</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.690" end="00:07:55.830" style="s2">the cognitive processes and functions</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.910" end="00:07:57.660" style="s2">that we need to address if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.830" end="00:08:01.260" style="s2">to respond and potentially awaken from</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.660" end="00:08:04.380" style="s2">the meaning crisis some of you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.260" end="00:08:07.890" style="s2">asked if the video series is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.380" end="00:08:11.160" style="s2">put into a book so right now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.890" end="00:08:12.750" style="s2">happening is I&#39;m continuing the series</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.480" end="00:08:37.620" style="s2">won&#39;t be a verbatim copy from the series</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.169" end="00:08:40.440" style="s2">but it will be running the argument in a</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.440" end="00:08:45.210" style="s2">there&#39;ll be another book coming out</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.830" end="00:11:46.700" style="s2">what we need to do often is become aware</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.520" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">of how we&#39;re miss framing our situations</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.700" end="00:11:51.470" style="s2">and our problems and then at a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.290" end="00:11:53.000" style="s2">basic level misconstruing them and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.470" end="00:11:55.850" style="s2">what meditation does is it teaches you</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.000" end="00:11:57.380" style="s2">to step back and look at your sensations</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.850" end="00:12:00.340" style="s2">and looks at look at the patterns and</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.620" end="00:12:12.200" style="s2">render me free forever uncapable of</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.080" end="00:12:20.830" style="s2">of your awareness that has been afforded</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.840" end="00:12:32.980" style="s2">and so your attention to it there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.780" end="00:12:36.310" style="s2">generally directed outwards so whereas</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.980" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">the focus in meditation is very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.310" end="00:12:41.590" style="s2">cognitive and unconscious net and on</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.590" end="00:12:45.550" style="s2">contemplation is on that existential</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.550" end="00:12:50.770" style="s2">this series so you&#39;re trying to see on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.520" end="00:12:53.230" style="s2">the process of how you&#39;re assuming and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.770" end="00:12:55.960" style="s2">is signing identities you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.230" end="00:12:57.610" style="s2">see how you are fundamentally what do</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.610" end="00:13:01.510" style="s2">in reality so for example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:04.330" style="s2">contemplating the three marks of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.510" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">existence you&#39;re trying to learn to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.330" end="00:13:10.450" style="s2">the world as impermanent and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:12.580" style="s2">interconnected so and this relates to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.450" end="00:13:15.100" style="s2">the meaning of contemplation it has its</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.580" end="00:13:16.630" style="s2">origin and contemplate AO temple that</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.630" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">out to to get some some sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.540" end="00:13:24.670" style="s2">in the depths of reality so basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:29.590" style="s2">what you should be doing is practicing</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.670" end="00:13:32.080" style="s2">both a meditative meditative practice to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.590" end="00:13:35.380" style="s2">take the lens off so to speak by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.080" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">analogy and to become aware of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.380" end="00:13:40.600" style="s2">you&#39;re framing things and then you need</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">to practice contemplation practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.600" end="00:13:45.610" style="s2">bringing into awareness how you are</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.630" end="00:14:49.390" style="s2">that the West has tended to reduce the</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.830" end="00:16:09.570" style="s2">style I&#39;ve practiced a few other styles</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.020" end="00:16:14.140" style="s2">of meditation and I find the pasta very</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.570" end="00:16:15.850" style="s2">good precisely because of the emphasis</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:06.910" style="s2">you can get some sense of the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.880" end="00:18:09.880" style="s2">they belong to and see if it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.880" end="00:18:15.040" style="s2">been vetted by any independent</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.040" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">organizations or groups of users also</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.040" end="00:18:19.450" style="s2">it&#39;s important if you begin with a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:21.190" style="s2">teacher what is the focus there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.450" end="00:18:22.600" style="s2">something I tell my students when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.190" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">recommending what to do after they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:29.260" style="s2">focus is to focus the teacher or is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.100" end="00:18:31.150" style="s2">focus the teaching right and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.260" end="00:18:34.270" style="s2">focus of the teaching on your</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.150" end="00:18:37.300" style="s2">transformation or on you feeling good</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.270" end="00:18:39.340" style="s2">right meditation should never be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.300" end="00:18:42.280" style="s2">vacation from life meditation should</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.340" end="00:18:46.210" style="s2">always be an education about the depths</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.280" end="00:18:48.760" style="s2">of life and so you should be choosing a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.210" end="00:18:50.440" style="s2">instructor that is focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.760" end="00:18:52.680" style="s2">teaching and the teaching should be</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.440" end="00:18:55.850" style="s2">emphasizing transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.680" end="00:18:59.630" style="s2">challenging you to the growth</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.850" end="00:19:01.880" style="s2">and the awareness and insight that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.630" end="00:19:03.830" style="s2">are no doubt probably seeking now what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.880" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">will tell you about this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.830" end="00:19:07.850" style="s2">something you should be open to is your</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:09.350" style="s2">reason for starting meditation will</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.850" end="00:19:11.929" style="s2">change I mean your reason for doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.350" end="00:19:14.030" style="s2">meditation will will change as you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.929" end="00:19:16.370" style="s2">meditation you&#39;ll go into meditation</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.030" end="00:19:18.679" style="s2">because you&#39;re interested in relaxing or</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.370" end="00:19:22.250" style="s2">getting more peace of mind and as you go</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.679" end="00:19:24.890" style="s2">on and discover more why you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.250" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">meditation will change for you and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.890" end="00:19:29.539" style="s2">would recommend to you that that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:31.820" style="s2">a criterion you pay attention to if</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.539" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">you&#39;re engaged in a practice and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.820" end="00:19:35.210" style="s2">not getting that sense of growth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:37.250" style="s2">that your understanding and the goals</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.210" end="00:19:40.429" style="s2">you&#39;re pursuing are deepening in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.250" end="00:19:43.690" style="s2">practice then again you are there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.429" end="00:19:46.330" style="s2">chance you want to reconsider where and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.690" end="00:19:48.770" style="s2">who you&#39;re learning to practice with</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.330" end="00:19:50.570" style="s2">it&#39;s better if you practice with other</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.770" end="00:19:53.299" style="s2">people because it generally means you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:54.860" style="s2">stick with the practice if you practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.299" end="00:20:00.500" style="s2">on your own chances are you won&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.860" end="00:20:04.370" style="s2">it up the next thing I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.500" end="00:20:07.179" style="s2">to you is that you do not get into</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.370" end="00:20:10.250" style="s2">meditation by going on a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.179" end="00:20:12.230" style="s2">retreats are very powerful very</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.250" end="00:20:14.390" style="s2">transformative and for that reason they</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.230" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">can be very overwhelming and very</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.390" end="00:20:19.340" style="s2">disruptive I would recommend taking a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:22.490" style="s2">meditation course practicing for at</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.340" end="00:20:25.669" style="s2">least a year before you consider going</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.490" end="00:20:27.320" style="s2">on a meditation retreat so I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.669" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">answers a lot of the sort of practical</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.320" end="00:20:33.890" style="s2">questions I received about meditation</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:36.980" style="s2">contemplation starting a practice the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.890" end="00:20:38.659" style="s2">power of a pasta now this relates to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.980" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">another bunch of questions that I got</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.659" end="00:20:43.610" style="s2">all around that are along the following</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:46.280" style="s2">lines well John this is all really great</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.610" end="00:20:47.809" style="s2">theory but how does this translate into</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.280" end="00:20:49.610" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.809" end="00:20:52.610" style="s2">people were saying is this all like</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.610" end="00:20:55.010" style="s2">other than meditating or doing CBT like</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.610" end="00:20:56.630" style="s2">what does this all come down to well I</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.010" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t want to steal too much</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.630" end="00:20:59.720" style="s2">thunder from the end of the series</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:01.580" style="s2">because there&#39;s gonna be several</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.720" end="00:21:04.940" style="s2">episodes that are beginning to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.580" end="00:21:07.800" style="s2">directed at this and I&#39;ve also got some</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.940" end="00:21:09.510" style="s2">videos out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.800" end="00:21:11.820" style="s2">giving some instruction on how to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.510" end="00:21:14.370" style="s2">some of these practices so just to give</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.820" end="00:21:17.790" style="s2">a broad overview I mean what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.370" end="00:21:20.340" style="s2">to propose to you is right that we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.790" end="00:21:24.090" style="s2">a system of ciclo technologies that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.340" end="00:21:26.460" style="s2">integrated together for dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.090" end="00:21:29.730" style="s2">perennial problems that beset us as</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.460" end="00:21:31.410" style="s2">meaning-making cognitive agents and of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.730" end="00:21:33.690" style="s2">course what those are I haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.410" end="00:21:36.840" style="s2">about yet but you&#39;ve seen a few of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.690" end="00:21:38.820" style="s2">right you&#39;ve seen the modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.840" end="00:21:41.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about the parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.820" end="00:21:43.740" style="s2">processing these so the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.400" end="00:21:45.780" style="s2">perennial problems are the following we</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.740" end="00:21:49.740" style="s2">are vulnerable to forms of self</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.780" end="00:21:53.490" style="s2">deception and self destruction precisely</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.740" end="00:21:56.309" style="s2">because of the very processes that make</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.490" end="00:21:59.220" style="s2">us adaptive so the very processes that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.309" end="00:22:01.140" style="s2">afford our adaptive cognition are</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.220" end="00:22:03.720" style="s2">exactly the same ones that make us</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.140" end="00:22:06.300" style="s2">vulnerable to self-deception self</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.720" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">destruction and so that is why their</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.300" end="00:22:10.770" style="s2">perennial problems they are endemic to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.100" end="00:22:13.110" style="s2">us as cognitive meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.770" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">agents and so one of the things I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.110" end="00:22:19.140" style="s2">propose to you is that what what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:23.040" style="s2">looking for is a systematic set of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.140" end="00:22:25.320" style="s2">psycho technologies CBT would be one</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.040" end="00:22:27.390" style="s2">component of it but I would suggest to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.320" end="00:22:30.450" style="s2">you that CBT is actually bart part of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.390" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">larger set around psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.450" end="00:22:34.679" style="s2">called octave open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:38.610" style="s2">mindfulness detective technologies would</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.679" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">be some other ones flow induction are</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.610" end="00:22:43.950" style="s2">other ones anyways the idea is a set how</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">do they organize together and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.950" end="00:22:48.690" style="s2">structural functional organization has</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:51.990" style="s2">to be directed to this how can they in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.690" end="00:22:53.880" style="s2">coordinated and integrated fashion deal</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.990" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">with the perennial problems that beset</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.880" end="00:23:00.690" style="s2">us in a way that is also responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:03.929" style="s2">our historical situation where we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.690" end="00:23:07.140" style="s2">got to with respect to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.929" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">increasing presence in our life in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.140" end="00:23:10.740" style="s2">culture of the meaning crisis so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:12.210" style="s2">a there&#39;s a lot of sort of design</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.740" end="00:23:13.980" style="s2">demands on what we&#39;re looking for we</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.210" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">need a psycho set of psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.980" end="00:23:21.320" style="s2">that are properly constructed in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:25.050" style="s2">of our best cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.320" end="00:23:28.280" style="s2">that would help us to best address the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.050" end="00:23:31.080" style="s2">perennial problems and also have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.280" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">intellectually respectful and I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.080" end="00:23:35.850" style="s2">even say intellectually respectable and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:40.020" style="s2">even say perhaps you know potentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.850" end="00:23:41.490" style="s2">profound way of addressing the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.020" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">historical situation than the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.490" end="00:23:48.510" style="s2">crisis has put us in so this idea about</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:51.900" style="s2">all this theory being translated in</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.510" end="00:23:56.820" style="s2">practice is exactly the tea loss of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.900" end="00:23:59.370" style="s2">whole series right in the end and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.820" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">this is why I&#39;m teaching hope ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.370" end="00:24:06.030" style="s2">in the end in the end I want afford</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:07.350" style="s2">people away a you know this systematic</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.030" end="00:24:10.050" style="s2">set of psycho technologies not because</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.350" end="00:24:13.740" style="s2">it&#39;s exhaustive or a complete but as an</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.050" end="00:24:16.710" style="s2">exemplar of how people could turn all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.740" end="00:24:19.770" style="s2">this theory into practice and thereby</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.710" end="00:24:25.380" style="s2">address the meaning crisis both as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.770" end="00:24:27.800" style="s2">cultural entity and as a cognitive you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.380" end="00:24:34.500" style="s2">know process that&#39;s operational within</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.800" end="00:24:36.330" style="s2">their own lives and minds so that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.500" end="00:24:37.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean to I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.330" end="00:24:40.440" style="s2">dismiss by being promise there but there</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.950" end="00:24:42.660" style="s2">this is what the whole series is going</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.440" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">to build towards and I&#39;m going to also</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.660" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">incorporate some episodes of giving</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:49.740" style="s2">practical instruction on how to do some</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:52.710" style="s2">of these psycho technologies I have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.740" end="00:24:57.050" style="s2">few videos out there already on that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.710" end="00:25:01.680" style="s2">that is definitely going to be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.050" end="00:25:04.680" style="s2">all right so some of you have also asked</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.680" end="00:25:07.350" style="s2">me some questions about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.680" end="00:25:12.150" style="s2">science and we haven&#39;t got in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.350" end="00:25:13.770" style="s2">series to the explanation of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.150" end="00:25:16.710" style="s2">science we&#39;ve already filmed some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.770" end="00:25:19.350" style="s2">those and so I know what&#39;s coming for</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.710" end="00:25:21.990" style="s2">you and I&#39;m going to basically going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.350" end="00:25:24.030" style="s2">give a whole episode sort of dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.990" end="00:25:26.010" style="s2">to introducing to you what cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.030" end="00:25:29.400" style="s2">science is so that is definitely coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.010" end="00:25:30.810" style="s2">but just to give you an idea some of you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.400" end="00:25:32.670" style="s2">been asked me because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.810" end="00:25:36.390" style="s2">referring to third-generation coxide</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.670" end="00:25:38.370" style="s2">about you know can I recommend some</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.390" end="00:25:42.419" style="s2">Dawson&#39;s book which I have my office</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.370" end="00:25:46.200" style="s2">mind/body in world I think is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.419" end="00:25:47.280" style="s2">excellent introduction to the three here</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.200" end="00:25:51.299" style="s2">I&#39;m just getting it now</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.280" end="00:25:55.710" style="s2">Omar thanks all right so here&#39;s here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.299" end="00:25:58.350" style="s2">really good book just in to recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.710" end="00:26:01.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not an easy read this is you do not</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.350" end="00:26:02.850" style="s2">take this book to the beach because you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.320" end="00:26:05.070" style="s2">will you will get too engrossed in it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.850" end="00:26:06.330" style="s2">and died of a sunburn or you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.070" end="00:26:08.250" style="s2">possibly be able to give it the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.330" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">attention it deserves but this is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.250" end="00:26:13.080" style="s2">excellent book for describing the feed</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:16.260" style="s2">three generations really excellent book</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.080" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">I would also recommend you take a look</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.260" end="00:26:20.850" style="s2">at mark Rowland&#39;s book the new science</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:23.010" style="s2">of the mind because it gives an</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.850" end="00:26:25.860" style="s2">excellent presentation of third</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.010" end="00:26:27.450" style="s2">generation cognitive science and also to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.860" end="00:26:29.100" style="s2">discuss some of the issues that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.450" end="00:26:31.100" style="s2">essential to it like the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.100" end="00:26:34.919" style="s2">extended mind and embodied cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.100" end="00:26:36.780" style="s2">also not a book that you could just pick</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.919" end="00:26:39.330" style="s2">up and read if you don&#39;t have some</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.780" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">introductory education on cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.330" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">science or philosophy of mind but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:48.590" style="s2">where I would recommend you look if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:48.590" style="s2">want to get some ideas about this I</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.679" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say too much more about</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:26:57.150" style="s2">cognitive science right now because as I</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:59.640" style="s2">said there&#39;s going to be basically 25</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.150" end="00:27:02.460" style="s2">episodes dedicated to explaining what it</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.640" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">is and also giving you an example I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.460" end="00:27:06.510" style="s2">gonna exemplify how you practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">cognitive science I&#39;m gonna do cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.510" end="00:27:12.900" style="s2">science with you as we move through the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">analysis of the cognitive machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.900" end="00:27:17.460" style="s2">meaning-making so I&#39;m hoping between</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.990" style="s2">those recommendations the explanation</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.460" end="00:27:20.840" style="s2">and the exemplification you&#39;ll get a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.990" end="00:27:24.419" style="s2">very good answer to this question about</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.840" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">what is cognitive science and especially</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.419" end="00:27:30.990" style="s2">what is third-generation</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:35.160" style="s2">cognitive science so the next series of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.990" end="00:27:37.650" style="s2">questions had to had to do with this a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.160" end="00:27:41.100" style="s2">central theme running through it sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.650" end="00:27:43.730" style="s2">really appreciate these questions by the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.100" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">way many of your saying hello and hi and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.730" end="00:27:48.850" style="s2">hi to everyone and again it&#39;s great to</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:52.270" style="s2">have you all</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.850" end="00:27:56.260" style="s2">coming in and saying hello and sending</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.270" end="00:27:58.299" style="s2">me your comments and your support so</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.260" end="00:28:02.520" style="s2">again I can&#39;t stop and say hi to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.299" end="00:28:06.429" style="s2">everybody but again thank you so much so</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.520" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">the next series of questions have to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.429" end="00:28:10.540" style="s2">with this issue about difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:14.140" style="s2">surrounding integrating science and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.540" end="00:28:18.040" style="s2">spirituality and I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.140" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">very important it&#39;s it&#39;s a very I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.040" end="00:28:23.970" style="s2">it&#39;s the central problem in a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:27.400" style="s2">the series is trying to tackle because</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.970" end="00:28:28.809" style="s2">how do I say this I don&#39;t want to be I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.400" end="00:28:31.809" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be dismissive of other</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.809" end="00:28:33.429" style="s2">people&#39;s work III really do it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.809" end="00:28:35.650" style="s2">important to me some of you may have</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.429" end="00:28:37.450" style="s2">heard this when I was doing the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.650" end="00:28:40.390" style="s2">with Peter Lindbergh</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.450" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">and David cazuli about how important it</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.390" end="00:28:48.309" style="s2">is to exemplify a standard of practice</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:51.370" style="s2">for how we dialogue with each other so</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.309" end="00:28:54.520" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna this is in my mind right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.370" end="00:29:00.630" style="s2">as I try to answer these questions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.520" end="00:29:02.440" style="s2">important to me that I do something</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.630" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">answering those questions like what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.440" end="00:29:06.160" style="s2">have to do in cognitive science and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:07.780" style="s2">do I mean by this when I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.160" end="00:29:09.100" style="s2">cognitive science one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.780" end="00:29:10.510" style="s2">I have to do and some of you&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.100" end="00:29:12.040" style="s2">already in some of the videos I often</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.510" end="00:29:14.770" style="s2">have to bridge between different</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.040" end="00:29:17.950" style="s2">disciplines there&#39;s a video at TEDx talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.770" end="00:29:20.230" style="s2">out there on cognitive science saves the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.950" end="00:29:21.820" style="s2">deconstructive mind and so if you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.230" end="00:29:24.220" style="s2">to get this argument in more detail you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.820" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">can take a look at that but the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.220" end="00:29:27.880" style="s2">there are many disciplines we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:29.530" style="s2">the mind at different levels you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.880" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">neuroscience talking about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.530" end="00:29:32.950" style="s2">machine learning talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:34.630" style="s2">information processing you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.950" end="00:29:36.910" style="s2">psychology talking about behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.630" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">they use different methods psychology</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.910" end="00:29:41.590" style="s2">uses experimentation neuroscience much</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:42.580" style="s2">more direct observation a machine</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.590" end="00:29:44.470" style="s2">learning you&#39;re actually creating</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.580" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">simulations they talk about different</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.470" end="00:29:49.720" style="s2">entities like neural networks or working</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">memory and so what what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.720" end="00:29:53.169" style="s2">in a cognitive scientists as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:55.419" style="s2">scientist is you often have to try and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.169" end="00:29:57.970" style="s2">bridge between these disciplines and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.419" end="00:30:00.550" style="s2">really tricky thing is right is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.970" end="00:30:02.470" style="s2">bridge in a way that respects what each</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.550" end="00:30:07.059" style="s2">discipline is doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.470" end="00:30:09.970" style="s2">right and at the same time creates a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.059" end="00:30:12.850" style="s2">meaningful connection so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.970" end="00:30:15.399" style="s2">mutually and inform and transform each</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.850" end="00:30:18.850" style="s2">other in an insightful manner and so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.399" end="00:30:21.970" style="s2">see what I&#39;m trying to do this project</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.850" end="00:30:24.700" style="s2">that I&#39;m engaged with you you people on</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.970" end="00:30:27.629" style="s2">is create that kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.700" end="00:30:31.750" style="s2">between science and spirituality where I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.629" end="00:30:34.179" style="s2">I can preserve and what and respect what</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.750" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">each one contributes while also creating</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.179" end="00:30:42.909" style="s2">a conceptual vocabulary a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:44.710" style="s2">grammar that will allow them to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.909" end="00:30:46.690" style="s2">each other and mutually afford each</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.710" end="00:30:48.850" style="s2">other we&#39;ve got a cultural grammar that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.690" end="00:30:49.559" style="s2">makes them antagonistic antithetical to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.850" end="00:30:51.610" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.559" end="00:30:53.830" style="s2">disparate and disconnected from each</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.610" end="00:30:57.759" style="s2">other fragmented you can already see</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.830" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">this and so I and this is where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.759" end="00:31:01.480" style="s2">trying to not be dismissive of other</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:03.159" style="s2">people but I do not like solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.480" end="00:31:06.629" style="s2">this issue that are dismissive of one</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.159" end="00:31:09.909" style="s2">side or the other of this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.629" end="00:31:13.179" style="s2">so attempts to sort of undermine the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.909" end="00:31:15.450" style="s2">legitimacy the power the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.179" end="00:31:17.799" style="s2">science and the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.450" end="00:31:22.419" style="s2">sort of nostalgic attempts to get away</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.799" end="00:31:24.279" style="s2">from it or undermine it I will defend</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.419" end="00:31:26.110" style="s2">science against those I understand why</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.279" end="00:31:27.850" style="s2">some people do them and by the way this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.110" end="00:31:30.370" style="s2">does not mean that people should not</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.850" end="00:31:33.370" style="s2">engage in philosophic ratite or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.370" end="00:31:35.259" style="s2">scientific worldview they should there</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.370" end="00:31:36.970" style="s2">you know Jonathan pazzo does this paul</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.259" end="00:31:38.679" style="s2">van der clay does this there&#39;s good work</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.970" end="00:31:40.990" style="s2">I have disagreements with them</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.679" end="00:31:43.029" style="s2">I think there&#39;s ways in which science</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.990" end="00:31:44.740" style="s2">can be defended and respond to some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.029" end="00:31:46.779" style="s2">their criticisms but their criticisms I</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.740" end="00:31:48.100" style="s2">respect them and they need to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.779" end="00:31:50.350" style="s2">seriously and that&#39;s part of what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.100" end="00:31:52.470" style="s2">by respecting this but people who want</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.350" end="00:31:54.700" style="s2">to sort of nostalgic lis you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.470" end="00:31:56.889" style="s2">dismiss science and the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.700" end="00:32:02.590" style="s2">worldview under very pejorative terms</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.660" end="00:35:46.220" style="s2">to the meaning crisis that just says</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.880" end="00:35:48.620" style="s2">that science can do this for us that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.220" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">do not have to pay attention to systemic</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.950" end="00:36:22.220" style="s2">the meaning crisis I got a question</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:20.770" style="s2">beginning of that argument taking shape</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.490" end="00:39:22.750" style="s2">in connection with this study of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.770" end="00:39:24.490" style="s2">Buddhist metaphysics I was asked a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.750" end="00:39:27.430" style="s2">really really good question</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.490" end="00:39:28.900" style="s2">and I want to answer that question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.430" end="00:39:30.490" style="s2">because it gives me an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.900" end="00:39:32.200" style="s2">address something that I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.490" end="00:39:34.540" style="s2">about later in this series but I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.200" end="00:39:36.490" style="s2">mentioned yet so I&#39;ve been asked do I</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.540" end="00:39:38.860" style="s2">know anything about the kyoto school and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.490" end="00:39:42.040" style="s2">the kyoto school for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.860" end="00:39:44.080" style="s2">aren&#39;t aware of it was a movement of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.040" end="00:39:47.770" style="s2">Japanese philosophers in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.080" end="00:39:49.869" style="s2">century that purposely tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.770" end="00:39:51.820" style="s2">something very similar to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.869" end="00:39:53.610" style="s2">trying to do in this series hence why</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.820" end="00:39:57.250" style="s2">the question was asked of me no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.610" end="00:40:01.570" style="s2">the kyoto philosophers were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.250" end="00:40:03.460" style="s2">integrate aspects of Buddhism as most</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.570" end="00:40:08.130" style="s2">especially in Zen Buddhism but also some</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.460" end="00:40:11.530" style="s2">Pure Land Buddhism with Western</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.130" end="00:40:13.869" style="s2">philosophy particularly the work of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.530" end="00:40:16.150" style="s2">William James and the work of Martin</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.869" end="00:40:18.609" style="s2">Heidegger and also some of the early</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.150" end="00:40:20.320" style="s2">phenomenologist so the kyoto school is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.609" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">trying to do exact we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.320" end="00:40:25.060" style="s2">something very analogous to this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:26.380" style="s2">bridging that i&#39;m interested in and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.060" end="00:40:27.790" style="s2">the answer to the question do i know</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.380" end="00:40:31.080" style="s2">about the kyoto school the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.790" end="00:40:36.330" style="s2">that is a resounding yes I have read</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.080" end="00:40:39.760" style="s2">several of Nishat Annie&#39;s books I I</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.330" end="00:40:42.940" style="s2">would go so far as to say this I once I</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.760" end="00:40:44.500" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not an easy read but I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.940" end="00:40:47.140" style="s2">Nishat Annie&#39;s book religion and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.500" end="00:40:49.450" style="s2">nothingness is one of the top five books</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.140" end="00:40:52.510" style="s2">I would recommend people read if they</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.450" end="00:40:54.310" style="s2">want a profound response to the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.510" end="00:40:57.160" style="s2">metaphysical epistemological and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.310" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">existential issues surrounding nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.160" end="00:41:02.740" style="s2">it is it is it is a superlative I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.530" style="s2">I don&#39;t use this word often but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.740" end="00:41:08.080" style="s2">consider that book a masterpiece and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.530" end="00:41:09.580" style="s2">I&#39;m grateful for the fact that I got to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.080" end="00:41:11.140" style="s2">read nishitani is religion to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.580" end="00:41:14.320" style="s2">nothingness I&#39;ve also read a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.140" end="00:41:16.090" style="s2">machetes work very very interesting also</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.320" end="00:41:17.740" style="s2">a lot of muscle Ivy&#39;s work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.090" end="00:41:20.950" style="s2">particularly like some of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.740" end="00:41:22.600" style="s2">Abby did on dojin and also some</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.950" end="00:41:24.610" style="s2">connections that he&#39;s made to Jung and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.600" end="00:41:27.250" style="s2">Tillich which are very appropriate so</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.610" end="00:41:30.460" style="s2">the answer is the Kyoto school deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.250" end="00:41:33.970" style="s2">informs a lot of my thinking and I will</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.460" end="00:41:35.890" style="s2">come to them when we get deeper into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.970" end="00:41:37.540" style="s2">towards the end of this series and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.890" end="00:41:41.050" style="s2">talk about current people trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.540" end="00:41:43.330" style="s2">respond to the meeting crisis like Jung</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.050" end="00:41:45.940" style="s2">and Tillich and Corbin and the kyoto</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.330" end="00:41:48.250" style="s2">school etc one thing I would want to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.940" end="00:41:49.630" style="s2">on this is and I won&#39;t get it in a two</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.250" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">minute too much right now but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.630" end="00:41:55.210" style="s2">spoken this here and there is the kyoto</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">school and people like Tillich and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.210" end="00:42:03.670" style="s2">would also argue Jung bring out bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">about a possibility of of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.670" end="00:42:07.600" style="s2">metaphysics that is relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:12.370" style="s2">spirituality which is the position of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.600" end="00:42:15.460" style="s2">non theism and non-theism is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.370" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">that the relationship to the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.460" end="00:42:21.070" style="s2">should not be framed in the grammar and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:22.750" style="s2">language of either theism or atheism but</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.070" end="00:42:26.290" style="s2">that it needs to that grammar that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.750" end="00:42:28.930" style="s2">structure needs to be transcended in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.290" end="00:42:31.390" style="s2">very powerful way and we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.930" end="00:42:35.580" style="s2">what that means and why I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.390" end="00:42:39.220" style="s2">particularly relevant to us today and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.580" end="00:42:41.530" style="s2">why I think that is a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.220" end="00:42:44.950" style="s2">understanding one of the contributions</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.530" end="00:42:48.130" style="s2">that the Kyoto School has made to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.950" end="00:42:50.530" style="s2">project that I have the great good</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.530" end="00:43:00.010" style="s2">you some of you have asked about who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:43:04.120" style="s2">my favorite philosopher that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.010" end="00:43:06.310" style="s2">interesting question it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.120" end="00:43:08.500" style="s2">asking of all the people you&#39;ve had</p>

<p begin="00:43:08.500" end="00:43:12.040" style="s2">favorite it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.970" end="00:43:16.600" style="s2">question because you&#39;re afraid of being</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.040" end="00:43:19.990" style="s2">disloyal or or undermining what</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.600" end="00:43:23.890" style="s2">past people have meant to you um I guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.990" end="00:43:25.930" style="s2">if I had to be desert island kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.890" end="00:43:27.820" style="s2">thing I just got this book today</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.930" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">yesterday and so I&#39;m really thrilled</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.820" end="00:43:31.060" style="s2">from it because I&#39;ve read a lot of it I</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:33.610" style="s2">got the I got the complete unabridged</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.060" end="00:43:35.770" style="s2">work in one volume of Latinas so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.610" end="00:43:39.250" style="s2">would be the book I would take to my</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.770" end="00:43:40.810" style="s2">desert island applet eNOS is my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.250" end="00:43:43.030" style="s2">philosopher not because I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.810" end="00:43:44.650" style="s2">deep criticisms of him and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.030" end="00:43:47.380" style="s2">some of these later when we come back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.650" end="00:43:50.200" style="s2">this non-theistic position that refuses</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.380" end="00:43:52.860" style="s2">to decide like I think nishitani argued</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.200" end="00:43:55.300" style="s2">between emergence bottom-up and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.860" end="00:43:57.790" style="s2">emanation top to emerge temporal</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.300" end="00:44:00.010" style="s2">emergence up and eternal emanation down</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.790" end="00:44:02.890" style="s2">I think choosing or prioritizing either</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.010" end="00:44:05.650" style="s2">one of those as we sometimes are led to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.890" end="00:44:08.290" style="s2">do in either theism or atheism I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.650" end="00:44:10.390" style="s2">is part of what should be criticized in</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.290" end="00:44:12.670" style="s2">terms of the shaytani so I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.390" end="00:44:15.220" style="s2">criticisms of Latinas along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.670" end="00:44:19.210" style="s2">but nevertheless I mean leading</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.220" end="00:44:21.010" style="s2">Platonists is it&#39;s such a joy I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.210" end="00:44:22.840" style="s2">Plato&#39;s my first philosopher so he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.010" end="00:44:25.120" style="s2">always have a special role but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.840" end="00:44:27.670" style="s2">reason why I like platanus is because</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.120" end="00:44:30.040" style="s2">he&#39;s got he&#39;s this great he like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.670" end="00:44:32.470" style="s2">like the grand unified field theory of</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.040" end="00:44:35.380" style="s2">ancient philosophy because in him you</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.470" end="00:44:37.810" style="s2">have integrated you know the science of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.380" end="00:44:40.960" style="s2">Aristotle you have the spirituality of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.810" end="00:44:43.810" style="s2">Plato you have the existential project</p>

<p begin="00:44:43.810" end="00:44:48.730" style="s2">him the discourse is so beautiful is</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.290" end="00:44:50.740" style="s2">simultaneously like this logical</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.730" end="00:44:53.140" style="s2">argumentation and this spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.740" end="00:44:56.140" style="s2">exercise designed to actually transform</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.140" end="00:45:01.240" style="s2">and alter your state of consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.140" end="00:45:03.970" style="s2">I I find reading platini&#39;s a it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.240" end="00:45:06.460" style="s2">going to a dojo for your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.970" end="00:45:09.010" style="s2">in your cognition it is radically</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.460" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">transformative for me another</p>

<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:17.170" style="s2">precisely because of satisfying that</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.300" end="00:45:19.720" style="s2">broad set is Spinoza and I like Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.170" end="00:45:22.150" style="s2">because for me Spinoza represents and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.720" end="00:45:24.370" style="s2">think this is kind of explicit there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.150" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">at least some allusions in Spinoza&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.370" end="00:45:29.650" style="s2">title and some of his terminology to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.460" style="s2">neo platonic tradition but Spinoza is</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.869" end="00:45:51.310" style="s2">addressing some live questions I want to</p>

<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:22.119" style="s2">argument for that that question and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.940" end="00:46:25.630" style="s2">can go on line I have a youtube series</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.119" end="00:46:27.940" style="s2">on my thinking and reasoning course that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.630" end="00:46:30.150" style="s2">does extensive work on the psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.940" end="00:46:32.950" style="s2">insight and it&#39;s connection to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.150" end="00:46:35.800" style="s2">creativity and I think the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.950" end="00:46:39.099" style="s2">between insight and creativity is quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.800" end="00:46:39.550" style="s2">deep so trying to answer it in five</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.099" end="00:46:43.570" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.550" end="00:46:45.820" style="s2">a so please please forgive me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.570" end="00:46:48.369" style="s2">seeming to Brust but I&#39;m gonna try and</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.820" end="00:46:49.990" style="s2">give the gist of what I what I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.369" end="00:46:51.490" style="s2">that the difference is I think both</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.990" end="00:46:53.800" style="s2">insight and creativity are using the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.490" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">same cognitive machinery of reframing</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.800" end="00:46:58.810" style="s2">you know how we&#39;re formulating our</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:00.910" style="s2">problems and sizing up situations I</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.810" end="00:47:04.900" style="s2">think the difference one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.910" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">differences is that insight tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.900" end="00:47:12.300" style="s2">focused on getting a solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">problem so it&#39;s about problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.300" end="00:47:17.560" style="s2">whereas I think creativity to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:19.930" style="s2">arlynn and some other people&#39;s work I</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.560" end="00:47:23.020" style="s2">think that creativity is using that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.930" end="00:47:24.940" style="s2">machine machinery to find problems I</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.020" end="00:47:28.170" style="s2">think what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.940" end="00:47:30.490" style="s2">creativity is finding a good problem and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.170" end="00:47:32.320" style="s2">formulating it in such a way that we see</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.490" end="00:47:35.020" style="s2">it&#39;s profound in important connections</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.320" end="00:47:37.210" style="s2">to other problems and then perhaps also</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.020" end="00:47:39.160" style="s2">insightfully responding to it I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.210" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the hallmark of creativity and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.160" end="00:47:43.960" style="s2">think for that reason that creativity</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:46.839" style="s2">involves not just this carbon</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.960" end="00:47:51.790" style="s2">Machinery of reframing our problems I</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.839" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">think creativity also involves a a modal</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.790" end="00:47:57.670" style="s2">shift where we&#39;re shifting into a way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:48:00.760" style="s2">interpreting our situation and our</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.670" end="00:48:03.220" style="s2">surroundings that is very conducive to</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.220" end="00:48:07.000" style="s2">about this again later</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.619" end="00:48:45.820" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re doing that now I think the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.320" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">relationship between insight and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.820" end="00:48:56.320" style="s2">is more profound and I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.910" style="s2">don&#39;t think we should equate them but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.320" end="00:48:59.619" style="s2">think there&#39;s something central about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.910" end="00:49:02.470" style="s2">the connection between insight and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.619" end="00:49:06.369" style="s2">wisdom that&#39;s why I think it seems</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.470" end="00:49:08.230" style="s2">strange to us if we say you know sorry</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.369" end="00:49:10.630" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem strange to us if we say</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.230" end="00:49:14.290" style="s2">well that person&#39;s not very creative but</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.630" end="00:49:19.420" style="s2">they&#39;re very wise that&#39;s okay or you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.290" end="00:49:21.670" style="s2">know that person right doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.420" end="00:49:24.580" style="s2">lot of scientific knowledge but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.670" end="00:49:25.930" style="s2">very wise yeah we can sort of yeah I get</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.580" end="00:49:27.609" style="s2">that wisdom isn&#39;t the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.930" end="00:49:30.339" style="s2">knowledge that&#39;s the same thing is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.609" end="00:49:32.260" style="s2">but if we say you know that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.339" end="00:49:35.980" style="s2">wise but they&#39;re not very insightful</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.260" end="00:49:38.530" style="s2">that mote like what I and I do work on</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.980" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">this right people know that&#39;s wrong wise</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.530" end="00:49:42.940" style="s2">people right should have insight that</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:46.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re necessarily better</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.940" end="00:49:48.820" style="s2">at things like the $9 but I could pick</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.930" end="00:49:51.250" style="s2">up on one of the metaphors that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.820" end="00:49:53.740" style="s2">introduced in the chorus right as the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.250" end="00:49:56.420" style="s2">child is to the adult the adult is to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.740" end="00:49:58.430" style="s2">the sage you have more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.420" end="00:50:01.670" style="s2">cognition because you&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.430" end="00:50:03.830" style="s2">developmental stages and you can think</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.670" end="00:50:06.500" style="s2">of those developmental stages in Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.830" end="00:50:08.420" style="s2">as systematic sets of insight it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.500" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">an insight into this problem or this</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.420" end="00:50:12.620" style="s2">problem it&#39;s finding a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">pattern of error and having an insight</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.620" end="00:50:19.100" style="s2">that transforms all of those problems in</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:21.290" style="s2">a coordinated manner and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.100" end="00:50:23.330" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about wisdom we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.290" end="00:50:25.070" style="s2">talking about a systemic insight that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.330" end="00:50:28.130" style="s2">puts us through a developmental change</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.070" end="00:50:29.840" style="s2">and also the level of the insight is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.130" end="00:50:32.450" style="s2">just a cognitive level it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.840" end="00:50:37.340" style="s2">existential level of the actual project</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.450" end="00:50:41.300" style="s2">by which we are engaged in assuming and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.340" end="00:50:44.630" style="s2">I said assigning identities in in the</p>

<p begin="00:50:44.630" end="00:50:48.920" style="s2">turn to some of the live questions so</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.220" end="00:50:51.950" style="s2">there&#39;s been general questions about how</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.920" end="00:50:55.070" style="s2">to make my work more accessible I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.950" end="00:50:58.430" style="s2">point to you to an excellent series of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.070" end="00:51:02.180" style="s2">videos that are being done right now by</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.430" end="00:51:05.600" style="s2">think big animation the videos are very</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.180" end="00:51:08.450" style="s2">high quality they&#39;re about 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.600" end="00:51:11.470" style="s2">long each they&#39;re animated and they give</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.450" end="00:51:14.810" style="s2">excellent in my opinion overview</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.470" end="00:51:17.990" style="s2">summation insightful presentation of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.810" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">this argument in a way that is very</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.990" end="00:51:23.420" style="s2">accessible I&#39;d also point to the work of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:25.820" style="s2">Paul Van der clay he has released of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.420" end="00:51:27.980" style="s2">whole series of videos where he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.930" end="00:51:35.270" style="s2">would also point out my work and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.050" end="00:51:36.770" style="s2">deeply appreciate of that and many</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.270" end="00:51:39.560" style="s2">people are saying that they&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.770" end="00:51:43.550" style="s2">his exposition helpful for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.560" end="00:51:46.780" style="s2">the work that I&#39;m doing here now okay so</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.550" end="00:51:49.820" style="s2">I want to now turn to some of the on</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.780" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">live questions again I can&#39;t promise to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.820" end="00:51:58.610" style="s2">get to them all so let&#39;s begin with some</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:52:00.260" style="s2">of them where would you start with -</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.610" end="00:52:02.450" style="s2">well here&#39;s the thing don&#39;t start with</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.260" end="00:52:04.310" style="s2">both - if you start with latinas it</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.450" end="00:52:07.450" style="s2">would be like jumping into a blackbelt</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.310" end="00:52:09.849" style="s2">class right that would you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.450" end="00:52:12.579" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get you&#39;re gonna get kicked</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.849" end="00:52:15.730" style="s2">to the ground intellectually I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.579" end="00:52:18.490" style="s2">recommend that you first of all read</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.730" end="00:52:21.039" style="s2">some Plato because Platina sees himself</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.490" end="00:52:22.869" style="s2">as an intellectual descendant of Plato</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.039" end="00:52:25.480" style="s2">and an interpreter of Plato and then I</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.869" end="00:52:29.019" style="s2">would highly recommend that you read</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.480" end="00:52:32.200" style="s2">some books by Pierre hadou first I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.019" end="00:52:35.260" style="s2">recommend that you read what is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.200" end="00:52:38.380" style="s2">philosophy by Pierre hadou and that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.260" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">also read the simplicity of vision by</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.380" end="00:52:44.349" style="s2">Pierre hadou explaining to you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:46.390" style="s2">neoplatonism you might also want to take</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.349" end="00:52:49.720" style="s2">a look at some of the works of our third</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.390" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">or suus there&#39;s a book called photonic</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.720" end="00:52:57.039" style="s2">mysticism that I think is an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:58.569" style="s2">introduction to all of us after going</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.039" end="00:53:00.700" style="s2">through that introductory material</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.569" end="00:53:03.549" style="s2">reading some Plato then I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.700" end="00:53:07.569" style="s2">recommend you start with latina tsa&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.549" end="00:53:09.789" style="s2">treat treatise on Beauty I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.569" end="00:53:12.069" style="s2">a good place to start and a way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.789" end="00:53:15.609" style="s2">trying to get access into Platanos and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.069" end="00:53:18.279" style="s2">then you might want some commentaries to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.609" end="00:53:20.200" style="s2">guide you through the various and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.279" end="00:53:29.230" style="s2">aids so that&#39;s how I would recommend</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.370" end="00:54:59.620" style="s2">live authentically if I really do try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.520" end="00:55:01.000" style="s2">practice what I preach to use a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.620" end="00:55:02.860" style="s2">that I think is inappropriate to me</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.000" end="00:55:04.930" style="s2">because I don&#39;t consider myself nor do I</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.860" end="00:55:07.390" style="s2">don&#39;t want to take up the role of a</p>

<p begin="00:55:07.390" end="00:55:17.230" style="s2">to be so I I really try to go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.580" end="00:55:19.810" style="s2">understand in my own life the issues</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.230" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">that people are facing and the skills</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.810" end="00:55:24.760" style="s2">and virtues they need to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:27.310" style="s2">because of of some of the problems and</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.610" end="00:55:42.190" style="s2">it is sorry the problem with this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.110" end="00:55:43.950" style="s2">there&#39;s no way of doing this without</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.190" end="00:55:47.860" style="s2">coming across with the false pretense</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.950" end="00:55:50.680" style="s2">right of foe you know humility but</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.860" end="00:55:52.840" style="s2">humility really matters right and not</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.680" end="00:55:57.100" style="s2">being arrogant and and really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.840" end="00:56:00.190" style="s2">own up to the mistakes I have made in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.100" end="00:56:03.790" style="s2">life with people seriously make amends</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.190" end="00:56:06.670" style="s2">and also seriously trying to scaffold</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.790" end="00:56:09.850" style="s2">and encourage other people without</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.670" end="00:56:12.810" style="s2">falling prey to egocentric narcissism or</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.850" end="00:56:15.400" style="s2">arrogance and and the teachings have</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.810" end="00:56:18.010" style="s2">helped me when I&#39;ve succeeded and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.400" end="00:56:20.830" style="s2">they&#39;ve corrected me when I failed and</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.010" end="00:56:23.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s one of the most important ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.830" end="00:56:26.470" style="s2">in which they make they make and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.680" end="00:56:30.970" style="s2">continue to make a deep impact on my</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.470" end="00:56:33.240" style="s2">life so thank you for asking that when</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.970" end="00:56:36.060" style="s2">I&#39;m filming you know in front of</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.240" end="00:56:39.869" style="s2">a class or just a camera I am in front</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.060" end="00:56:42.450" style="s2">of just the people but the wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.869" end="00:56:44.910" style="s2">team I have they come off in the credits</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.450" end="00:56:47.550" style="s2">at the end of every video with Alan will</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.910" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">and Ryan and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.550" end="00:56:50.820" style="s2">intriguing and it was challenging for me</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:53.730" style="s2">when I was first doing this because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.820" end="00:56:55.890" style="s2">used to teaching in front of people and</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.730" end="00:56:57.660" style="s2">I get responses back like people</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.890" end="00:57:00.570" style="s2">laughing or at least smiling or nodding</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.660" end="00:57:02.610" style="s2">and you know Alan and Will and Ryan are</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.570" end="00:57:05.130" style="s2">doing their best to not make noise and</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.610" end="00:57:08.010" style="s2">not distract me so they&#39;re very much you</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.130" end="00:57:10.440" style="s2">know not usually responding and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.010" end="00:57:15.420" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s been really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.440" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">for me as trying to learn how to talk um</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.420" end="00:57:18.900" style="s2">some of you have made some comments and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.520" end="00:57:21.090" style="s2">I you have to understand we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.900" end="00:57:24.570" style="s2">filmed 25 episodes because so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.090" end="00:57:25.950" style="s2">make improvements about about some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.570" end="00:57:28.200" style="s2">these I have made the improvement of</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.950" end="00:57:31.619" style="s2">only using the black marker like some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.200" end="00:57:33.750" style="s2">you said I will try not to say so much</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.619" end="00:57:35.940" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about that later I</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.750" end="00:57:37.740" style="s2">think you&#39;re now getting the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.940" end="00:57:39.180" style="s2">there&#39;s an overarching large argument I</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.740" end="00:57:41.730" style="s2">won&#39;t I&#39;ll try not to keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.180" end="00:57:43.320" style="s2">and I&#39;ll try not to keep saying right as</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.730" end="00:57:44.340" style="s2">a filler word some of you said could you</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.320" end="00:57:48.210" style="s2">stop doing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.340" end="00:57:50.580" style="s2">I&#39;ll try and pay attention to that but</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.210" end="00:57:53.340" style="s2">it&#39;s been very very interesting doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.580" end="00:57:57.240" style="s2">this filming and and and and trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.340" end="00:58:00.690" style="s2">instead to picture you guys out there</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.240" end="00:58:03.869" style="s2">and what this might be meaning to you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.690" end="00:58:07.590" style="s2">and and and and and being respectful and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.869" end="00:58:14.310" style="s2">to try and getting you to focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.590" end="00:58:18.810" style="s2">work so don&#39;t forget that there will be</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.310" end="00:58:21.900" style="s2">50 episodes for those of you who have</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.810" end="00:58:25.050" style="s2">just tuned in and so there&#39;s a large</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.900" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">overarching argument the first half is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.050" end="00:58:28.170" style="s2">the historical analysis and the second</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:31.500" style="s2">half is the cognitive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.170" end="00:58:34.109" style="s2">analysis I got a question here I refuse</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.500" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">I refuse but I&#39;m sorry I refer to you as</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.109" end="00:58:43.369" style="s2">a mystic when describing you does that</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:46.770" style="s2">she&#39;ll fit well I have had very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.369" end="00:58:49.490" style="s2">mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.770" end="00:58:52.830" style="s2">my life I continue to have them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.490" end="00:58:55.320" style="s2">along a line along the lines of you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.830" end="00:58:58.010" style="s2">some very good research done for example</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.320" end="00:59:01.050" style="s2">in the in the Griffis lab and elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.010" end="00:59:04.310" style="s2">work done on on transformative</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.050" end="00:59:08.100" style="s2">experiences those have made a huge</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.310" end="00:59:11.910" style="s2">difference and impact on my work I I</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.100" end="00:59:17.340" style="s2">hope that I&#39;m coming across as not just</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.910" end="00:59:20.510" style="s2">a mystic in the sense of just relating</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.340" end="00:59:23.790" style="s2">sort of a first-person account of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.510" end="00:59:27.050" style="s2">transformative processes I also want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.790" end="00:59:31.520" style="s2">come across as a scientist who is</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.050" end="00:59:34.590" style="s2">explaining how people can cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.520" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">these experiences and why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.590" end="00:59:40.110" style="s2">transformative and also I want to come</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:42.990" style="s2">across as a practitioner that will</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.110" end="00:59:45.240" style="s2">integrate my first-person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.990" end="00:59:47.490" style="s2">all knowing of this the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.240" end="00:59:50.190" style="s2">understanding with some good if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.490" end="00:59:53.520" style="s2">allow me engineering of the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.190" end="00:59:58.680" style="s2">technology so that other people may</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.520" end="01:00:03.390" style="s2">learn how to generate these states and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.680" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">also integrate them into a worldview and</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.120" end="01:00:21.870" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons when I&#39;m doing</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.840" end="01:01:00.420" style="s2">mention that I&#39;m also involved with a</p>

<p begin="01:01:28.200" end="01:01:32.700" style="s2">daunting task not only in terms of its</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.690" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">explicit project but putting in</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.700" end="01:01:40.980" style="s2">tremendously effective I would need you</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:43.789" style="s2">know safeguards so that this network of</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.980" end="01:01:48.390" style="s2">secular monasteries did not fall into</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.789" end="01:01:52.619" style="s2">any kind of abusive system and like I</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.390" end="01:01:54.210" style="s2">said and coordinating that with the kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.619" end="01:01:55.619" style="s2">of work we&#39;re doing with the Sofia</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.210" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">framework and creating the workshops</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.619" end="01:02:00.720" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to also create a phone out</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.599" end="01:02:03.059" style="s2">so there are many things I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.720" end="01:02:05.430" style="s2">do to do this I&#39;m trying to encourage</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.059" end="01:02:08.910" style="s2">other people that I get to discourse</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.430" end="01:02:11.099" style="s2">work with to talk more more often and</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.910" end="01:02:12.769" style="s2">more frequently about wisdom its</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.099" end="01:02:16.200" style="s2">relationship and difference from</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.769" end="01:02:18.089" style="s2">knowledge its relationship to altered</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.200" end="01:02:22.500" style="s2">states of consciousness its its</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.089" end="01:02:28.619" style="s2">potential relationship to the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.500" end="01:02:29.759" style="s2">crisis things like that some people are</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.619" end="01:02:31.380" style="s2">asking through your experience do you</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.759" end="01:02:33.059" style="s2">believe public schools can teach the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.380" end="01:02:36.809" style="s2">tools of a pasta in a non-theistic</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.059" end="01:02:39.240" style="s2">manner yeah I think they could I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.809" end="01:02:43.799" style="s2">if that non-theistic framework was</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.240" end="01:02:46.529" style="s2">emphasized that would make it doable for</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.799" end="01:02:49.019" style="s2">people in a way that was respectful I do</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.529" end="01:02:50.519" style="s2">have one concern about this and I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.019" end="01:02:52.289" style="s2">it&#39;s a concern that needs to be taken</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.519" end="01:02:55.470" style="s2">seriously based on the work that Willie</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.289" end="01:02:58.890" style="s2">B will be Britain and others right is we</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.470" end="01:03:01.470" style="s2">don&#39;t have any good evidence there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.890" end="01:03:05.279" style="s2">very much good work on the effect of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.470" end="01:03:06.869" style="s2">these practices on young children we</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.279" end="01:03:08.490" style="s2">know that if you engage in these</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.869" end="01:03:11.069" style="s2">practices they are transformative your</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.490" end="01:03:12.690" style="s2">cognition and your culture sometimes the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.069" end="01:03:14.130" style="s2">transformations can be quite powerful</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.690" end="01:03:17.220" style="s2">quite emotionally demain</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.130" end="01:03:20.309" style="s2">and challenging for people they also are</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.220" end="01:03:21.809" style="s2">altering there some there is increasing</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.309" end="01:03:25.849" style="s2">evidence they&#39;re altering the wiring of</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.809" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">your brain so I hesitate about</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.849" end="01:03:33.690" style="s2">introducing meditation especially the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:36.900" style="s2">past no to children before we have some</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.690" end="01:03:38.930" style="s2">good science about so good science so</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.900" end="01:03:43.890" style="s2">that we can do a proper and informed</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.930" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">cost risk analysis cost-benefit analysis</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.890" end="01:03:47.400" style="s2">I should say or risk benefit analysis</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:50.609" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say we need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.400" end="01:03:54.299" style="s2">do that in order to I think properly</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.609" end="01:04:01.559" style="s2">decide if we should implement things</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.299" end="01:04:03.240" style="s2">like the pasta in the public schools are</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.559" end="01:04:05.519" style="s2">you planning on writing a book based on</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.240" end="01:04:08.450" style="s2">your meeting crisis lecture as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.519" end="01:04:11.009" style="s2">mentioned I&#39;m writing a series of books</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.450" end="01:04:12.660" style="s2">there&#39;s already the zombie book working</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.009" end="01:04:14.430" style="s2">with Christopher master Pietro on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.660" end="01:04:15.779" style="s2">sequel to that that is the genealogy of</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.430" end="01:04:17.460" style="s2">the meaning crisis which is called</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.779" end="01:04:20.009" style="s2">unsheltered and then there will be two</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.460" end="01:04:21.750" style="s2">books developing the response to this</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.009" end="01:04:23.309" style="s2">the cognitive science and then the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.750" end="01:04:24.869" style="s2">overall response so that series is</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.309" end="01:04:26.400" style="s2">coming out the second book in a series</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.869" end="01:04:29.910" style="s2">should come out this year</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.400" end="01:04:31.230" style="s2">there&#39;s also another book that as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.910" end="01:04:33.539" style="s2">mentioned earlier some of you who just</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.230" end="01:04:35.400" style="s2">joined is going to be the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.539" end="01:04:37.680" style="s2">continuum from insight to enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.400" end="01:04:41.670" style="s2">sort of unpacking all of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.680" end="01:04:45.930" style="s2">machinery that&#39;s involved in insight</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.670" end="01:04:49.319" style="s2">flow sensibility transcendence awakening</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.930" end="01:04:50.029" style="s2">enlightenment so that&#39;s definitely going</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.319" end="01:04:55.619" style="s2">to happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.029" end="01:04:59.480" style="s2">so unfortunately we&#39;re coming to the end</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.619" end="01:05:02.309" style="s2">of our time and I want to again thank</p>
