<p begin="00:00:06.560" end="00:00:09.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re about to run our online</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.240" end="00:00:10.880" style="s2">course again</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.200" end="00:00:12.320" style="s2">which is a course designed to teach some</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.880" end="00:00:13.280" style="s2">of the skills that we talk about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.320" end="00:00:15.519" style="s2">on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:17.119" style="s2">with amazing guest faculty including</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.519" end="00:00:20.480" style="s2">daniel schmacktenberger</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.119" end="00:00:21.279" style="s2">diane musher hamilton john viveki doshin</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.279" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">so we&#39;ve designed the course to move</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.880" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">from inner to outer</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:28.640" style="s2">and what that means in practice is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">we spend time developing</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.640" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">skills centered around sovereignty so</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">our ability to stay connected to ourself</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">to not be hijacked by the information</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">around us to stay</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">aware of our environment and then we use</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">those skills to start making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">what&#39;s around us more effectively and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">introduce a lot of different tools and a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">frameworks and models to help us really</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">understand what the hell is going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:52.640" style="s2">so yeah we&#39;ve really sifted through all</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.960" end="00:00:53.680" style="s2">of the best practices all the best</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:55.039" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.680" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">what some people on the channel have</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.039" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">called psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">to help us make sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:02.719" style="s2">we&#39;ve chosen the guest faculty</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">because of their lifetime experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.719" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">making use of these techniques</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">people like daniel schmacktenberger</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:09.680" style="s2">we&#39;re making more and more consequential</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">choices</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.680" end="00:01:13.280" style="s2">with worse and worse making to inform</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">those choices</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.280" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">which is kind of running increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">fast</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">through the woods increasingly blind i</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">think many of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">the people that you&#39;ve had on rebel</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">wisdom have been in a deep inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:28.400" style="s2">around how do we actually fix our own</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:30.640" style="s2">sense making</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.400" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">and then we also have john verveicky who</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.640" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">is a cognitive scientist at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">university of toronto and created the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">the very well-regarded awakening from</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">the meaning crisis series on youtube and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">john&#39;s session is all about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">what wisdom is how we cultivate it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:44.320" style="s2">how we see through our cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.320" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">perceive reality more clearly what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">self-deception what are higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:51.040" style="s2">consciousness what is enlightenment what</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.040" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">what&#39;s our best cognitive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:58.040" style="s2">answer of that and then can we</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">use that to create what i call</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.040" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">and communities and ecologies of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">that can</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">give us back the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">and self-transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">also connect us up to a world view</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">that valorizes homes legitimates and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">of that set of practices then we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">diane muscho hamilton who brings</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">together these amazing skills of being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:24.080" style="s2">zen master</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">and also a trained mediator what we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.080" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">is helping people calibrate and move</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">highly coherently and then really</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">difference as it arises on an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">level within the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">notice when it flips into threat and try</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">to calibrate difference and teach people</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:43.519" style="s2">how to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">indifference because that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">emergence is more likely to to really</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">make itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">to really come forward is through this</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">collision of difference that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">and we have another zen master doshin</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">roshi and doshin session is all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">the shadow which is an essential concept</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">our own personal development but also in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">how we perceive the world around us and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">the effect it has</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">so his session is always very popular</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">and here&#39;s a clip of him</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">discussing what the shadow is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">collective ways of dealing with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">collective shadow</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">and we&#39;ve developed some some collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">shadow work some group shadow work where</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">we really talk about these shadows</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">and we work on them and we help people</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">become conscious of them so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">third time we&#39;ve run the course</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">and we&#39;ve improved it each time and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">feedback just keeps getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">this is about an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">what rebel wisdom does very well</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">of exposing us to the sages of the day</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:44.959" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">of encountering new material of new</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.959" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">perspectives and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">and then learning meditative practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">of being able to look at yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">and look at these ideas and thank you so</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">much for those kinds of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">because i don&#39;t think there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">us out here</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">who understand what this transformative</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">process is that we&#39;re undergoing and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">more that we can understand and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">appreciate it and practice it the easier</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">it will be to anchor it individually</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">collectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">and organically as a groundswell</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">movement that changes the course of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:19.040" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">history human future potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.040" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">so thank you so as we said before this</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">is the third time we&#39;re running this</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">course and we&#39;ve been improving it every</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s really grown into more than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:31.199" style="s2">sum of its parts so</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">i also like to think of it as kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.199" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">process as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">as a course as a really thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">out narrative structure from beginning</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">to end and as we mentioned it moves from</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">sort of internal skill sets</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">then into looking at the world around us</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">that is also supported by the pods so</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">throughout the course everyone works in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">pods of three different people</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">and they meet once a week and as well as</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">that we have one live call with one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">the faculty or with rebelism once a week</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">and on top of that as well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">really well thought out really detailed</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">workbook which has a lot of</p>
