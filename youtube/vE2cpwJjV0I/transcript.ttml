<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">like Shakespeare Bob Dylan who</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:23.340" style="s2">incidentally compared himself to</p>

<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:39.090" style="s2">lady so who is the dark lady in Cohen in</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.380" end="00:00:42.270" style="s2">biblical traditions the dark lady is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">Lilith in Hinduism she is Kali in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.270" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">Cohen&#39;s cosmology perhaps we can say she</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:52.469" style="s2">is the gypsy wife the gypsy wife is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:55.699" style="s2">the nurturing feminine obviously but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.469" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">dark woman who would destroy the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.699" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">the Bible says Lilith wants to be on top</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">and sex in other words she wants control</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.379" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">and Dominion she will flee from the man</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">instead of spiritually marrying him of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">course feminists might object that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:15.770" style="s2">usually the man who wants to be on top</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">and dominate but that&#39;s another issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.770" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">feminists might object to the Dark Lady</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:24.150" style="s2">archetype is being fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">negative view of women but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:29.060" style="s2">mean that the femme fatale archetype</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:31.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist whether we like it or not</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.860" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">traditional culture just as the man</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">destroyer is certainly there is much to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:42.350" style="s2">be learned from this dark fiery Lilith</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">she is an essential part of existence</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.350" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">the gypsy wife might destroy us or help</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">us find redemption not by following her</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">but by letting her go the gypsy wife is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:58.009" style="s2">the one who cannot be tamed</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.149" end="00:09:42.850" style="s2">Cohen has said that an essential artist</p>

<p begin="00:09:42.850" end="00:09:46.910" style="s2">perhaps we can say that for Cohen this</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.019" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">was and the lyric that summarizes his</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.050" end="00:10:12.769" style="s2">too for the most part because he found</p>
