<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:20.619" style="s2">so last week I told you I offered you an</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.430" end="00:00:23.849" style="s2">interpretation of two foundational</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.619" end="00:00:29.170" style="s2">stories right or more than two but</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.849" end="00:00:31.180" style="s2">roughly speaking to the creation stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.170" end="00:00:32.980" style="s2">because there&#39;s two of them in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.180" end="00:00:36.430" style="s2">and then also the story of the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.980" end="00:00:39.220" style="s2">and I was presenting you with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.430" end="00:00:42.340" style="s2">proposition and it&#39;s a multi-layered</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.220" end="00:00:45.670" style="s2">proposition the first proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.340" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">that the archetypal story structure that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.670" end="00:00:50.379" style="s2">we&#39;ve already been discussing is</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.420" style="s2">reflected in detail in those stories and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.379" end="00:00:54.399" style="s2">the archetypal story structure is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.420" end="00:00:56.710" style="s2">something like the existence of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:00:58.930" style="s2">pre-existing state where things are</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.710" end="00:01:00.730" style="s2">roughly functional so that you might</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.930" end="00:01:03.280" style="s2">think of that as the state of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.730" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">going well and that&#39;s the state where</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.280" end="00:01:09.430" style="s2">your perceptions and your plans are</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:11.649" style="s2">sufficiently developed so that when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.430" end="00:01:15.760" style="s2">act them out in the world not only do</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.649" end="00:01:18.490" style="s2">you get what you desire but the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.760" end="00:01:20.170" style="s2">itself validates itself through your</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.490" end="00:01:22.689" style="s2">actions right because what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.170" end="00:01:24.909" style="s2">you act something out and you get what</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.689" end="00:01:27.009" style="s2">you intend just like when you use a map</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.909" end="00:01:28.630" style="s2">and get where you&#39;re going not only does</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.009" end="00:01:30.430" style="s2">that get you to where you&#39;re going but</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.630" end="00:01:34.119" style="s2">it also validates the plan or the map</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.430" end="00:01:36.490" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a definition</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.119" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">of truth that&#39;s a pragmatic definition</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.490" end="00:01:39.610" style="s2">of truth this is the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:42.700" style="s2">I was trying to have a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.610" end="00:01:44.979" style="s2">about Sam Harris because the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.700" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">that we have to orient ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.979" end="00:01:48.040" style="s2">world where our knowledge is always</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.170" style="s2">insufficient we never know everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.040" end="00:01:51.640" style="s2">about anything and so the question then</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.170" end="00:01:53.079" style="s2">is how can you ever make a judgment</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.640" end="00:01:54.759" style="s2">about whether or not you&#39;re correct and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.079" end="00:01:57.700" style="s2">the answer to that is something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.759" end="00:01:59.320" style="s2">well you lay out a plan and you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.700" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">think about it this way if this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.320" end="00:02:04.180" style="s2">actually an answer to the postmodernist</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:06.189" style="s2">problem of how is it that you determine</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.180" end="00:02:08.019" style="s2">whether or not your interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.189" end="00:02:09.910" style="s2">the world is we won&#39;t say correct</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.019" end="00:02:11.739" style="s2">because that&#39;s not exactly right but you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.910" end="00:02:13.209" style="s2">know the postmodernist subjects say with</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.739" end="00:02:15.250" style="s2">regards to the interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.209" end="00:02:18.130" style="s2">text that there&#39;s a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.250" end="00:02:19.750" style="s2">variations of ways in which that text</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.130" end="00:02:22.120" style="s2">can be interpreted and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.750" end="00:02:23.620" style="s2">true and it&#39;s the same it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.120" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">actually reflection of a deeper claim</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.620" end="00:02:27.790" style="s2">which they always off</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">and sometimes also make which is well if</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.790" end="00:02:31.780" style="s2">that&#39;s true for a text which isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:33.880" style="s2">complex as everything although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.780" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">complex then it&#39;s even more true for</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.880" end="00:02:38.260" style="s2">everything which is to say the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:40.600" style="s2">lays itself out in a very complex manner</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.260" end="00:02:42.880" style="s2">and you can interpret that in a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.600" end="00:02:45.570" style="s2">large number of ways so who&#39;s to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.880" end="00:02:48.370" style="s2">which interpretation is correct okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.570" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">fair enough it&#39;s a reasonable objection</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.370" end="00:02:51.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s tied in with even a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:54.520" style="s2">problem which is the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.820" end="00:02:56.140" style="s2">perception itself because if the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.520" end="00:02:59.140" style="s2">is laid out in a manner that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.140" end="00:03:02.110" style="s2">exceptionally complex then how is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.140" end="00:03:04.900" style="s2">that you can even perceive it well</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.110" end="00:03:06.310" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s partly the question that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.900" end="00:03:08.950" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to answer and the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.310" end="00:03:11.140" style="s2">that is well you have evolved perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.950" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">structures and they&#39;re actually oriented</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.140" end="00:03:15.730" style="s2">towards specific goals and your embodied</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:18.810" style="s2">so the your embodiment as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.730" end="00:03:21.160" style="s2">goal-directed entity is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.810" end="00:03:23.320" style="s2">solution to the problem of perception</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.160" end="00:03:25.450" style="s2">but it&#39;s more complicated than that so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.320" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">we could say well you come equipped and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.450" end="00:03:32.980" style="s2">this was Kant&#39;s objection to Pure Reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:34.510" style="s2">essentially that the problem is if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.980" end="00:03:36.100" style="s2">facts don&#39;t speak for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.510" end="00:03:37.720" style="s2">there&#39;s too many facts for them to speak</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.100" end="00:03:39.100" style="s2">for themselves so you have to overlay on</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:40.810" style="s2">top of them an interpretive framework</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.100" end="00:03:42.610" style="s2">well where does the interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.810" end="00:03:43.989" style="s2">framework come from well the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.610" end="00:03:45.640" style="s2">answer to that is something like it</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.989" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">evolves right it&#39;s taken three and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.640" end="00:03:49.239" style="s2">half billion years for your perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:51.720" style="s2">structure your embodied perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.239" end="00:03:54.310" style="s2">structure to evolve and it&#39;s done that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.720" end="00:03:55.720" style="s2">roughly in a trial and error process I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.310" end="00:03:57.430" style="s2">don&#39;t think that exhausts what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.720" end="00:03:59.110" style="s2">happened over the course of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s a good enough shorthand for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.110" end="00:04:04.390" style="s2">time being so so there&#39;s the constraints</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:06.130" style="s2">imposed on your perceptual structures by</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.390" end="00:04:07.150" style="s2">the necessity of survival in</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.130" end="00:04:09.220" style="s2">reproduction but there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.150" end="00:04:11.500" style="s2">constraints imposed to that you might</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.220" end="00:04:14.079" style="s2">regard two subsets of that one is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.500" end="00:04:16.329" style="s2">because you exist in a cooperative and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.079" end="00:04:18.190" style="s2">competitive landscape the perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.329" end="00:04:20.769" style="s2">structures and plans that you layout</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.190" end="00:04:22.690" style="s2">will say the maps that you layout have</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.769" end="00:04:25.060" style="s2">to be negotiated with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.690" end="00:04:26.380" style="s2">so that puts stringent constraints on</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.060" end="00:04:28.540" style="s2">the number of interpretations that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.380" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">you&#39;re allowed to to apply so you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.540" end="00:04:32.919" style="s2">think about this in a piagetian sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:33.910" style="s2">that is if there are children in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.919" end="00:04:35.860" style="s2">playground and they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.910" end="00:04:38.289" style="s2">organize themselves to play they have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.860" end="00:04:38.830" style="s2">agree on a game and the game is of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.289" end="00:04:40.630" style="s2">course a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.830" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">sexual structure and a goal-directed</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.630" end="00:04:45.220" style="s2">structure and a structure that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">delimits action and interactions and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.220" end="00:04:49.450" style="s2">they at least have to settle on a game</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:51.610" style="s2">and so that constrains the set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.450" end="00:04:53.320" style="s2">possible actions and perceptions in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.610" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">environment to those that are deemed</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.320" end="00:04:57.460" style="s2">socially acceptable and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:04:59.770" style="s2">well what are there further constraints</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.460" end="00:05:01.720" style="s2">and the constraints might be well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.770" end="00:05:04.180" style="s2">play the game and see if it&#39;s any fun</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.720" end="00:05:06.010" style="s2">and that means that you have to take the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.180" end="00:05:07.780" style="s2">plan that you&#39;ve organized consensually</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.010" end="00:05:09.730" style="s2">and then lay it out in the actual world</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.780" end="00:05:11.260" style="s2">and see if when you lay it out in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.730" end="00:05:12.790" style="s2">world it does what it&#39;s supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.260" end="00:05:15.610" style="s2">in some sense what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.790" end="00:05:19.480" style="s2">testing a tool so the idea that the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.610" end="00:05:21.460" style="s2">range of interpretations is infinite and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.480" end="00:05:24.010" style="s2">unconstrained turns out to be incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.460" end="00:05:25.690" style="s2">and now it&#39;s that that is that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.010" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">mean it&#39;s easy to figure out how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.690" end="00:05:31.210" style="s2">constrained but the technical suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.160" style="s2">that well there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.210" end="00:05:35.200" style="s2">equally valid interpretations is just</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.160" end="00:05:37.270" style="s2">not correct it&#39;s not correct and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.200" end="00:05:39.820" style="s2">not correct on biological evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.270" end="00:05:41.920" style="s2">ground and it&#39;s not it&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.820" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">correct on socio-cultural grounds</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.920" end="00:05:45.760" style="s2">because it has to be negotiated and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:48.220" style="s2">you know Piaget put a further constraint</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.760" end="00:05:50.860" style="s2">on that essentially by saying well not</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.220" end="00:05:53.050" style="s2">only does it have to be a game and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.860" end="00:05:55.690" style="s2">game that attains its end but it has to</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.690" end="00:06:01.690" style="s2">also has to satisfy some element of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.620" end="00:06:03.640" style="s2">subjective desire as well so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.690" end="00:06:04.990" style="s2">three levels of constraint right it has</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.990" end="00:06:08.650" style="s2">be a game that you can play with other</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.370" end="00:06:10.360" style="s2">people and it has to be a game that if</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.360" end="00:06:15.820" style="s2">works in the world okay well so much for</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.000" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">an infinite array of options it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.820" end="00:06:20.110" style="s2">constrained array of auctions now and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">think and that the idea that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.110" end="00:06:25.240" style="s2">proposing to you is that what evolved</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:26.230" style="s2">mythology does these representations</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.240" end="00:06:28.780" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been dealing with these</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.230" end="00:06:31.330" style="s2">archetypal representations is sketch out</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.780" end="00:06:33.460" style="s2">that landscape what what is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.330" end="00:06:35.170" style="s2">landscape of playable games that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.460" end="00:06:37.990" style="s2">good way of thinking about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.170" end="00:06:39.820" style="s2">it&#39;s it sets out a landscape it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.990" end="00:06:41.410" style="s2">sets out a description of the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.820" end="00:06:43.390" style="s2">in which the game is going to be played</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.410" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">as well as the description of the lens</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.390" end="00:06:50.860" style="s2">of the game itself and so the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:52.889" style="s2">is roughly the core the core archetype</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.860" end="00:06:55.690" style="s2">seems to be something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.889" end="00:06:57.940" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something like the interplay</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.690" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">between chaos and order and chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.940" end="00:07:02.950" style="s2">represented by hidden the serpent Isle</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:05.860" style="s2">predator because we use our predator</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.950" end="00:07:09.960" style="s2">detection circuits to conceptualize the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.860" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">unknown because what else would we do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:16.570" style="s2">that seems given that we&#39;re prey animals</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:17.830" style="s2">and given our evolutionary history it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.570" end="00:07:19.690" style="s2">very difficult to understand what else</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.830" end="00:07:21.370" style="s2">we would possibly do because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.690" end="00:07:24.160" style="s2">critical issue about venturing into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.370" end="00:07:25.720" style="s2">unknown is that you might die or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:27.820" style="s2">a slight variant of that is something</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.720" end="00:07:29.860" style="s2">might kill you but whatever those are</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.820" end="00:07:32.110" style="s2">close enough to the same thing so chaos</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.860" end="00:07:33.669" style="s2">is what causes your deterioration and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.110" end="00:07:36.610" style="s2">death and there&#39;s lots of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.669" end="00:07:38.650" style="s2">conceptualize that but but reptilian</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.610" end="00:07:40.990" style="s2">predator fire-breathing reptilian</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.650" end="00:07:42.970" style="s2">predator isn&#39;t a bad way to start and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.990" end="00:07:44.830" style="s2">the question is well what do you do in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.970" end="00:07:47.229" style="s2">the face of that and one answer is you</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.830" end="00:07:50.410" style="s2">build circumscribed enclosures that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.229" end="00:07:52.690" style="s2">order and then also you act as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.410" end="00:07:54.340" style="s2">builder of circumscribed enclosures so</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.690" end="00:07:55.960" style="s2">that&#39;s partly the hero now the hero is</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.340" end="00:07:57.550" style="s2">also though that&#39;s not good enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.960" end="00:08:00.580" style="s2">because the circumscribed enclosure</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.550" end="00:08:03.610" style="s2">isn&#39;t impermeable it can be invaded it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.580" end="00:08:07.330" style="s2">will inevitably be invaded either from</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.610" end="00:08:10.570" style="s2">the outside or from within right and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.330" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">we&#39;ve been conceptualizing the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.570" end="00:08:14.500" style="s2">predator the malevolent predator at</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:16.660" style="s2">multiple levels of analysis throughout</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.500" end="00:08:18.310" style="s2">our evolutionary history say but also in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.660" end="00:08:20.260" style="s2">our symbolic history trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.310" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">understand the nature of that which</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.260" end="00:08:24.580" style="s2">invades the enclosure right and we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.680" style="s2">say well it&#39;s partly external threat</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.580" end="00:08:29.139" style="s2">it&#39;s partly social threat but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.680" end="00:08:31.419" style="s2">partly the threat that each individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.139" end="00:08:33.130" style="s2">brings to bear on the social structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.419" end="00:08:35.140" style="s2">because of our let&#39;s say our intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.130" end="00:08:37.959" style="s2">malevolence and so that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.140" end="00:08:40.539" style="s2">snakes within and so that accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.959" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">the analogy that the Christian analogy</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.539" end="00:08:43.900" style="s2">between the serpent in the Garden of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:46.180" style="s2">Eden and Satan which is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.900" end="00:08:47.830" style="s2">strange analogy it&#39;s not obvious at all</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.180" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">why those two things would stack on top</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.830" end="00:08:52.450" style="s2">of one another especially given that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:54.910" style="s2">when the creation story originally</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.450" end="00:08:56.529" style="s2">emerged in the in the form I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.910" end="00:08:58.779" style="s2">you about last week the story of Adam</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.529" end="00:09:00.550" style="s2">and Eve the idea that the serpent in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.779" end="00:09:03.130" style="s2">garden was also something that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.550" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">associated with the adversary wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.130" end="00:09:06.519" style="s2">implicit part of the story</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:09.190" style="s2">that got laid on afterwards like well</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.519" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2">what&#39;s the worst possible snake well</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.190" end="00:09:12.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a reasonable question and then a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.050" end="00:09:15.339" style="s2">better question is what do you do about</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.760" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">the worst possible snake and one answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.339" end="00:09:18.430" style="s2">is you face it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.709" style="s2">but there&#39;s other answers too like you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.430" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">make sacrifices right and that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.709" end="00:09:25.990" style="s2">stave off the dragon of temporal chaos</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:28.300" style="s2">roughly speaking is that you learn to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.990" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">conceptualize the future you see the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.300" end="00:09:32.290" style="s2">future as a realm of potential threat</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.540" style="s2">and then you learn to give things up in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.290" end="00:09:37.149" style="s2">the present and somehow that satisfies</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.540" end="00:09:39.250" style="s2">the future now so maybe you&#39;re offering</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.149" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">sacrifices to God and you think well why</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.250" end="00:09:42.790" style="s2">is that well think you&#39;re going to think</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:46.060" style="s2">about that psychologically why does that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.790" end="00:09:48.870" style="s2">work well you can think about the Spirit</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.060" end="00:09:52.510" style="s2">of God the Father as an imagistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.870" end="00:09:54.459" style="s2">representation of the collective spirit</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.510" end="00:09:56.170" style="s2">of the group we&#39;ll call it the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.459" end="00:09:58.750" style="s2">patriarchy if you want doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.170" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s common across the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.750" end="00:10:03.430" style="s2">group as a spirit as a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">force across time why do you make</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.430" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">sacrifices to that that is what you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:10.180" style="s2">all the time you&#39;re right now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">sacrificing your time to the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.180" end="00:10:15.819" style="s2">the great Father because your assumption</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:17.829" style="s2">is is that if you do what&#39;s diligent so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.819" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">you&#39;re not chasing impulsive pleasure at</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.829" end="00:10:21.100" style="s2">the moment unless you&#39;re pathologically</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:23.050" style="s2">interested in this class or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.100" end="00:10:24.910" style="s2">like that you&#39;re not chasing impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.050" end="00:10:26.529" style="s2">interest you&#39;re sacrificing your</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.910" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">impulsive interests to satisfy the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.529" end="00:10:30.850" style="s2">spirit of social requirement and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:32.529" style="s2">you&#39;re offering a sacrifice to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.850" end="00:10:34.449" style="s2">spirit in the hope that you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.529" end="00:10:36.699" style="s2">bargain with it so that it will reward</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.449" end="00:10:38.860" style="s2">you in the future and that reward will</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.699" end="00:10:41.649" style="s2">be part of it partly the staving off of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.860" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">insecurities which is ever no more than</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.649" end="00:10:44.350" style="s2">to say that part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">you&#39;re getting your degree is because</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.350" end="00:10:48.760" style="s2">you believe that you laid you in finding</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:51.190" style="s2">employment and status and all the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.760" end="00:10:55.089" style="s2">things that will stave off the dragon of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.190" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">chaos so now those things were as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.089" end="00:11:00.130" style="s2">been at pains to to to point out as</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.360" end="00:11:01.959" style="s2">those things were acted out and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.130" end="00:11:03.819" style="s2">represented an image and story long</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.959" end="00:11:05.709" style="s2">before they could be fully articulated</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.819" end="00:11:08.230" style="s2">because we&#39;re building our knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.709" end="00:11:10.660" style="s2">ourselves and also our social structures</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.230" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">and also the world from the bottom up as</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.660" end="00:11:13.899" style="s2">well as from the top down there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:18.250" style="s2">interplay between the two levels of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.899" end="00:11:19.930" style="s2">analysis okay and so so that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.250" end="00:11:21.970" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.930" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">underpinning and then with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.970" end="00:11:26.890" style="s2">the stories themselves you&#39;re you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:29.830" style="s2">a map so to speak you&#39;re using a map and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.890" end="00:11:31.570" style="s2">with any luck its detailed enough so</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.830" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">that you can use it to get to the place</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.570" end="00:11:35.890" style="s2">that you want to go and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:38.830" style="s2">don&#39;t and that means that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.890" end="00:11:41.170" style="s2">recalibrate your your journey along the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.830" end="00:11:44.080" style="s2">map which by the way is exactly what GPS</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.170" end="00:11:45.490" style="s2">systems do when you go off the pathway</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.080" end="00:11:48.100" style="s2">right they stop</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.490" end="00:11:50.920" style="s2">that&#39;s an anxiety response from the GPS</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.100" end="00:11:53.500" style="s2">system they stop they recalibrate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.920" end="00:11:55.150" style="s2">they readjust the map now and then if</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.500" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">you&#39;re unfortunate this very rarely</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.150" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">happens anymore you&#39;ll be on a road that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t mapped and then the GPS system</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:02.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know what to do well that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:04.360" style="s2">happens in real life too I mean those</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.590" end="00:12:06.520" style="s2">are I&#39;m using GPS for a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.360" end="00:12:07.690" style="s2">reason those are intelligent systems as</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.520" end="00:12:09.490" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned those are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.690" end="00:12:11.140" style="s2">closest things we ever designed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.490" end="00:12:13.270" style="s2">intelligent systems because they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.140" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">actually orient right they orient in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.270" end="00:12:16.750" style="s2">real time and they&#39;re unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:19.480" style="s2">sophisticated systems right because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.750" end="00:12:20.980" style="s2">rely on a huge satellite network and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.480" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">on and they&#39;re cybernetic systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.980" end="00:12:28.060" style="s2">technically speaking they respond very</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:30.130" style="s2">much like the way that we respond so so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.060" end="00:12:33.430" style="s2">anyways you know you&#39;re in un habit a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.130" end="00:12:35.710" style="s2">map you try to adjust the resolution of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.430" end="00:12:37.240" style="s2">the map so that it&#39;s mono more complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.710" end="00:12:39.250" style="s2">than it needs to be to get you from</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.240" end="00:12:41.980" style="s2">point A to point B that&#39;s it you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.250" end="00:12:43.780" style="s2">minimal resolution because that enables</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.980" end="00:12:45.940" style="s2">efficient cognitive processing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.780" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t overload you too much like when</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.940" end="00:12:50.170" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at this room if I look say I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">want to walk down this pathway basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.170" end="00:12:53.650" style="s2">what my mind does my perceptual field</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:55.960" style="s2">and you can detect this if I look</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.650" end="00:12:57.670" style="s2">straight ahead I can barely see you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.960" end="00:13:01.420" style="s2">people on the periphery you&#39;re more like</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.670" end="00:13:02.890" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of like blurs you - I can</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.420" end="00:13:04.840" style="s2">tell that you have heads but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.890" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">about it when you move I can see your</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.840" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.230" end="00:13:09.490" style="s2">I can probably see your eyes but barely</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:11.320" style="s2">so you&#39;re all very low resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.490" end="00:13:13.030" style="s2">even though I can&#39;t detect it at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.320" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">very periphery of my vision you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.030" end="00:13:16.390" style="s2">black and white so my color vision</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.100" style="s2">disappears at the periphery even though</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.390" end="00:13:20.410" style="s2">I can&#39;t I can&#39;t actually perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.100" end="00:13:22.450" style="s2">so what happens is if I want to walk</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.410" end="00:13:24.670" style="s2">down here this pathway becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.450" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">high-resolution it becomes marked with</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.670" end="00:13:28.660" style="s2">positive emotion all of this turns into</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:31.150" style="s2">low resolution back here it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.660" end="00:13:31.910" style="s2">represented and then I find out well am</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.150" end="00:13:33.860" style="s2">i doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.910" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">properly and the answer is while I walk</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.860" end="00:13:39.290" style="s2">forward and if I get to the goal then</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:40.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve done it properly enough and if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.290" end="00:13:42.260" style="s2">know what have you stand up and get in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.670" end="00:13:44.030" style="s2">my way then I&#39;m going to focus on you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.260" end="00:13:47.240" style="s2">and assume instantly that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.030" end="00:13:50.120" style="s2">mapped you properly right I put you in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.240" end="00:13:52.070" style="s2">the category of irrelevant entity when</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.120" end="00:13:55.520" style="s2">in fact you have to be in the category</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.070" end="00:13:58.790" style="s2">of strange object the thing that objects</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.520" end="00:14:00.560" style="s2">and so well so then we inhabit those</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.790" end="00:14:01.910" style="s2">structures all the time we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.560" end="00:14:05.030" style="s2">structure like that a perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.910" end="00:14:07.730" style="s2">structure and if it&#39;s working then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.030" end="00:14:10.280" style="s2">got the archetypal quality of paradise</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.730" end="00:14:12.200" style="s2">so to speak because it&#39;s axioms are</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.280" end="00:14:13.880" style="s2">correct and it&#39;s functional and then now</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.200" end="00:14:15.590" style="s2">and then something comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.880" end="00:14:17.990" style="s2">that&#39;s what the snake is the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.590" end="00:14:20.390" style="s2">snake in the garden that pops up inside</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.990" end="00:14:22.700" style="s2">a structure and it turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.390" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">things that you weren&#39;t attending to are</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.700" end="00:14:27.290" style="s2">the most important things rather than</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:29.750" style="s2">the least important things and that what</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.290" end="00:14:32.960" style="s2">does I do it blows the map into pieces</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.750" end="00:14:35.900" style="s2">and that can happen at different levels</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.960" end="00:14:38.660" style="s2">of severity but at the ultimate level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.900" end="00:14:41.090" style="s2">severity its apocalyptic right</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.660" end="00:14:43.730" style="s2">everything goes and that&#39;s it that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.090" end="00:14:46.340" style="s2">traumatic intrusion and essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.730" end="00:14:48.530" style="s2">story of the Garden of Eden is the story</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.340" end="00:14:50.090" style="s2">of a traumatic intrusion that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.530" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">what it is and so what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.090" end="00:14:53.990" style="s2">Adam and Eve are living in unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:14:55.640" style="s2">bliss roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.990" end="00:14:57.320" style="s2">everything&#39;s fine they&#39;re in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.640" end="00:14:59.270" style="s2">walled garden they&#39;re in a paradisal</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.320" end="00:15:01.880" style="s2">state they&#39;re not aware of their own</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.270" end="00:15:03.670" style="s2">vulnerability or nakedness so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.880" end="00:15:06.650" style="s2">not suffering from negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.670" end="00:15:08.750" style="s2">something pops up that radically expands</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.650" end="00:15:11.150" style="s2">their vision and all of a sudden now</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.750" end="00:15:13.460" style="s2">they can apprehend all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.150" end="00:15:15.080" style="s2">that exist as threats so that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.460" end="00:15:17.390" style="s2">own nakedness and vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.080" end="00:15:20.450" style="s2">temporality itself because they become</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.390" end="00:15:23.060" style="s2">aware of the future and bang that state</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.450" end="00:15:25.340" style="s2">of being in that paradise is forever</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.060" end="00:15:28.010" style="s2">gone that&#39;s the strange thing about</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.340" end="00:15:30.650" style="s2">human beings this is what what happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.010" end="00:15:33.800" style="s2">to us I think is that our perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.650" end="00:15:37.280" style="s2">developed to such a degree that we could</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.800" end="00:15:38.960" style="s2">no longer ignore what was irrelevant we</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.280" end="00:15:41.780" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do it because we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.960" end="00:15:44.990" style="s2">roughly speaking once we discovered our</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.780" end="00:15:46.279" style="s2">finite limitations in time and space we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.990" end="00:15:49.850" style="s2">discovered that we were surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.279" end="00:15:51.880" style="s2">infinite threat always and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.850" end="00:15:54.260" style="s2">why people are so hyper awake because</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.880" end="00:15:57.860" style="s2">threat wakes you up well we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.260" end="00:16:01.459" style="s2">constant state of existential threat now</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.860" end="00:16:03.520" style="s2">the advantage to that is that we take we</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.459" end="00:16:05.779" style="s2">take arms up against a sea of troubles</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.520" end="00:16:07.940" style="s2">constantly that&#39;s the advantage right</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.779" end="00:16:10.040" style="s2">and we build enclosures and we take</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.940" end="00:16:11.690" style="s2">precautions for the future and we live a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.040" end="00:16:13.700" style="s2">very long time and we generally live</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.690" end="00:16:17.000" style="s2">quite safe lives compared to the lives</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.700" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">we could live and so we&#39;ve traded pain</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.000" end="00:16:20.839" style="s2">for anxiety that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:23.630" style="s2">thinking about it now it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.839" end="00:16:25.220" style="s2">pretty rough trade right because who</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.630" end="00:16:27.080" style="s2">wants to be nervous all the time but</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.220" end="00:16:28.459" style="s2">you&#39;re alive and awake when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.080" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">nervous and it is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.459" end="00:16:33.620" style="s2">consciousness elevating activation</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:35.779" style="s2">that&#39;s another way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.620" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">so the story of Adam and Eve is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.779" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">story of the eternal fall that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:43.339" style="s2">it says look you exist in these walled</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">enclosures but there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.339" end="00:16:47.240" style="s2">lurks that will always knock you off</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:49.220" style="s2">your feet and then the question is what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.240" end="00:16:50.600" style="s2">is that and and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.220" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">being formulated over very long periods</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.600" end="00:16:55.880" style="s2">of time partly it&#39;s the probability of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">predation itself that&#39;s the snake the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.880" end="00:16:59.959" style="s2">thing that can come in subtly and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:05.300" style="s2">undermine you okay but then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.959" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s it what would you call it expand</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.300" end="00:17:10.130" style="s2">it upward to include the abstract snake</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:12.500" style="s2">which is that thing that can undermine</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.130" end="00:17:14.179" style="s2">your conceptual schemes right so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.500" end="00:17:15.890" style="s2">have your actual territory and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.179" end="00:17:17.630" style="s2">have your abstract to our territory and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.890" end="00:17:19.640" style="s2">in your actual territory there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.630" end="00:17:21.829" style="s2">actual snakes and in your abstract</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.640" end="00:17:24.800" style="s2">territory there are abstract snakes</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.829" end="00:17:27.620" style="s2">right and then the worst snake of all is</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.800" end="00:17:30.230" style="s2">malevolence and that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.620" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">technically correct because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.230" end="00:17:33.980" style="s2">things that you view for example when</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.980" end="00:17:37.910" style="s2">disorder is that it&#39;s almost always the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:39.770" style="s2">case that someone who suffers from</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.910" end="00:17:43.390" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder which you</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.770" end="00:17:46.280" style="s2">might think of as a real real life</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.390" end="00:17:47.809" style="s2">reincarnation of the fall is that people</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.010" end="00:17:55.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like suffering is one thing man</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.880" end="00:17:58.670" style="s2">suffering that&#39;s bad enough but to</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.220" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">especially what it also reflects</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.890" end="00:18:11.450" style="s2">something back to you about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.940" style="s2">because if someone else can do that to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.450" end="00:18:15.950" style="s2">you and they&#39;re human that means that</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.950" end="00:18:19.340" style="s2">strangely enough that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.870" end="00:18:22.070" style="s2">cure to some degree to post-traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:23.720" style="s2">stress disorder is like if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.070" end="00:18:25.790" style="s2">victimized you&#39;re naive and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.720" end="00:18:28.130" style="s2">victimized the way out of that is to no</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.790" end="00:18:30.260" style="s2">longer be naive and to no longer be</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.130" end="00:18:31.490" style="s2">victimized and that means that you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.260" end="00:18:33.620" style="s2">see this reflected in the Harry Potter</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.490" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">idea for example that the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.620" end="00:18:38.900" style="s2">Harry Potter can withstand Voldemort is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:40.730" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got a piece of a party&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.900" end="00:18:43.580" style="s2">being touched by it and the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.730" end="00:18:46.040" style="s2">the way that you keep the psychopaths at</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.580" end="00:18:47.630" style="s2">bay is to develop the inner psychopath</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.040" end="00:18:49.340" style="s2">so that you know when when you see what</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:51.860" style="s2">right and then but that&#39;s a voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.340" end="00:18:54.170" style="s2">thing it&#39;s it&#39;s so it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.860" end="00:18:56.180" style="s2">a a set of tools that you have at your</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.170" end="00:18:58.700" style="s2">disposal which is full knowledge of evil</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.180" end="00:19:00.680" style="s2">and that does Nietzsche said if you look</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.700" end="00:19:02.660" style="s2">into an abyss for too long you risk</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.680" end="00:19:04.580" style="s2">having the abyss gaze back into you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.660" end="00:19:06.350" style="s2">right the idea is that if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.580" end="00:19:08.540" style="s2">something monstrous you have a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.350" end="00:19:11.090" style="s2">to turn into a monster and people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.540" end="00:19:13.460" style="s2">often very afraid of looking at monsters</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.090" end="00:19:14.810" style="s2">things exactly for that reason and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.460" end="00:19:16.550" style="s2">the question is well should you turn</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.810" end="00:19:19.040" style="s2">into a monster and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.550" end="00:19:22.310" style="s2">yes you should but you should do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.040" end="00:19:24.170" style="s2">voluntarily and not accidentally and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.310" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">should do it with the good in mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.170" end="00:19:28.190" style="s2">rather than falling prey to it by</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:30.170" style="s2">possession essentially because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.190" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">the alternative how does it possess you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.170" end="00:19:33.560" style="s2">that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">you&#39;re suffering makes you better you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.560" end="00:19:38.930" style="s2">better this makes you resentful you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:41.060" style="s2">resentful means meat makes you vengeful</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.930" end="00:19:44.210" style="s2">and once you&#39;re on that road you go down</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.060" end="00:19:46.370" style="s2">that a little bit farther man well you</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.210" end="00:19:48.140" style="s2">end up it fantasizing in your basement</p>

<p begin="00:20:56.260" end="00:21:00.520" style="s2">twice okay so your eyes have to open up</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.270" end="00:21:13.660" style="s2">is the movement down into the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.130" end="00:21:14.110" style="s2">and with the revitalization of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.340" end="00:21:25.390" style="s2">can withstand malevolence maybe you can</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.170" end="00:23:26.710" style="s2">child with something that can help them</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:30.330" style="s2">chop them into pieces and make the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.710" end="00:23:32.500" style="s2">out of them so that the trick for human</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.330" end="00:23:34.510" style="s2">thriving in the face of suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.500" end="00:23:37.180" style="s2">malevolence is strength not protection</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.510" end="00:23:39.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a completely different idea we also</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.180" end="00:23:41.080" style="s2">know this clinically we know for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.160" end="00:23:44.350" style="s2">that if you treat people with exposure</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.080" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">therapy for Agra phobia which is roughly</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.350" end="00:23:48.430" style="s2">speaking the fear of chaos I would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:49.330" style="s2">the fear of everything you don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.430" end="00:23:51.880" style="s2">them less afraid</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.330" end="00:23:53.860" style="s2">you make the braver it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.880" end="00:23:56.040" style="s2">thing because with an agri-food they see</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.860" end="00:23:58.870" style="s2">what happens to them is is the fault</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.040" end="00:24:01.510" style="s2">they never conceptualize death and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.870" end="00:24:02.860" style="s2">suffering they&#39;re naive right it never</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.510" end="00:24:04.690" style="s2">enters their theater of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.860" end="00:24:06.580" style="s2">imaginations because they&#39;re protected</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.690" end="00:24:08.560" style="s2">from it but then something happens this</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.580" end="00:24:10.210" style="s2">often happens to women in their 40s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.560" end="00:24:13.510" style="s2">because they&#39;re the people most likely</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.210" end="00:24:15.700" style="s2">to develop Agra phobia something happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.510" end="00:24:18.100" style="s2">there they&#39;ve been protected from chaos</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.700" end="00:24:19.900" style="s2">by Authority their entire life so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.100" end="00:24:21.040" style="s2">they had an overprotective father and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.900" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">then they went to an overprotective</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.040" end="00:24:24.850" style="s2">boyfriend and then they went to an</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.710" style="s2">overprotective husband and maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.850" end="00:24:28.150" style="s2">were willing to be subjugated to all</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.710" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">three of those because of the project</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.150" end="00:24:33.550" style="s2">protection right so so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.320" style="s2">bargain they stay weak and dependent and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.550" end="00:24:37.240" style="s2">maybe they have to because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.320" end="00:24:38.800" style="s2">only way they can appeal to the person</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.240" end="00:24:40.210" style="s2">who&#39;s hyper protective but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.800" end="00:24:42.070" style="s2">they pay for that is that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.210" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">sufficiently competent and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.070" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">something happens in their life often in</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:48.010" style="s2">their 40s they develop heart</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:51.040" style="s2">palpitations maybe as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.010" end="00:24:52.750" style="s2">menopause their heart starts to beat</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.040" end="00:24:54.250" style="s2">erratically and they think oh no death</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.750" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like well who are you going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.250" end="00:24:57.310" style="s2">to about that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:59.890" style="s2">right there&#39;s no protection from</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.310" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">authority for that or maybe their friend</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.890" end="00:25:03.310" style="s2">gets divorced or maybe their sister dies</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:05.500" style="s2">or something like that it brings up the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.310" end="00:25:07.540" style="s2">specter of mortality and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.500" end="00:25:09.880" style="s2">specter of malevolence and mortality and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.540" end="00:25:12.340" style="s2">it brings it up in a way that authority</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.880" end="00:25:14.590" style="s2">recourse to Authority cannot solve and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.340" end="00:25:16.150" style="s2">so then they have panic attacks what</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.590" end="00:25:17.710" style="s2">happens they go out they get afraid they</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.150" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">feel their heart beating then they get</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.710" end="00:25:20.590" style="s2">afraid of their heart beating because</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:22.750" style="s2">they think oh no I&#39;m going to die</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.590" end="00:25:24.430" style="s2">and they think oh no I&#39;m going to die</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.750" end="00:25:26.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to make a fool of myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.430" end="00:25:28.680" style="s2">while I&#39;m doing it and attract a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.380" end="00:25:31.690" style="s2">attention so the two big fears come up</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.680" end="00:25:33.250" style="s2">mortality and social judgment then they</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.690" end="00:25:35.560" style="s2">have a panic attack it&#39;s like fighter</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.250" end="00:25:37.750" style="s2">flights going out of control very very</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.560" end="00:25:39.700" style="s2">unpleasant then they start to avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.750" end="00:25:41.020" style="s2">places they&#39;ve had a panic attack then</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.700" end="00:25:42.460" style="s2">they end up not being able to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.020" end="00:25:44.920" style="s2">anywhere so then</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.460" end="00:25:47.620" style="s2">Kyah math has come back right a huge</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.920" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">monster a little victim and so what do</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.620" end="00:25:53.230" style="s2">you do with them well there&#39;s no saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:56.740" style="s2">note there&#39;s no time app that&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.230" end="00:25:58.930" style="s2">right there naivety is over they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.740" end="00:26:00.610" style="s2">a direct contact with the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.930" end="00:26:02.650" style="s2">mortality and social judgment they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.610" end="00:26:04.660" style="s2">met the terrible mother and they met the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.650" end="00:26:07.060" style="s2">terrible father and there&#39;s no going</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.660" end="00:26:10.570" style="s2">back there&#39;s no saying oh the world is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.060" end="00:26:11.140" style="s2">safe it&#39;s not safe not at all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.570" end="00:26:13.330" style="s2">safe</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.140" end="00:26:14.800" style="s2">the fact that you think it&#39;s safe means</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.330" end="00:26:16.780" style="s2">that you were living in an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.800" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">bubble that was sort of provided to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.780" end="00:26:22.900" style="s2">by your culture it&#39;s a gift and now</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:25.330" style="s2">that&#39;s been shattered and so now what do</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.900" end="00:26:26.770" style="s2">you do well the answer is you retreat</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.330" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">until you&#39;re in your house and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.770" end="00:26:30.580" style="s2">nowhere you can go you&#39;re the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">frozen rabbit right and your life is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.580" end="00:26:35.410" style="s2">hell because you can&#39;t function</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:38.050" style="s2">the alternative is let&#39;s take apart the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.410" end="00:26:40.140" style="s2">things you&#39;re afraid of let&#39;s expose you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.050" end="00:26:43.450" style="s2">to them you know carefully and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.140" end="00:26:45.370" style="s2">programmatically and then you&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.450" end="00:26:47.860" style="s2">that you can you&#39;re actually tougher</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.370" end="00:26:49.420" style="s2">than you think you never knew that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.860" end="00:26:51.370" style="s2">maybe you didn&#39;t want to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.420" end="00:26:52.190" style="s2">responsibility because you know people</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.370" end="00:26:54.139" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.190" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">role in their own demise so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.139" end="00:26:58.970" style="s2">when you had opportunity to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:01.009" style="s2">explore or withdraw because you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.970" end="00:27:02.899" style="s2">afraid you chose to withdraw because you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.009" end="00:27:04.730" style="s2">were afraid so it&#39;s not only that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.899" end="00:27:06.440" style="s2">were over protected often it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.730" end="00:27:08.629" style="s2">were willing to take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.440" end="00:27:10.460" style="s2">fact that you were over protected and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.629" end="00:27:12.679" style="s2">run back there whenever you had the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.460" end="00:27:14.059" style="s2">opportunity you know so maybe you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.679" end="00:27:15.590" style="s2">kid in the playground right and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.059" end="00:27:17.450" style="s2">having some trouble with other kids and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.590" end="00:27:19.129" style="s2">you know in the back of your mind I</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.450" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">should deal this with deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.129" end="00:27:22.820" style="s2">myself but you go and tell your mom and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:24.440" style="s2">get her to intervene and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.820" end="00:27:26.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not right you know that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.440" end="00:27:28.850" style="s2">breaking the social contract but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.360" end="00:27:30.919" style="s2">easier and so that&#39;s what you do you run</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.850" end="00:27:33.139" style="s2">off to an authority figure and hide</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.919" end="00:27:34.730" style="s2">behind the Great Father right roughly</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.139" end="00:27:36.590" style="s2">speaking well the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.730" end="00:27:38.570" style="s2">you don&#39;t learn how to do it yourself so</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.590" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">then you have to relearn it painfully</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.570" end="00:27:44.059" style="s2">when you&#39;re 40 so then you take people</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:48.200" style="s2">out you say well what are you afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.059" end="00:27:49.970" style="s2">ranked it from 1 to 10 so 10 is make a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.200" end="00:27:51.470" style="s2">list of 10 things you&#39;re afraid of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.970" end="00:27:53.659" style="s2">least the thing you&#39;re least afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.470" end="00:27:53.960" style="s2">will call number 10 so we&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.659" end="00:27:56.299" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.960" end="00:27:57.950" style="s2">okay well I&#39;m afraid of elevators okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.299" end="00:28:01.129" style="s2">well let&#39;s let&#39;s look at a picture of an</p>

<p begin="00:28:01.129" end="00:28:05.240" style="s2">an elevator let&#39;s go out to an elevator</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.139" end="00:28:07.250" style="s2">and let you watch the terrible jaws of</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.710" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">find out you go do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.730" end="00:28:21.080" style="s2">it works you&#39;re nervous as hell</p>

<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">multiple times is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.570" end="00:29:09.580" style="s2">if you run someone through an exposure</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:11.830" style="s2">training process like that and toughen</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.580" end="00:29:13.180" style="s2">them up they&#39;ll often start standing up</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.180" end="00:30:31.930" style="s2">and it&#39;s completely understandable but</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.950" end="00:30:33.550" style="s2">the problem with it is is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.930" end="00:30:36.220" style="s2">more to you than you think and so if you</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.380" end="00:30:58.330" style="s2">certainly possible and it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:01.180" style="s2">abstract question it&#39;s exactly the sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.330" end="00:31:03.160" style="s2">of question that you address in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.180" end="00:31:04.840" style="s2">psychotherapeutic process it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.160" end="00:31:07.180" style="s2">always the question that you address and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.840" end="00:31:09.010" style="s2">the answer is often in the affirmative</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.180" end="00:31:11.140" style="s2">because people can get unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.010" end="00:31:13.630" style="s2">tough and you know that because people</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.140" end="00:31:16.120" style="s2">work in emergency wards and hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.630" end="00:31:17.890" style="s2">right or they work in in palliative care</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.120" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">Awards or they work as March</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.890" end="00:31:22.180" style="s2">very assistants I mean these people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:24.070" style="s2">bloody rough jobs you know or they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.180" end="00:31:25.570" style="s2">the front line of police investigation</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.070" end="00:31:27.460" style="s2">into you know highness</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.570" end="00:31:29.410" style="s2">child abuse crimes and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.460" end="00:31:30.790" style="s2">confronting malevolence on a regular</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.410" end="00:31:34.050" style="s2">basis and you know those are very</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.790" end="00:31:36.670" style="s2">stressful jobs but people do them and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.050" end="00:31:39.160" style="s2">some people do them without even being</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.670" end="00:31:40.510" style="s2">damaged by them although that&#39;s a harder</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.160" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">thing because you can see horrible</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.510" end="00:31:46.780" style="s2">things you know things you&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">forget so so I would say the the story</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.780" end="00:31:52.420" style="s2">in the story of Adam and Eve is a meta</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:53.020" style="s2">story and it&#39;s a meta story for two</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.420" end="00:31:56.020" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.020" end="00:31:57.640" style="s2">one is it&#39;s about how stories transform</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.020" end="00:31:59.050" style="s2">because Adam and Eve are in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.640" end="00:32:01.420" style="s2">unconscious paradise and then it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.050" end="00:32:03.880" style="s2">collapses and that happens to every</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.420" end="00:32:06.250" style="s2">potential story right that&#39;s Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.880" end="00:32:08.230" style="s2">realization he said look imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.250" end="00:32:10.030" style="s2">you live within a belief system and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.230" end="00:32:12.910" style="s2">something arises to challenge the belief</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.030" end="00:32:15.010" style="s2">system not only does the belief system</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.910" end="00:32:17.620" style="s2">collapse but something worse happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.010" end="00:32:19.540" style="s2">your belief in belief systems collapses</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.620" end="00:32:21.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s the road tonight now it</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.540" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to because you can jump</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.130" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">from one belief system to another but</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:27.160" style="s2">sometimes that doesn&#39;t work is that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:29.050" style="s2">do a meta critique and you say oh I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.160" end="00:32:31.690" style="s2">living in this protective structure and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.050" end="00:32:32.920" style="s2">it turned out to be flawed okay one</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.690" end="00:32:35.590" style="s2">alternative is jumped to another</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.920" end="00:32:37.450" style="s2">protective structure fine another</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.590" end="00:32:39.370" style="s2">alternative is protective structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.450" end="00:32:41.530" style="s2">themselves are not to be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.370" end="00:32:43.180" style="s2">bang you&#39;re in chaos how the hell are</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.530" end="00:32:46.180" style="s2">you going to get out of that that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:32:46.180" end="00:32:50.500" style="s2">you can work your way through that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.010" end="00:32:52.870" style="s2">that&#39;s difficult or you can do what Jung</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.500" end="00:32:55.090" style="s2">would regard as a soul damaging move and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.870" end="00:32:57.850" style="s2">you can sacrifice your new knowledge</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.740" end="00:33:04.420" style="s2">happening to some degree with the people</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.420" end="00:33:12.340" style="s2">to to the current state of chaos it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.850" end="00:33:14.890" style="s2">like I know that people need to identify</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.340" end="00:33:17.170" style="s2">with local groups I understand that but</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.890" end="00:33:19.570" style="s2">that they risk the danger of making the</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.570" end="00:33:22.750" style="s2">but that&#39;s not a good replacement for</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.830" end="00:34:34.420" style="s2">paradoxical suggestion is that well why</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.290" end="00:34:35.920" style="s2">does it work well because the more you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.420" end="00:34:38.020" style="s2">confront the two of them the more you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.920" end="00:34:39.790" style="s2">grow and maybe you can grow so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.020" end="00:34:41.710" style="s2">you&#39;re actually larger than the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.790" end="00:34:43.090" style="s2">and malevolence itself and you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.710" end="00:34:46.300" style="s2">well what&#39;s the evidence for that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.090" end="00:34:48.190" style="s2">that&#39;s easy that&#39;s what people do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.300" end="00:34:50.350" style="s2">is how we learn like every time you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.190" end="00:34:51.160" style="s2">expose your child to something new a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.350" end="00:34:54.060" style="s2">playground</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.160" end="00:34:56.110" style="s2">what are they exposed to chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.060" end="00:34:58.180" style="s2">malevolence now there&#39;s more to it than</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.110" end="00:34:59.980" style="s2">that obviously because kids play and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.180" end="00:35:01.480" style="s2">they you know they promote each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.980" end="00:35:03.670" style="s2">and they form friendships and all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.480" end="00:35:05.590" style="s2">that but in the playground itself there</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.670" end="00:35:07.600" style="s2">is the complexity of the social</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.590" end="00:35:09.850" style="s2">structure and the malevolence of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.600" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">bully it&#39;s right there and that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.850" end="00:35:14.050" style="s2">throw your kid in there and you say</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:16.870" style="s2">adapt and they do okay so they can do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.050" end="00:35:18.790" style="s2">at a small scale it&#39;s not trivial the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.870" end="00:35:21.370" style="s2">playground is a complicated place the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.790" end="00:35:23.890" style="s2">kid can adapt well how much can you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.370" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">scale that up can you scale that up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.890" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">from the chaos and order and malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:32.980" style="s2">of the playground to chaos and order and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:33.460" style="s2">malevolence itself well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.980" end="00:35:35.500" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.460" end="00:35:38.710" style="s2">well I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.500" end="00:35:40.030" style="s2">answer that in the negative so because</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.710" end="00:35:42.250" style="s2">we don&#39;t know the full extent of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.030" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2">human being and it is the problem that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.250" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">worked out so in the Buddhist story for</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:47.430" style="s2">example what</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">happens after so buddha&#39;s world</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.430" end="00:35:51.089" style="s2">collapses in the same way that Adam and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:54.029" style="s2">Eve&#39;s world collapses it&#39;s a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.089" end="00:35:55.710" style="s2">of repetitive exposure to mortality and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.029" end="00:35:58.890" style="s2">death what happens to Buddhas he</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.710" end="00:36:01.259" style="s2">realizes that the little protected city</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.890" end="00:36:03.240" style="s2">that his father made for him the walled</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.259" end="00:36:05.490" style="s2">garden it&#39;s exactly the same motif</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.240" end="00:36:11.400" style="s2">that&#39;s in this Adam and Eve story is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.490" end="00:36:13.319" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s what it&#39;s fatally flawed that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.400" end="00:36:15.720" style="s2">kind of protection cannot exist and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.319" end="00:36:17.369" style="s2">discovers that in pieces right which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.720" end="00:36:19.619" style="s2">exactly what happens to children is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.369" end="00:36:22.019" style="s2">they go out they discover a limit they</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.619" end="00:36:23.279" style="s2">run back and the parents can help them</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.019" end="00:36:25.589" style="s2">with the limit they run out they</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.279" end="00:36:27.539" style="s2">discover limit they run back but some at</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.589" end="00:36:29.160" style="s2">some point they run out they discover a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.539" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">limit they run back and the parents have</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.160" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">nothing to say to them because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.319" style="s2">hit the same limit that the parents hit</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:36.180" style="s2">which is like well what are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.319" end="00:36:37.650" style="s2">do with your life how are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.180" end="00:36:39.779" style="s2">how are you going to operate in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.650" end="00:36:41.849" style="s2">archetypal universe while your parents</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.779" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">can only say well they can say you</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.849" end="00:36:45.569" style="s2">identify with the proper archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.400" style="s2">figures they do that they at least act</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.569" end="00:36:49.559" style="s2">that out for you but at some point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.400" end="00:36:52.710" style="s2">a problem that they cannot solve for you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.559" end="00:36:54.900" style="s2">without making you weaker that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.710" end="00:36:56.670" style="s2">thing you know so it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.900" end="00:36:58.410" style="s2">thing that I&#39;ve learned in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.670" end="00:37:01.890" style="s2">because one of the things you have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.410" end="00:37:03.720" style="s2">learn as a therapist is how do you not</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.890" end="00:37:07.499" style="s2">take your clients problems home with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.720" end="00:37:09.749" style="s2">it&#39;s a very common existential problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.499" end="00:37:11.039" style="s2">that beginning therapists face because</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.749" end="00:37:12.450" style="s2">they&#39;re afraid it&#39;s like while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.039" end="00:37:14.009" style="s2">dealing with people all the time you</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.450" end="00:37:16.049" style="s2">have serious problems sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.009" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">mental illness although less frequently</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.049" end="00:37:19.829" style="s2">than you&#39;d think and sometimes it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:22.349" style="s2">that they&#39;re having a good catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.829" end="00:37:23.640" style="s2">right there their parents have cancer or</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.349" end="00:37:25.170" style="s2">something like that or the father has</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.640" end="00:37:27.230" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s and they&#39;re unemployed they</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.170" end="00:37:29.819" style="s2">have a drug problem or they have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.230" end="00:37:31.739" style="s2">schizophrenic son or like these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.819" end="00:37:33.749" style="s2">mental illness problems right those are</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.739" end="00:37:35.700" style="s2">just catastrophes and so people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.749" end="00:37:37.950" style="s2">discussing those with you all the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.700" end="00:37:39.960" style="s2">how do you avoid being crushed by that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.950" end="00:37:41.849" style="s2">or avoid taking at home and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.960" end="00:37:44.489" style="s2">to that is you don&#39;t steal the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.849" end="00:37:47.339" style="s2">that that&#39;s the answer it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.489" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">have some problems if you come and talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.339" end="00:37:51.210" style="s2">to me I&#39;ll help you figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:53.819" style="s2">solve them I will not tell you how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.210" end="00:37:55.769" style="s2">solve I won&#39;t steal your problems</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.819" end="00:37:57.989" style="s2">because what we&#39;re trying to do in</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.769" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">therapy is number one solve your problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.989" end="00:38:00.870" style="s2">number</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:03.480" style="s2">to turn you into a great solver of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.870" end="00:38:05.340" style="s2">problems and the second one is way more</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.480" end="00:38:08.070" style="s2">important than the first one and so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.340" end="00:38:10.080" style="s2">never solve someone&#39;s problem by</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.070" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">removing from them the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.080" end="00:38:14.220" style="s2">solve their problem that&#39;s theft</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:15.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the eatable situation that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.940" end="00:38:21.930" style="s2">play that rule too we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.650" end="00:38:23.700" style="s2">archetypal representations like I&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.700" end="00:38:29.700" style="s2">to protect yourself no wrong that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.960" end="00:38:32.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a sin that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.700" end="00:38:33.900" style="s2">thinking about that is not what you do</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.100" end="00:38:36.390" style="s2">with people not with your children not</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.900" end="00:38:38.790" style="s2">with your partner not with yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.390" end="00:38:41.880" style="s2">don&#39;t do that that destroys people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.790" end="00:38:44.520" style="s2">adaptive competence and it disarms them</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.880" end="00:38:46.770" style="s2">in the face of chaos and malevolence and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.520" end="00:38:49.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrible unisen someone oh darn</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.770" end="00:38:52.440" style="s2">armed in the world like that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.050" end="00:38:53.850" style="s2">terrible thing to do so and if people</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.440" end="00:38:55.470" style="s2">aren&#39;t strong enough to manage it then</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.850" end="00:38:57.000" style="s2">they get resentful and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.470" end="00:38:59.880" style="s2">when you get the downhill spiral that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.000" end="00:39:03.300" style="s2">goes along with that okay so the meta</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.880" end="00:39:05.370" style="s2">story is partly you&#39;re in a mat you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.300" end="00:39:06.780" style="s2">you have a map but it&#39;s insufficient and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.370" end="00:39:09.110" style="s2">things will come up to disrupt it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.780" end="00:39:11.550" style="s2">sometimes the disruption is catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.110" end="00:39:13.050" style="s2">everything falls apart that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.550" end="00:39:14.820" style="s2">happens to the Buddha and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.050" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">happens to Adam and Eve and the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.820" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">the biblical stories are actually an</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:21.630" style="s2">attempt to put that back together now</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s being assembled as I said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.630" end="00:39:27.060" style="s2">been assembled over centuries right okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:29.820" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the problem the problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.060" end="00:39:32.580" style="s2">apocalypse the ever-present reality of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.820" end="00:39:34.470" style="s2">the apocalyptic fall that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.580" end="00:39:36.450" style="s2">and so you could say well what is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.470" end="00:39:39.990" style="s2">it&#39;s the insufficiency of all potential</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.450" end="00:39:41.760" style="s2">conceptual schemes right your conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.990" end="00:39:43.230" style="s2">schemes are insufficient to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.760" end="00:39:45.780" style="s2">the complexity of the world it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.230" end="00:39:47.700" style="s2">permanent problem so what do you do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.780" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">stop relying on your conceptual schemes</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.700" end="00:39:52.620" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the answer you start</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.770" end="00:39:55.350" style="s2">relying on your instead on your ability</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.620" end="00:39:58.260" style="s2">to actively generate conceptual schemes</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.910" end="00:40:16.349" style="s2">territory and that it not and that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.579" end="00:40:18.180" style="s2">idea is that that elevates your</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.349" end="00:40:19.890" style="s2">character to the point where you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.180" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">withstand tragedy and malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.890" end="00:40:24.150" style="s2">without becoming corrupt and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:26.220" style="s2">provides a permanent solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.150" end="00:40:28.680" style="s2">problem well then you might say</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.220" end="00:40:30.839" style="s2">cynically what&#39;s your evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.680" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">that&#39;s a permanent solution an answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.839" end="00:40:35.819" style="s2">that is while the evidence isn&#39;t all in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:38.549" style="s2">yet first of all because people only</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.819" end="00:40:40.619" style="s2">live that way partially and so we</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.549" end="00:40:43.559" style="s2">haven&#39;t put the hypothesis to the full</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.619" end="00:40:45.569" style="s2">test and second we don&#39;t know what our</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.559" end="00:40:48.210" style="s2">limitations are we have no idea what our</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.569" end="00:40:50.190" style="s2">limitations are and they&#39;re they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.210" end="00:40:51.720" style="s2">greater and lesser than we imagined</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.190" end="00:40:54.859" style="s2">because you you know you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.720" end="00:40:57.180" style="s2">yourself like if people stopped adding</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.859" end="00:40:59.849" style="s2">voluntarily to the misery of the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.180" end="00:41:01.530" style="s2">and devoted themselves to setting things</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.849" end="00:41:02.789" style="s2">straight setting themselves straight and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.530" end="00:41:05.940" style="s2">setting the things around them straight</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.789" end="00:41:08.430" style="s2">what would happen and the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.940" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">is well there&#39;d be a hell of a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.430" end="00:41:12.510" style="s2">unnecessary misery in the world so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:14.369" style="s2">might not be a bad place to start but</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.510" end="00:41:16.950" style="s2">apart from that there&#39;s very little that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.369" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">we can say could we overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.950" end="00:41:21.559" style="s2">catastrophe of mortality why not</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:23.940" style="s2">you think that&#39;s beyond our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.559" end="00:41:25.230" style="s2">could we make the world a place where no</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.940" end="00:41:27.299" style="s2">one was suffering any more than</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.230" end="00:41:30.089" style="s2">necessary and still allow the world to</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.299" end="00:41:31.740" style="s2">exist well possibly because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.089" end="00:41:34.859" style="s2">know the limitations of our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.740" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">we&#39;re only running at 40 percent if that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.859" end="00:41:38.789" style="s2">I would say we don&#39;t make full use of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.640" style="s2">all the people that are in the world we</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.789" end="00:41:44.099" style="s2">don&#39;t have our situation set up so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.640" end="00:41:47.039" style="s2">the gifts that they could offer to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.099" end="00:41:49.140" style="s2">everyone are fully realized we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.039" end="00:41:51.420" style="s2">set the systems up for that yet so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.140" end="00:41:54.529" style="s2">waste people like mad and then we waste</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.420" end="00:41:57.180" style="s2">ourselves like mad and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.529" end="00:41:57.900" style="s2">this is something also that&#39;s it one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.180" end="00:42:00.390" style="s2">the things that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.900" end="00:42:01.740" style="s2">about the Old Testament Jews this is I</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.390" end="00:42:04.200" style="s2">think one of the reasons that their book</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.740" end="00:42:06.930" style="s2">has become so central is because what</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.200" end="00:42:09.029" style="s2">happens in the Old Testament after the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.930" end="00:42:11.880" style="s2">fall is that Israel produces a series of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.029" end="00:42:13.470" style="s2">states right rise of state and then a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.880" end="00:42:15.000" style="s2">fall and then a rise of another state</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.470" end="00:42:16.349" style="s2">and then a fall so it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.000" end="00:42:19.319" style="s2">except it&#39;s happening at a political</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.349" end="00:42:21.990" style="s2">level the political state rises it gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.319" end="00:42:24.299" style="s2">corrupt it falls it rises out of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.990" end="00:42:25.420" style="s2">ashes again gets corrupt and Falls I</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.299" end="00:42:27.130" style="s2">think that happen</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.420" end="00:42:28.809" style="s2">times in the Old Testament and one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.130" end="00:42:31.930" style="s2">the things that&#39;s very interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.809" end="00:42:34.930" style="s2">the reaction of the Jews they always say</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.930" end="00:42:36.460" style="s2">it was our fault instead of taking the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.930" end="00:42:37.809" style="s2">Cain and Abel roots oh and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.460" end="00:42:39.700" style="s2">tell you the Cain and Abel story right</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.809" end="00:42:41.380" style="s2">away instead of taking the Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.700" end="00:42:43.240" style="s2">route they always say if the state</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.380" end="00:42:44.950" style="s2">collapsed it was because we did</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.240" end="00:42:47.890" style="s2">something wrong that&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.950" end="00:42:50.140" style="s2">than saying you know it&#39;s arbitrary fate</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.890" end="00:42:52.630" style="s2">it&#39;s the nature of arbitrary fate or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.140" end="00:42:56.730" style="s2">structure of reality that we&#39;re doomed</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.630" end="00:42:59.549" style="s2">to collapse into chaos and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.730" end="00:43:01.900" style="s2">indication of the corruption of being</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.549" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">well you can take that route if you want</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.900" end="00:43:05.410" style="s2">it&#39;s the corruption of being well good</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:06.940" style="s2">luck with that so what are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.410" end="00:43:09.250" style="s2">do about that that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.940" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">start you&#39;ll start to work for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.250" end="00:43:13.480" style="s2">destruction of being that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:15.460" style="s2">will do the alternative is to say this</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.480" end="00:43:18.670" style="s2">terrible thing happened and somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.460" end="00:43:20.500" style="s2">my fault well at least that ly opens you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.670" end="00:43:22.089" style="s2">up the pathway to doing something about</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.500" end="00:43:24.010" style="s2">it and maybe it&#39;s actually the case</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.089" end="00:43:26.710" style="s2">maybe terrible things happen because</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.010" end="00:43:28.210" style="s2">you&#39;re just not who you should be at</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.710" end="00:43:30.790" style="s2">least it&#39;s a night you know that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.210" end="00:43:32.109" style="s2">to some degree right you know it because</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.790" end="00:43:33.910" style="s2">things happen to you all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.109" end="00:43:35.260" style="s2">you think well you know if I just would</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.910" end="00:43:36.819" style="s2">have played that game straight if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.260" end="00:43:38.530" style="s2">would have put this thing in order that</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.819" end="00:43:41.049" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have happened it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.530" end="00:43:43.990" style="s2">fine what&#39;s the ultimate extent of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.049" end="00:43:45.849" style="s2">das esq said at one point that every</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.990" end="00:43:47.380" style="s2">human being was not only responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.849" end="00:43:50.140" style="s2">everything that happened to him or her</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.380" end="00:43:51.400" style="s2">but also simultaneously responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.140" end="00:43:54.730" style="s2">everything that happened to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.400" end="00:43:57.069" style="s2">else it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.730" end="00:43:59.650" style="s2">almost a hallucinogenic idea right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.069" end="00:44:02.020" style="s2">a it&#39;s a transcendent idea and it can go</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.650" end="00:44:05.020" style="s2">very wrong sometimes depressed people</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.020" end="00:44:07.030" style="s2">for example get hyper responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.020" end="00:44:09.220" style="s2">what&#39;s happened and just crushes them</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.030" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a mode of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.220" end="00:44:13.030" style="s2">that can produce its attendant</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.200" end="00:44:16.390" style="s2">pathologies but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.030" end="00:44:19.809" style="s2">it that&#39;s there&#39;s something about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.390" end="00:44:20.859" style="s2">that&#39;s metaphysically true so all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.809" end="00:44:22.930" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to tell you the story of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.859" end="00:44:25.690" style="s2">Cain and Abel now I really like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.930" end="00:44:27.280" style="s2">story it&#39;s it&#39;s very short it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.690" end="00:44:29.079" style="s2">about a paragraph long which is very</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.280" end="00:44:32.260" style="s2">interesting because it it&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.079" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">examples where there&#39;s a it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.260" end="00:44:36.790" style="s2">genie that the story there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:38.319" style="s2">condensed into it that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.790" end="00:44:40.569" style="s2">unbelievable and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.319" end="00:44:41.859" style="s2">there&#39;s even ambiguity condensed into it</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.569" end="00:44:43.689" style="s2">which is which is very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.859" end="00:44:45.999" style="s2">because it actually makes the story more</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.689" end="00:44:48.130" style="s2">complex and sophisticated so let me tell</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.999" end="00:44:49.509" style="s2">you the story now the first thing I want</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.130" end="00:44:51.130" style="s2">to tell you some things about the story</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.509" end="00:44:52.989" style="s2">first so we&#39;ve got the original</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.130" end="00:44:56.529" style="s2">paradisal state and then the collapse</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.989" end="00:44:58.599" style="s2">and so now metaphysically speaking we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.529" end="00:45:00.669" style="s2">in the collapse we&#39;re in the we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.599" end="00:45:03.099" style="s2">the post fall condition we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.669" end="00:45:04.479" style="s2">occupying a mythological landscape right</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.099" end="00:45:07.299" style="s2">this isn&#39;t history as we normally</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.479" end="00:45:09.339" style="s2">understand it it&#39;s meta history so when</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.299" end="00:45:11.650" style="s2">we talk about Cain and Abel Cain and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.339" end="00:45:15.160" style="s2">Abel we&#39;re actually talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.650" end="00:45:17.410" style="s2">first two real human beings because Adam</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.160" end="00:45:20.109" style="s2">and Eve a were created by God and being</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.410" end="00:45:22.209" style="s2">were in Paradise and so that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.109" end="00:45:24.189" style="s2">normative condition of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.209" end="00:45:26.679" style="s2">right that&#39;s a that&#39;s a special time</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.189" end="00:45:29.199" style="s2">that&#39;s outside of normal time and space</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.679" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">Cain and Abel by contrast they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.199" end="00:45:33.069" style="s2">history because in some sense history</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:34.809" style="s2">actually starts a couple of times in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.069" end="00:45:36.759" style="s2">Old Testament it starts with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.809" end="00:45:38.769" style="s2">creation of being it starts with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.759" end="00:45:40.869" style="s2">formation of the garden it starts with</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.769" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">the fall it starts with Cain and Abel it</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.869" end="00:45:44.739" style="s2">starts it over again with Noah and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:46.839" style="s2">it starts with Abraham which is really</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.739" end="00:45:49.959" style="s2">where what we would recognize more as</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.839" end="00:45:51.759" style="s2">conventional history begins so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.959" end="00:45:53.380" style="s2">number of starts of history but this is</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.600" end="00:47:20.590" style="s2">this is partly why the story of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.670" end="00:47:22.840" style="s2">is archetypal and the archetypal story</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.590" end="00:47:25.000" style="s2">is when you cannot push beyond what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.840" end="00:47:27.070" style="s2">the worst possible punishment what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:47:27.070" end="00:47:32.140" style="s2">the least the least the most innocent</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.070" end="00:47:35.320" style="s2">person you hit an archetypal end there</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.140" end="00:47:36.460" style="s2">so you define most innocent person you</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.320" end="00:47:39.010" style="s2">can do that any way you want</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.460" end="00:47:41.260" style="s2">define most innocent person define worst</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.260" end="00:47:44.950" style="s2">things you get an archetypal story and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.330" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">the reason for that is you can&#39;t push</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.950" end="00:47:49.990" style="s2">beyond it and so if you want to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:52.660" style="s2">something you want to destroy an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.990" end="00:47:55.020" style="s2">not something that&#39;s flawed and so Kate</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.660" end="00:47:57.130" style="s2">and Abel are set up exactly that way so</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.020" end="00:47:59.020" style="s2">I&#39;ll read you the story and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.130" end="00:48:02.650" style="s2">interleave some interpretations along</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.020" end="00:48:05.950" style="s2">with it so an atom anew Eve his wife and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.650" end="00:48:08.200" style="s2">she conceived and bore Cain and said I</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.950" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">have got the man from the Lord and she</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.200" end="00:48:13.510" style="s2">again bare his brother Abel and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:14.760" style="s2">with the keeper of sheep but Cain was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.510" end="00:48:18.670" style="s2">tiller of the ground</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.760" end="00:48:22.120" style="s2">okay so Abel&#39;s a shepherd and Cain is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.670" end="00:48:24.010" style="s2">farmer the Shepherd is a archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.120" end="00:48:26.290" style="s2">symbol because the Shepherd is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.010" end="00:48:28.120" style="s2">leader of a flock and the Shepherd is</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.290" end="00:48:29.590" style="s2">the heroic leader of a flock and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.120" end="00:48:31.630" style="s2">reasons this is Middle Eastern mythology</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.590" end="00:48:33.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say well if you were a shepherd</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.630" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">what did you do you took your slingshot</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.640" end="00:48:38.650" style="s2">in your stick and you defended your nice</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:41.740" style="s2">juicy plump delicious sheep against</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.650" end="00:48:43.450" style="s2">lions right so it was no joke man you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.740" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">you were a tough cookie if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.450" end="00:48:49.090" style="s2">shepherd because while you were acting</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">as the guardian of that you&#39;re acting as</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.090" end="00:48:52.690" style="s2">the Guardian against predation roughly</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:55.120" style="s2">speaking and you weren&#39;t armed very well</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.690" end="00:48:57.070" style="s2">I mean well you can just think about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.120" end="00:48:59.050" style="s2">for a minute it&#39;s to think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.070" end="00:49:00.970" style="s2">fighting off a lion with a with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.050" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">slingshot or with a bow and arrow with a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.970" end="00:49:04.610" style="s2">spear I mean you have to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:07.310" style="s2">courage to manage that</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.610" end="00:49:09.140" style="s2">especially successfully so Abel was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.310" end="00:49:10.910" style="s2">keeper of sheep and Cain was a tiller of</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.140" end="00:49:14.660" style="s2">the ground which isn&#39;t as heroic to roll</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.910" end="00:49:16.610" style="s2">and so right off the bat you get this</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:18.440" style="s2">dichotomy between the two roles it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.610" end="00:49:20.570" style="s2">also a great interest that Cain is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.440" end="00:49:22.100" style="s2">older brother and Abel is the younger</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.570" end="00:49:23.660" style="s2">brother and you see that very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.100" end="00:49:25.400" style="s2">in mythology because the older brother</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.660" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">is the one that&#39;s privileged by status</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.400" end="00:49:30.980" style="s2">right so he&#39;s got he&#39;s got privilege</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:33.560" style="s2">Cain because he&#39;s the elder brother that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.980" end="00:49:35.480" style="s2">also means that if there are possessions</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.560" end="00:49:37.550" style="s2">to be handed down the generations the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.480" end="00:49:40.070" style="s2">older brother gets them now</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.550" end="00:49:41.570" style="s2">interestingly enough Cain has privileged</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.070" end="00:49:44.050" style="s2">but he&#39;s not the one that&#39;s favored by</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.570" end="00:49:46.040" style="s2">God that&#39;s and I think that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.050" end="00:49:48.740" style="s2">absolutely brilliant that it&#39;s set up</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.040" end="00:49:50.450" style="s2">that way because it&#39;s actually Abel who</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.740" end="00:49:52.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the right that the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.450" end="00:49:54.890" style="s2">Lord has who actually turns into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.520" end="00:49:57.350" style="s2">person who&#39;s the proper manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.890" end="00:49:58.760" style="s2">the ideal it&#39;s because Cain has things</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.350" end="00:50:00.710" style="s2">given to him you might think well that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.760" end="00:50:02.780" style="s2">that&#39;s great he&#39;s privileged what a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.710" end="00:50:05.090" style="s2">wonderful thing for Cain it&#39;s like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.780" end="00:50:06.650" style="s2">be so sure about that and partly because</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.090" end="00:50:08.750" style="s2">one of the things that you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.650" end="00:50:10.820" style="s2">because many of you will be well off</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.750" end="00:50:12.770" style="s2">when you have children is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.820" end="00:50:14.330" style="s2">problems with being reasonably wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.770" end="00:50:17.870" style="s2">when you have children is that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.330" end="00:50:19.610" style="s2">deprive them of privation because the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.870" end="00:50:23.390" style="s2">law of what makes people mature is</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.610" end="00:50:24.530" style="s2">necessity and if you have for example if</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.390" end="00:50:26.840" style="s2">you have more money than you know what</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.530" end="00:50:28.910" style="s2">to do with roughly speaking it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.840" end="00:50:31.340" style="s2">difficult to say no to your children</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.910" end="00:50:33.350" style="s2">when they want something because why are</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.340" end="00:50:36.080" style="s2">you going to say no you can just provide</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.350" end="00:50:37.850" style="s2">it well what makes you think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.080" end="00:50:40.280" style="s2">what you should do well you can have</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.850" end="00:50:42.680" style="s2">anything you want well what happens you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.280" end="00:50:45.230" style="s2">devalue what you want and your desires</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.680" end="00:50:48.170" style="s2">continue to grow well that&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.230" end="00:50:50.210" style="s2">helpful so it&#39;s not obvious at all that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.170" end="00:50:52.310" style="s2">providing people with an excess let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.210" end="00:50:53.600" style="s2">say a privilege is something that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.310" end="00:50:56.660" style="s2">for them from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.600" end="00:51:02.180" style="s2">perspective they need to hit the proper</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.660" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">limitations and if you&#39;re fortunate it</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.180" end="00:51:05.930" style="s2">becomes very difficult to deprive your</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:07.610" style="s2">children properly so you&#39;ll you&#39;ll fight</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.930" end="00:51:08.990" style="s2">with that it&#39;s a big problem that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.610" end="00:51:11.420" style="s2">happens when you get spoiled children</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.990" end="00:51:12.770" style="s2">roughly speaking right they get every</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.420" end="00:51:15.470" style="s2">they get everything by doing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.770" end="00:51:17.470" style="s2">well that&#39;s not a good lesson because</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.470" end="00:51:19.890" style="s2">that won&#39;t work in the world it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.470" end="00:51:22.810" style="s2">worked very counterproductive leigh-anne</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.890" end="00:51:25.090" style="s2">in process of time it came to pass that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.810" end="00:51:27.400" style="s2">Cain brought of the fruit of the ground</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.090" end="00:51:29.050" style="s2">an offering unto the Lord and Abel he</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.400" end="00:51:31.090" style="s2">also brought of the firstlings of his</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.050" end="00:51:32.859" style="s2">flock and of the fat thereof and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.090" end="00:51:34.720" style="s2">Lord had respect unto Abel and his</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.859" end="00:51:37.390" style="s2">offering but unto Cain and his offering</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.720" end="00:51:40.300" style="s2">he had no respect and Cain was very</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.390" end="00:51:42.430" style="s2">wroth angry and his countenance fell</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.300" end="00:51:44.440" style="s2">okay so again there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.430" end="00:51:46.810" style="s2">amount packed into that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.440" end="00:51:49.570" style="s2">first time that we see the motif of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.810" end="00:51:51.730" style="s2">sacrifice right and so I mentioned to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.570" end="00:51:53.650" style="s2">you before how these archaic people</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.650" end="00:52:00.250" style="s2">dome with a disc of land and underneath</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.210" end="00:52:01.840" style="s2">that a disc of water fresh and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.250" end="00:52:04.599" style="s2">underneath that a disc of salt water so</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.840" end="00:52:07.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the world and then up in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.599" end="00:52:09.130" style="s2">heavens that&#39;s where God is and so God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.090" end="00:52:11.020" style="s2">up in the sky and we talked about why</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.130" end="00:52:13.090" style="s2">that might be and part of that is well</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.020" end="00:52:15.730" style="s2">when you look at the night sky you look</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.090" end="00:52:18.940" style="s2">at what transcends your current reality</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.730" end="00:52:21.550" style="s2">and you look at what inspires awe so</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.940" end="00:52:24.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a God exists where awe is</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.550" end="00:52:25.859" style="s2">experienced fine that&#39;s a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.010" end="00:52:27.849" style="s2">reasonable that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.859" end="00:52:29.530" style="s2">hypothesis when you think that what</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.849" end="00:52:31.660" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is formulate what</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.530" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">constitutes the transcendent because if</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.660" end="00:52:36.280" style="s2">you exist within a conceptual structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:38.589" style="s2">and you encounter that which is outside</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.280" end="00:52:40.780" style="s2">the conceptual structure you will feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.589" end="00:52:43.570" style="s2">off that&#39;s a combination of fear</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.780" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">paralysis right and the combination of</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.570" end="00:52:47.410" style="s2">overwhelming possibility and you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.450" style="s2">experience that for example if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.410" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">listen to a great piece of music what</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.450" end="00:52:54.250" style="s2">happens the hair on the back of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:56.320" style="s2">neck stands up why because you&#39;re a prey</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.250" end="00:52:57.910" style="s2">animal and you just puffed up to look</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.320" end="00:53:00.010" style="s2">bigger that&#39;s why you have that</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.910" end="00:53:03.220" style="s2">experiences pile of erection and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.010" end="00:53:04.900" style="s2">part of awe so when you see a cat pop up</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.220" end="00:53:06.520" style="s2">because a big dog is in front of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.900" end="00:53:10.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what the cats feeling it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.520" end="00:53:12.339" style="s2">oh my god pop right so you when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.599" end="00:53:15.010" style="s2">encounter that which transcends your</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.339" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">your limited sphere of apprehension then</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.010" end="00:53:18.550" style="s2">you experience aw you look at the night</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:20.410" style="s2">sky that&#39;s what happens music can do</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.550" end="00:53:24.130" style="s2">that and all sorts of things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.410" end="00:53:27.070" style="s2">can evoke that sense and so they located</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.130" end="00:53:30.520" style="s2">the transcendent value in that which</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.070" end="00:53:31.180" style="s2">inspired awe fight reasonable now you</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.520" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">can argue</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.180" end="00:53:36.010" style="s2">about the utility of the personification</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:38.140" style="s2">right because God the Father was</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.010" end="00:53:40.119" style="s2">personified in human form but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.140" end="00:53:42.460" style="s2">very sophisticated idea too because as</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.119" end="00:53:44.710" style="s2">we already found in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.460" end="00:53:47.500" style="s2">there&#39;s an there&#39;s an association</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.710" end="00:53:51.069" style="s2">between whatever God is yahwah or Elohim</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.500" end="00:53:53.290" style="s2">and and creating order out of chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.069" end="00:53:55.329" style="s2">something about each individual human</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.290" end="00:53:57.970" style="s2">being and so I don&#39;t believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.329" end="00:54:00.250" style="s2">personification of God the Father in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.970" end="00:54:02.619" style="s2">Old Testament is archaic and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.250" end="00:54:04.119" style="s2">primitive at all I think it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.619" end="00:54:06.550" style="s2">most sophisticated things that people</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.119" end="00:54:08.530" style="s2">ever developed the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.550" end="00:54:10.839" style="s2">ultimate transcendent value is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.530" end="00:54:13.809" style="s2">capacity to generate order out of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.839" end="00:54:16.119" style="s2">using linguistic ability let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.809" end="00:54:17.859" style="s2">that each person has that as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.119" end="00:54:20.260" style="s2">essential element of their being like</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.859" end="00:54:21.720" style="s2">argue with that see how far you get that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.260" end="00:54:23.589" style="s2">is one hell of a vicious</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.720" end="00:54:25.540" style="s2">conceptualization and I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.589" end="00:54:28.150" style="s2">it&#39;s the bedrock upon which our legal</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.540" end="00:54:30.280" style="s2">system rests so you don&#39;t move that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.150" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">easily you move that and many things</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.280" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">fall and there are things that you may</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:36.069" style="s2">say you don&#39;t believe but you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:38.049" style="s2">out all the time in fact if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.069" end="00:54:39.970" style="s2">act them out people would set you</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.049" end="00:54:42.069" style="s2">straight very very rapidly because</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.970" end="00:54:44.020" style="s2">basically what other people want from</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.069" end="00:54:45.880" style="s2">you even though they don&#39;t conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.020" end="00:54:48.579" style="s2">it in this terms is that you Accord them</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.880" end="00:54:50.980" style="s2">the respect due the the incarnation of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.579" end="00:54:53.319" style="s2">the logos that&#39;s exactly what it means</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.980" end="00:54:55.299" style="s2">to interact with someone properly so</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.319" end="00:54:57.099" style="s2">it&#39;s you can say what you want about</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.299" end="00:55:00.599" style="s2">what you believe it doesn&#39;t matter what</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.099" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">matters is what you act out all right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.599" end="00:55:06.549" style="s2">also now we have this conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:08.859" style="s2">of what&#39;s transcendent that&#39;s emerged as</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.549" end="00:55:11.170" style="s2">a part partially perhaps as emotional</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.859" end="00:55:13.089" style="s2">contagion that which inspires awe is</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.170" end="00:55:14.920" style="s2">that which is transcendent and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.089" end="00:55:16.869" style="s2">associated with these underlying ideas</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.920" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">about the creation of order out of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.869" end="00:55:20.020" style="s2">and the instantiation of that spirit in</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:21.700" style="s2">human beings</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.020" end="00:55:24.069" style="s2">that&#39;s all lurking in the background and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.700" end="00:55:25.960" style="s2">then we have this other idea which we</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.069" end="00:55:28.599" style="s2">already talked about which is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.960" end="00:55:30.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a patriarchal or paternal spirit</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.599" end="00:55:32.380" style="s2">that represents the community at large</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.369" end="00:55:33.670" style="s2">stretched across time you can think</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.380" end="00:55:35.980" style="s2">about that as the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.670" end="00:55:37.630" style="s2">ancestors so it&#39;s the past it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.980" end="00:55:39.819" style="s2">present but that&#39;s also projected into</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.630" end="00:55:42.190" style="s2">the future that&#39;s the thing you bargain</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.819" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">with for your life in the future I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.190" end="00:55:44.800" style="s2">going to sacrifice myself to get a</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:47.260" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.800" end="00:55:49.540" style="s2">why is that because the spirit of my</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.260" end="00:55:51.070" style="s2">culture will reward me in the future</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.540" end="00:55:53.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.070" end="00:55:55.450" style="s2">okay well took people we were</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.050" end="00:55:58.180" style="s2">chimpanzees for God&#39;s sake it took us a</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.450" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">long time to figure this out chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.180" end="00:56:01.900" style="s2">don&#39;t sacrifice the present for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:04.420" style="s2">future you know you got to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.900" end="00:56:06.520" style="s2">how long did it take human beings to</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.420" end="00:56:08.920" style="s2">figure out that there was a future and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.520" end="00:56:10.870" style="s2">then what to do about it I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.920" end="00:56:13.060" style="s2">isn&#39;t some we didn&#39;t go from chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.870" end="00:56:17.050" style="s2">to fully articulated human being in one</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.060" end="00:56:19.900" style="s2">in one step it was created knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.050" end="00:56:22.150" style="s2">that was extraordinarily painful what</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.900" end="00:56:25.000" style="s2">did we learn from observation something</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.150" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">like storing up goods for the future</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.000" end="00:56:30.520" style="s2">helps us live imagine how difficult that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:32.620" style="s2">is you know imagine that you&#39;re you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.520" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">farmer back wouldn&#39;t but that was an</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.620" end="00:56:37.090" style="s2">extraordinarily you were barely scraping</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:39.070" style="s2">out a living doing that it was hand to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.090" end="00:56:40.840" style="s2">mouth at best all right so now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.070" end="00:56:42.940" style="s2">winter and you&#39;ve got your damn seeds in</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.840" end="00:56:44.290" style="s2">your cellar right what are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.940" end="00:56:46.450" style="s2">do you&#39;re starving you&#39;re going to eat</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.290" end="00:56:48.070" style="s2">them or are you going to wait and plant</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.450" end="00:56:50.590" style="s2">them again in the spring because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.070" end="00:56:53.470" style="s2">your damn choice and so the people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.590" end="00:56:55.180" style="s2">decided to eat them well some of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.470" end="00:56:57.550" style="s2">people who decided to save them died</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.180" end="00:57:00.850" style="s2">well let&#39;s say more of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.550" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">decided to eat them died and so this</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.850" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">sort of knowledge was was gathered with</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:08.260" style="s2">an unbelievable agony you don&#39;t get what</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">what you have what you want right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.260" end="00:57:11.710" style="s2">for you that&#39;s nothing because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:13.930" style="s2">very much accustomed to getting what you</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.710" end="00:57:15.790" style="s2">want all the time right now roughly</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.930" end="00:57:18.730" style="s2">speaking you know compared to people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.790" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">live from hand to mouth but back when</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.730" end="00:57:22.900" style="s2">things were much rougher the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:25.060" style="s2">you had to sacrifice something of value</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.900" end="00:57:27.460" style="s2">now to be paid off in the future man</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.060" end="00:57:29.470" style="s2">that was a rough thing to accept okay so</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.460" end="00:57:31.240" style="s2">what happened so people figured this out</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.470" end="00:57:34.090" style="s2">somehow they figured out that you could</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.240" end="00:57:36.010" style="s2">make an offering of something you valued</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.090" end="00:57:37.840" style="s2">and that might help set the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.010" end="00:57:40.270" style="s2">straight how did they conceptualize that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.840" end="00:57:41.950" style="s2">well they conceptualize it ritually they</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.270" end="00:57:44.980" style="s2">were acting it out to begin with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.950" end="00:57:48.610" style="s2">like the PIA jetty an idea you know when</p>

<p begin="01:00:16.150" end="01:00:21.880" style="s2">you sacrifice to it well so back 4,000</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.780" end="01:00:23.320" style="s2">years ago 5,000 years ago however old</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.880" end="01:00:25.390" style="s2">this story as it&#39;s probably older than</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.320" end="01:00:27.850" style="s2">that this is the best people could do</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.390" end="01:00:29.560" style="s2">with regards to realization and they got</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.850" end="01:00:32.290" style="s2">it quite right because they also noted</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.560" end="01:00:35.400" style="s2">that God was happier if you actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.290" end="01:00:37.990" style="s2">sacrificed something of value and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.400" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a tremendous complexity and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.990" end="01:00:40.720" style="s2">idea because one of the things I could</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:42.160" style="s2">say and this is something you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.720" end="01:00:46.990" style="s2">pointed out let&#39;s say you&#39;re miserable</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:51.100" style="s2">and unhappy okay here&#39;s a cure find</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.990" end="01:00:52.150" style="s2">what&#39;s valuable and let it go so we</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.100" end="01:00:54.010" style="s2">could say well maybe it&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.150" end="01:00:56.380" style="s2">that you have maybe its relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.010" end="01:00:58.119" style="s2">with your parents right and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.380" end="01:00:59.830" style="s2">relationship is pathological but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.119" end="01:01:01.119" style="s2">locked into it you value it and no</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.830" end="01:01:02.770" style="s2">wonder because it&#39;s a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.119" end="01:01:05.580" style="s2">your parents and you&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.770" end="01:01:08.590" style="s2">terribly because of it or what do you do</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.580" end="01:01:10.540" style="s2">maybe you let it go it&#39;s a sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.590" end="01:01:13.060" style="s2">the idea is that well that will clear</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.540" end="01:01:15.070" style="s2">the future for you well very frequently</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.060" end="01:01:16.780" style="s2">when people are suffering terribly not</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.070" end="01:01:19.750" style="s2">always - sometimes you just suffer</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.780" end="01:01:22.300" style="s2">stupidly blindly and without recourse</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.750" end="01:01:24.430" style="s2">you know you get cancer and then you die</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.300" end="01:01:26.260" style="s2">so we have no idea how to deal with that</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.430" end="01:01:28.359" style="s2">but sometimes the reason that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.260" end="01:01:30.490" style="s2">suffering is because you just won&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.359" end="01:01:32.080" style="s2">go of the thing that&#39;s biting you you</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.490" end="01:01:33.430" style="s2">think well I can&#39;t let go of and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.080" end="01:01:35.080" style="s2">had clients like this I can&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.430" end="01:01:36.730" style="s2">communicating with my mother who phones</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.080" end="01:01:38.290" style="s2">me three times a day every day of my</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.730" end="01:01:40.390" style="s2">life and never says anything that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.290" end="01:01:45.730" style="s2">unbelievably critical and demeaning I</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.390" end="01:01:46.660" style="s2">can&#39;t let that go like well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.730" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">such a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.660" end="01:01:51.180" style="s2">the funny thing too often when people</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:54.130" style="s2">let something like that go it goes away</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.180" end="01:01:55.750" style="s2">sorts itself out and then comes back so</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.130" end="01:01:57.310" style="s2">they don&#39;t even end up losing it but</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.750" end="01:01:59.109" style="s2">unless they&#39;re willing to let it go to</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.310" end="01:02:01.930" style="s2">sacrifice it they make no headway</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.109" end="01:02:05.920" style="s2">whatsoever and so one of the rules is if</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.930" end="01:02:08.050" style="s2">people are impeding your development you</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.920" end="01:02:13.710" style="s2">sacrifice your relationship with them</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.050" end="01:02:13.710" style="s2">right it&#39;s a very very rough rule so</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.750" end="01:02:18.900" style="s2">in process of time it came to pass that</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.430" end="01:02:20.550" style="s2">Cain brought of the fruit of the ground</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.900" end="01:02:21.960" style="s2">an offering unto the Lord and Abel he</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.550" end="01:02:24.240" style="s2">also brought of the firstlings of his</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.960" end="01:02:26.490" style="s2">flock and of the fat thereof now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.240" end="01:02:28.440" style="s2">interesting this is this is where a</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.490" end="01:02:30.839" style="s2">close reading matters so we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.440" end="01:02:32.790" style="s2">what Cain&#39;s offering is it&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.839" end="01:02:34.980" style="s2">described but we do know something about</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.790" end="01:02:37.380" style="s2">Abel&#39;s offering and what we know is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.980" end="01:02:39.960" style="s2">by the standards of the time it&#39;s a high</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.380" end="01:02:42.329" style="s2">quality offerings so it&#39;s the firstborn</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.960" end="01:02:44.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s the fat that high-calorie right</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.329" end="01:02:47.310" style="s2">I mean you know we think of fat as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.280" end="01:02:49.829" style="s2">dietary danger but if you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.310" end="01:02:51.990" style="s2">that&#39;s really wrong right because fat is</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.829" end="01:02:53.880" style="s2">unbelievably high-calorie and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.990" end="01:02:55.530" style="s2">happening is the story points out quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.880" end="01:02:57.960" style="s2">clearly that what Abel decides to offer</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.530" end="01:02:58.680" style="s2">to God is of high quality so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.960" end="01:03:01.970" style="s2">real thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.680" end="01:03:05.069" style="s2">it&#39;s the real thing he&#39;s paying a price</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.970" end="01:03:07.890" style="s2">okay and so then it&#39;s burned well why is</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.069" end="01:03:09.300" style="s2">it burned well you know this is back</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.890" end="01:03:12.030" style="s2">again thinking from an archaic</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.300" end="01:03:13.950" style="s2">perspective well gods in the sky you</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.030" end="01:03:15.900" style="s2">can&#39;t throw your lamb up into the sky</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.950" end="01:03:17.099" style="s2">it&#39;ll just fall back down and so the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.900" end="01:03:20.940" style="s2">people knew because they&#39;ve mastered</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.099" end="01:03:22.740" style="s2">fire that smoke and savour rose and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.940" end="01:03:25.109" style="s2">you could detect the quality of an</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.740" end="01:03:27.150" style="s2">offering as a consequence of burning and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.109" end="01:03:29.460" style="s2">then that would go up in the spirit of</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.150" end="01:03:30.930" style="s2">the fire would go up to the sky and God</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.460" end="01:03:33.329" style="s2">could detect whether or not your</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.930" end="01:03:35.880" style="s2">offering was of a reasonable quality you</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.329" end="01:03:37.230" style="s2">know it&#39;s concretize obviously but you</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.880" end="01:03:39.060" style="s2">don&#39;t want to make the assumption that</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.230" end="01:03:41.880" style="s2">the people who were our forebears were</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.060" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">stupid just because they thought using</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:52.890" style="s2">you&#39;d look you can read a book like</p>

<p begin="01:03:54.810" end="01:03:59.250" style="s2">something to teach you and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.210" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">well sometimes the book isn&#39;t worth</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.250" end="01:04:03.390" style="s2">reading but if a book has been around</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:05.010" style="s2">for a very long period of time and a</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.390" end="01:04:06.359" style="s2">very large number of people have thought</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.010" end="01:04:10.890" style="s2">that perhaps there&#39;s something in it</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.359" end="01:04:12.480" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re right so and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.890" end="01:04:15.030" style="s2">tricky thing and it might also depend on</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.480" end="01:04:16.589" style="s2">how you read it but I found that this</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.030" end="01:04:18.119" style="s2">sort of investigation was a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.589" end="01:04:19.619" style="s2">useful if I started from the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.119" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">presupposition that maybe there was</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.619" end="01:04:24.869" style="s2">something I didn&#39;t know instead of you</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:27.270" style="s2">know so funny for example I taught a</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.869" end="01:04:29.339" style="s2">first year course about ten years ago on</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.270" end="01:04:30.329" style="s2">the psychology of religion it was so</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.339" end="01:04:31.529" style="s2">interesting dealing with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.329" end="01:04:33.799" style="s2">eighteen-year-old students because</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.529" end="01:04:36.569" style="s2">they&#39;re completely dismissive of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.799" end="01:04:38.910" style="s2">religious ideas and I thought God you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.569" end="01:04:40.739" style="s2">guys you don&#39;t know anything and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.910" end="01:04:42.930" style="s2">have this specific kind of blindness</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.739" end="01:04:44.969" style="s2">that a set of very intelligent social</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.930" end="01:04:47.670" style="s2">psychologists also identified which was</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.969" end="01:04:49.859" style="s2">blindness blindness because it actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.670" end="01:04:52.109" style="s2">turns out that the least the less you</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.859" end="01:04:54.089" style="s2">know about a topic the more you</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.109" end="01:04:56.309" style="s2">overestimate the quality of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.089" end="01:04:59.549" style="s2">knowledge so I thought we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.309" end="01:05:00.900" style="s2">situation where kids who don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.549" end="01:05:02.940" style="s2">how to act in the world they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.900" end="01:05:04.650" style="s2">anything will come to university and</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.940" end="01:05:06.390" style="s2">start up with the proposition that there</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.650" end="01:05:08.549" style="s2">is stood critics of judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.390" end="01:05:10.079" style="s2">culture which of which they know nothing</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.549" end="01:05:11.519" style="s2">they know nothing about it they knew</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.079" end="01:05:13.049" style="s2">nothing about history they know nothing</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.519" end="01:05:14.759" style="s2">about philosophy nothing about</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.049" end="01:05:17.519" style="s2">literature but they&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.759" end="01:05:19.319" style="s2">certain that they&#39;re correct in their in</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.519" end="01:05:21.660" style="s2">the criticisms that they&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.319" end="01:05:24.719" style="s2">forth it&#39;s absolutely unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.660" end="01:05:27.269" style="s2">so anyways and it&#39;s not helpful because</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.719" end="01:05:31.319" style="s2">then you don&#39;t you don&#39;t get to learn</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.269" end="01:05:33.269" style="s2">and you aren&#39;t well see you know what</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.319" end="01:05:35.369" style="s2">happens if you don&#39;t learn okay so</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.269" end="01:05:38.279" style="s2">anyway so it looks like Abel&#39;s doing a</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.369" end="01:05:41.069" style="s2">good job that&#39;s the implication the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.279" end="01:05:43.859" style="s2">story doesn&#39;t say Abel is doing a really</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.069" end="01:05:45.869" style="s2">good job with his sacrifices it just</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.859" end="01:05:47.999" style="s2">hints at it and I like that because</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.869" end="01:05:50.700" style="s2">because it leaves that ambiguity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.999" end="01:05:51.960" style="s2">like maybe you&#39;re working really hard</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.700" end="01:05:53.489" style="s2">and your brother&#39;s working really hard</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.960" end="01:05:55.529" style="s2">and you really can&#39;t tell the difference</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.489" end="01:05:57.690" style="s2">between your quality of work and his</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.529" end="01:06:00.359" style="s2">quality of work but for some reason he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.690" end="01:06:02.039" style="s2">succeeding like mad that happens right</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.359" end="01:06:05.539" style="s2">because there&#39;s an arbitrary element to</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.039" end="01:06:07.950" style="s2">life and so the story says well the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.539" end="01:06:10.109" style="s2">has respect unto Abel and his offering</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.950" end="01:06:11.849" style="s2">and there&#39;s an implication that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.109" end="01:06:13.289" style="s2">the reason for that is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.849" end="01:06:14.880" style="s2">Cain&#39;s offerings are a little</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.289" end="01:06:16.680" style="s2">second-rate but the story doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.880" end="01:06:19.140" style="s2">over to Club you over the head with that</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.680" end="01:06:21.150" style="s2">idea it just leaves it as a as an</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.140" end="01:06:22.950" style="s2">ambiguous possibility and the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.150" end="01:06:24.630" style="s2">that is sometimes you make sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.950" end="01:06:26.339" style="s2">and maybe they&#39;re even real ones and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.630" end="01:06:28.229" style="s2">they don&#39;t pay off or they pay off for</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.339" end="01:06:32.039" style="s2">someone better and so there is this</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.229" end="01:06:33.930" style="s2">arbitrary nature of the the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.039" end="01:06:36.390" style="s2">that you&#39;re attempting to deal with it</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.930" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">rewards and doesn&#39;t reward more or less</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.390" end="01:06:40.829" style="s2">of its own accord or there&#39;s an element</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:42.789" style="s2">of that and so it&#39;s ambiguous in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.829" end="01:06:44.289" style="s2">text even though there&#39;s a hint that</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.789" end="01:06:46.809" style="s2">you know perhaps Abel is doing a better</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.289" end="01:06:50.259" style="s2">job than Cain so I like that I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.809" end="01:06:52.900" style="s2">it&#39;s very sophisticated so what happens</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.259" end="01:06:54.699" style="s2">well Cain makes his offerings and God</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.900" end="01:06:56.979" style="s2">isn&#39;t happy with them now we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.699" end="01:06:59.049" style="s2">how Cain figures out that God isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.979" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">happy with his offerings we get some</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.049" end="01:07:03.249" style="s2">hints of that too but the story does</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.880" end="01:07:05.650" style="s2">tell us that&#39;s what happens and so then</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.249" end="01:07:07.739" style="s2">we get the psychological response on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.650" end="01:07:10.029" style="s2">part of pain now one response could be</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.739" end="01:07:12.249" style="s2">Jesus I must be doing something wrong I</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.029" end="01:07:13.959" style="s2">better straighten myself out you know I</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.249" end="01:07:15.400" style="s2">better come up with a better quality</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.959" end="01:07:17.589" style="s2">offering and try that again</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.400" end="01:07:20.289" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what happens what happens</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.589" end="01:07:22.569" style="s2">instead is that Cain becomes angry Roth</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.289" end="01:07:25.029" style="s2">and his countenance falls and so what</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.569" end="01:07:28.449" style="s2">does that mean it means this right it</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.029" end="01:07:31.689" style="s2">means he is not happy he&#39;s angry and out</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.449" end="01:07:33.459" style="s2">for revenge and so one of the I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.689" end="01:07:35.829" style="s2">thinking about this a lot lately with</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.459" end="01:07:37.660" style="s2">regards to the literature on inequality</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.829" end="01:07:39.729" style="s2">because there&#39;s a very good literature</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.660" end="01:07:41.410" style="s2">that shows for example that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.729" end="01:07:43.779" style="s2">there&#39;s a as a measure called the Gini</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.410" end="01:07:45.789" style="s2">coefficient and the Gini coefficient is</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.779" end="01:07:48.549" style="s2">a numerical index of the relative</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.789" end="01:07:50.049" style="s2">inequality of a geographical locale so</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.549" end="01:07:52.390" style="s2">for example if you went to Newfoundland</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.049" end="01:07:55.029" style="s2">where everyone is roughly not very rich</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.390" end="01:07:56.979" style="s2">or North Dakota say almost everyone</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.029" end="01:07:58.599" style="s2">there is say lower middle class</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.979" end="01:08:00.489" style="s2">something like that or upper working</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.599" end="01:08:03.909" style="s2">class something like that very little</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.489" end="01:08:05.650" style="s2">variability low Gini coefficient okay if</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.909" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">you go to Miami Beach say where</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.650" end="01:08:10.719" style="s2">everyone&#39;s rich low Gini coefficient</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:12.609" style="s2">because it isn&#39;t an index of absolute</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.719" end="01:08:15.339" style="s2">wealth or absolute poverty it&#39;s an index</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.609" end="01:08:17.230" style="s2">of relative poverty and so if everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.339" end="01:08:19.179" style="s2">rich the relative poverty is low and if</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.230" end="01:08:22.929" style="s2">everyone&#39;s poor the relative poverty is</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.179" end="01:08:24.940" style="s2">low now one question is where is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.929" end="01:08:28.029" style="s2">crime and you might think while the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.940" end="01:08:29.859" style="s2">crime is where the absolute poverty is</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.029" end="01:08:32.460" style="s2">high right or the absolute wealth is low</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.859" end="01:08:35.859" style="s2">that&#39;s where the crime is that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.460" end="01:08:38.949" style="s2">if it&#39;s if things are relatively</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.859" end="01:08:41.290" style="s2">distributed in an egalitarian manner the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.949" end="01:08:43.630" style="s2">male-on-male crime especially homicide</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.290" end="01:08:45.400" style="s2">is low and it&#39;s also the case where</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.630" end="01:08:47.529" style="s2">everyone is rich but if you go into</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.400" end="01:08:49.690" style="s2">places where there&#39;s some rich people</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.529" end="01:08:51.699" style="s2">but not very many and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.690" end="01:08:53.500" style="s2">people who are comparatively poor than</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.699" end="01:08:54.920" style="s2">the male homicide rapes rates and</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.500" end="01:08:57.380" style="s2">violent crime rate</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.920" end="01:08:59.750" style="s2">up substantially it&#39;s a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.380" end="01:09:02.449" style="s2">male-on-male competition and so what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.750" end="01:09:03.980" style="s2">could derive from that and maybe even</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.449" end="01:09:05.480" style="s2">reasonably is that you should flatten</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.980" end="01:09:06.890" style="s2">out today I&#39;m income into its</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.480" end="01:09:08.600" style="s2">distribution because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.890" end="01:09:10.699" style="s2">destabilizing the society by</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.600" end="01:09:12.710" style="s2">facilitating male criminal aggression</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.699" end="01:09:14.900" style="s2">you can make a good case for that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.710" end="01:09:16.819" style="s2">know in places like Colombia where the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.900" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">Gini coefficient got unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.819" end="01:09:21.770" style="s2">extreme society got so violent that it</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:24.830" style="s2">could barely hold itself together so so</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.770" end="01:09:26.989" style="s2">you can make a conservative argument for</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.830" end="01:09:28.279" style="s2">redistribution of income using the</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.989" end="01:09:29.929" style="s2">observation that if the income</p>

<p begin="01:09:29.929" end="01:09:34.520" style="s2">bloody thing starts to destabilize it</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.609" end="01:09:35.859" style="s2">might fall but but then you also might</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.520" end="01:09:38.569" style="s2">say wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.859" end="01:09:41.540" style="s2">is it inequality that&#39;s driving the</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.569" end="01:09:43.330" style="s2">violence or is it resentment of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.540" end="01:09:46.190" style="s2">inequality that&#39;s driving the violence</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.330" end="01:09:47.420" style="s2">now that&#39;s a tough question because you</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.190" end="01:09:48.890" style="s2">might say well what if the game is</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.420" end="01:09:49.880" style="s2">rigged and there&#39;s no way of moving up</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.890" end="01:09:52.250" style="s2">the power hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.880" end="01:09:53.989" style="s2">well then maybe anger and the desire for</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.250" end="01:09:56.449" style="s2">revolution is the appropriate response</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.989" end="01:09:58.940" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t really mean to me that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.449" end="01:10:00.770" style="s2">the response should be the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.940" end="01:10:03.429" style="s2">that you see in high Gini coefficient</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.770" end="01:10:07.699" style="s2">neighborhoods which is interracial</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.429" end="01:10:09.410" style="s2">intra-racial violence between men so for</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.699" end="01:10:11.780" style="s2">example in neighborhoods where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.410" end="01:10:13.850" style="s2">high murder rates the the murders are</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.780" end="01:10:16.429" style="s2">always between young men and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.850" end="01:10:18.110" style="s2">always within race and so that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.429" end="01:10:20.300" style="s2">seem to me to be exactly a politically</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.110" end="01:10:23.480" style="s2">revolutionary move right it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.300" end="01:10:26.330" style="s2">it&#39;s more like violent competition for</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.480" end="01:10:27.800" style="s2">the sake of attaining status and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.330" end="01:10:30.140" style="s2">might say well that&#39;s reasonable but</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.800" end="01:10:32.300" style="s2">because the inequality is there and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.140" end="01:10:33.530" style="s2">need to find status because it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.300" end="01:10:35.090" style="s2">what drives them forward it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.530" end="01:10:36.020" style="s2">what makes them attractive to women it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.090" end="01:10:38.060" style="s2">a necessity</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.020" end="01:10:40.040" style="s2">well the question is do you attain</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.060" end="01:10:42.080" style="s2">status through destruction or do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.040" end="01:10:43.820" style="s2">start making your offerings put in your</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.080" end="01:10:45.260" style="s2">offerings in order and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.820" end="01:10:47.060" style="s2">we really need to figure out because</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.260" end="01:10:48.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a fundamental political question</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.060" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamental political question</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.710" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">anyways what happens in this story is</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:56.120" style="s2">that khane decides that the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:58.310" style="s2">god isn&#39;t accepting his offerings means</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.120" end="01:11:02.750" style="s2">that he&#39;s entitled to become angry and</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.310" end="01:11:04.219" style="s2">and and negative it&#39;s good those two</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.750" end="01:11:06.440" style="s2">things are both put together right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.219" end="01:11:08.750" style="s2">Roth he&#39;s angry and he&#39;s also depressed</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.440" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">and so he&#39;s in a state of mind that well</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.750" end="01:11:12.680" style="s2">I think the best characterization for</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.400" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">that is hostile resentment because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.680" end="01:11:16.820" style="s2">unfair it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s unfair so</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.920" end="01:11:19.610" style="s2">what are going to do about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.820" end="01:11:21.410" style="s2">can you get destructive about it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.610" end="01:11:23.030" style="s2">going to change your approach well Cain</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.410" end="01:11:25.430" style="s2">he does the ultimate thing and this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.030" end="01:11:27.590" style="s2">what people do when they do the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.430" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">thing because that kind of hostile</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.590" end="01:11:32.210" style="s2">resentment has an archetypal endpoint</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:34.010" style="s2">and the archetypal end point is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.210" end="01:11:35.450" style="s2">point that you get when you&#39;re hostile</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.010" end="01:11:37.490" style="s2">and resentful because you haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.450" end="01:11:39.260" style="s2">successful and then you go sit in your</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.490" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">mother&#39;s basement for about 10 years and</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.260" end="01:11:42.650" style="s2">then you start imagining just how nice</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.090" style="s2">it would be if you shot up the local</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.650" end="01:11:46.850" style="s2">high school so that everybody knew your</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.090" end="01:11:48.500" style="s2">name and what happens is you go from I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.850" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">irritated because things aren&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.500" end="01:11:52.850" style="s2">out for me very well - I&#39;m irritated I</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:55.940" style="s2">and I hate those people for whom things</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.850" end="01:11:57.890" style="s2">are working out well - I&#39;m irritated and</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.940" end="01:11:59.780" style="s2">I hate the fact that the world is set up</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.890" end="01:12:01.940" style="s2">so that this has happened to me and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.780" end="01:12:03.170" style="s2">you go - well because I&#39;m irritated and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.940" end="01:12:05.270" style="s2">hate the world I&#39;m going to do whatever</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.170" end="01:12:07.430" style="s2">I can that will destroy it most rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.270" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">and with the with the highest possible</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.430" end="01:12:12.740" style="s2">amount of pain and suffering conceivable</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:14.180" style="s2">and at that point then you don&#39;t just go</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.740" end="01:12:16.430" style="s2">shoot up the high school you go up and</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.180" end="01:12:17.660" style="s2">shoot up the elementary school and so if</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.430" end="01:12:20.030" style="s2">you&#39;re wondering what kind of pathway</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.660" end="01:12:22.760" style="s2">people walk down to get to that point</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.030" end="01:12:25.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the pathway and the ultimate cap</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.760" end="01:12:27.620" style="s2">of that is well I&#39;ll kill the kids</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.550" end="01:12:28.820" style="s2">because well we already know that</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.620" end="01:12:30.200" style="s2">killing the innocent is a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.820" end="01:12:31.790" style="s2">effective than killing the guilty and</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.200" end="01:12:33.020" style="s2">then just to cap it off I&#39;ll blow my</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.790" end="01:12:35.750" style="s2">head off at the end just to show you</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.020" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">just how goddamn pointless it all is and</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.750" end="01:12:40.130" style="s2">so that&#39;s the logical extension of</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:41.660" style="s2">Kane&#39;s attitude and you might think well</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.130" end="01:12:42.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of an over-reading and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.660" end="01:12:44.090" style="s2">would say it&#39;s not an over-reading at</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.920" end="01:12:47.270" style="s2">all it&#39;s exactly what happens in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.090" end="01:12:50.150" style="s2">text so it&#39;s exactly what follows it so</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.270" end="01:12:54.110" style="s2">fine so Cain is not happy and so who is</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.150" end="01:12:56.540" style="s2">he not happy with well he&#39;s not happy</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.110" end="01:12:58.850" style="s2">with God so what does that mean well</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.540" end="01:13:00.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve already unpacked this he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.850" end="01:13:02.330" style="s2">happy with the social contract because</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.920" end="01:13:04.460" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the spirit the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.330" end="01:13:05.540" style="s2">patriarchal spirit let&#39;s say man there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.460" end="01:13:07.580" style="s2">more to it than that</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.540" end="01:13:09.980" style="s2">because we already we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.580" end="01:13:11.330" style="s2">analyzed what God the idea of God might</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.980" end="01:13:12.710" style="s2">represent in the background of this</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.330" end="01:13:14.960" style="s2">story he&#39;s not happy with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.710" end="01:13:17.570" style="s2">transcendent he&#39;s not happy with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.960" end="01:13:21.050" style="s2">idea of the logos all of that no faith</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.570" end="01:13:22.210" style="s2">in the transcendent nothing but he does</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.050" end="01:13:24.280" style="s2">nothing but despise</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.210" end="01:13:26.650" style="s2">the social contract and he&#39;s got no</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.280" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">faith whatsoever in the the logos let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.650" end="01:13:30.370" style="s2">say the word that brings chaos are the</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:33.219" style="s2">border he&#39;s all got nothing but contempt</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.370" end="01:13:34.989" style="s2">for all of that and you know certainly</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.219" end="01:13:36.340" style="s2">you know people like that and if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.989" end="01:13:37.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know them you just go on YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.340" end="01:13:42.400" style="s2">and read the comments and you&#39;ll see all</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.690" end="01:13:44.200" style="s2">sorts of people like that so so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.400" end="01:13:46.570" style="s2">so God has a little child with him and</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.200" end="01:13:51.010" style="s2">he says well what why are you angry and</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.570" end="01:13:54.130" style="s2">and why why are you upset and Cain says</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.010" end="01:13:56.710" style="s2">then God says if you do well won&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.130" end="01:13:58.750" style="s2">be accepted and if you don&#39;t do well sin</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.710" end="01:14:01.000" style="s2">lies at your door and unto thee shall be</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.750" end="01:14:01.660" style="s2">his desire and thou shalt rule over him</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.000" end="01:14:04.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.660" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a very mangled translation I</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.480" end="01:14:09.040" style="s2">would say so I&#39;m going to take it apart</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:11.110" style="s2">so what God says is while you&#39;re angry</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.040" end="01:14:11.650" style="s2">and you&#39;re upset it&#39;s like well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.110" end="01:14:15.190" style="s2">your problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.650" end="01:14:17.050" style="s2">and then God tells Cain if you did</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.190" end="01:14:18.940" style="s2">things properly they would work out for</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.050" end="01:14:20.739" style="s2">you was the last thing he wants to hear</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.940" end="01:14:22.000" style="s2">because what Cain wants to believe is</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.739" end="01:14:24.340" style="s2">that the reason he&#39;s not doing very well</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.000" end="01:14:26.560" style="s2">is because there&#39;s no sense having any</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.340" end="01:14:29.320" style="s2">faith in the logos the transcendent is</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.560" end="01:14:31.390" style="s2">is evil and aimed exactly against him</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.320" end="01:14:33.460" style="s2">and the entire social contract is faulty</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.390" end="01:14:36.270" style="s2">that&#39;s what he wants to hear but that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.460" end="01:14:40.560" style="s2">what God says God says wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.270" end="01:14:42.910" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re doing something wrong well</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.560" end="01:14:44.320" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe a worse message then</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.910" end="01:14:45.610" style="s2">everything else is corrupt it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.320" end="01:14:47.710" style="s2">you&#39;re having a problem because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.610" end="01:14:49.300" style="s2">just not everything you could be well</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.710" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">and then God says something really nasty</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.300" end="01:14:53.739" style="s2">and you can&#39;t help from this lines I</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:55.270" style="s2">read a bunch of translations to try to</p>

<p begin="01:14:55.270" end="01:15:01.000" style="s2">is what God tells Caden</p>

<p begin="01:15:44.860" end="01:15:51.070" style="s2">tells Cain it&#39;s like look it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.539" end="01:15:52.300" style="s2">enough that God says you know you should</p>

<p begin="01:15:52.300" end="01:15:54.159" style="s2">that&#39;s why things aren&#39;t going so well</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:15:56.199" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.159" end="01:15:58.480" style="s2">before you criticize the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.199" end="01:16:00.699" style="s2">and the world and the structure of being</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.480" end="01:16:02.199" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re doing something wrong but</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.699" end="01:16:03.940" style="s2">it&#39;s worse than that he says not only</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.199" end="01:16:05.289" style="s2">are you doing something wrong you bloody</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.940" end="01:16:07.480" style="s2">well know you&#39;re doing something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.289" end="01:16:08.829" style="s2">and you and you&#39;re doing it creatively</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.480" end="01:16:10.389" style="s2">and with intent</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.829" end="01:16:14.079" style="s2">so not only are things not going well</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.389" end="01:16:16.780" style="s2">for you but you&#39;ve played a creative</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.079" end="01:16:18.909" style="s2">role in producing that situation and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.780" end="01:16:20.530" style="s2">God basically says I am taking zero</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.909" end="01:16:23.769" style="s2">responsibility for rejecting your</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.530" end="01:16:27.489" style="s2">sacrifice it&#39;s all on you and so Cain</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.769" end="01:16:28.420" style="s2">leaves and he&#39;s like seriously not happy</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.489" end="01:16:31.900" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.420" end="01:16:33.820" style="s2">response because he wanted to hear pat</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.900" end="01:16:35.499" style="s2">pat you&#39;re a victim of circumstance and</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.820" end="01:16:37.780" style="s2">everything is conspiring against you and</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.499" end="01:16:39.190" style="s2">really being god I should get my act</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.780" end="01:16:41.440" style="s2">together and just give you what you want</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.190" end="01:16:44.499" style="s2">because obviously being God I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.440" end="01:16:45.999" style="s2">and you&#39;re right well that is what</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.499" end="01:16:48.280" style="s2">happens it&#39;s exactly the opposite that</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.999" end="01:16:50.139" style="s2">it&#39;s completely on you that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.280" end="01:16:52.599" style="s2">the judgment and so Cain leaves and</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.139" end="01:16:54.579" style="s2">believe me he&#39;s he was Roth before his</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.599" end="01:16:57.579" style="s2">countenance had fallen before but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.579" end="01:17:00.940" style="s2">nothing like it is now and so he hits</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.579" end="01:17:02.769" style="s2">the next stage and he thinks okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.940" end="01:17:04.179" style="s2">going to take my revenge what am I going</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.769" end="01:17:06.159" style="s2">to do I&#39;m going to find the most</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.179" end="01:17:08.409" style="s2">innocent and worthwhile thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.159" end="01:17:10.690" style="s2">favorite of God and I&#39;m going to kill it</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.409" end="01:17:12.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s what he does so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.690" end="01:17:14.739" style="s2">matter that his brother and Abel you</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.760" end="01:17:16.360" style="s2">know we&#39;re drawing the inference Abel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.739" end="01:17:19.030" style="s2">done the right things everyone likes him</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.360" end="01:17:20.530" style="s2">everything&#39;s flourishing for Abel he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.030" end="01:17:22.150" style="s2">good guys one of those people that you</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.530" end="01:17:23.380" style="s2">meet that has everything and then you</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.150" end="01:17:24.579" style="s2">meet them and you wish you could hate</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.380" end="01:17:26.170" style="s2">them but you can&#39;t because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.579" end="01:17:28.179" style="s2">really good people and then you really</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.170" end="01:17:29.739" style="s2">hate them because not only do they have</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.179" end="01:17:31.539" style="s2">everything but it appears that they</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.739" end="01:17:33.639" style="s2">deserve it and there&#39;s nothing that sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.539" end="01:17:35.739" style="s2">of sits in your soul and rots it more</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.639" end="01:17:38.170" style="s2">than that realization and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.739" end="01:17:40.570" style="s2">situation with Cain and so Cain thinks</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.170" end="01:17:42.369" style="s2">Cain talked with Abel his brother and it</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.570" end="01:17:44.590" style="s2">came to pass when they were in the field</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.369" end="01:17:47.380" style="s2">but Cain rose up against Abel his</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.590" end="01:17:48.699" style="s2">brother and slew him so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.380" end="01:17:49.360" style="s2">interesting because look look what</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.699" end="01:17:52.600" style="s2">happens to</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.360" end="01:17:54.610" style="s2">here so he&#39;s not doing well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.600" end="01:17:55.240" style="s2">separated from the transcendent and from</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.610" end="01:17:57.670" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.240" end="01:18:00.250" style="s2">he&#39;s bitterly resentful and now he goes</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.670" end="01:18:03.040" style="s2">out and kills the very thing that he</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.250" end="01:18:05.950" style="s2">most wants to be so he destroys his own</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:08.290" style="s2">ideal right he demolishes his own ideal</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.950" end="01:18:11.410" style="s2">that&#39;s how far his resentment has pushed</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.290" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">him and so he&#39;s he&#39;s done right but he</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.410" end="01:18:15.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because it enables him to</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:17.140" style="s2">take revenge so he doesn&#39;t care it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.220" end="01:18:18.670" style="s2">like it&#39;s like the the suicidal school</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.140" end="01:18:20.530" style="s2">shooter that blows off his head at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.670" end="01:18:22.210" style="s2">end of his mayhem it&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.530" end="01:18:25.780" style="s2">matter to him it&#39;s part of the same art</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.210" end="01:18:28.600" style="s2">form and the Lord says unto Cain where</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.780" end="01:18:30.030" style="s2">is Abel thy brother and Cain said I know</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.600" end="01:18:32.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t know am I my brother&#39;s keeper</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.030" end="01:18:33.580" style="s2">well that&#39;s a good question that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.320" end="01:18:35.280" style="s2">it&#39;s posed in the story because the</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.580" end="01:18:37.900" style="s2">answer that it&#39;s supposed to be yes and</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.280" end="01:18:40.090" style="s2">God says what have you done the voice of</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.900" end="01:18:42.970" style="s2">your brother&#39;s blood cries unto me from</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.090" end="01:18:47.200" style="s2">the ground that&#39;s actually the motif</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.970" end="01:18:49.090" style="s2">that Dostoyevsky explores I would say in</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.200" end="01:18:51.130" style="s2">crime and punishment because what</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.090" end="01:18:53.440" style="s2">happens is that the Skolnick Cobb is</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.130" end="01:18:55.150" style="s2">Cain for all intents and purposes and he</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.440" end="01:18:59.950" style="s2">commits a murder but he gets away with</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.150" end="01:19:01.930" style="s2">it well so he thinks so he thinks no one</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.950" end="01:19:04.090" style="s2">suspects him he buries the money he</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.930" end="01:19:06.670" style="s2">can&#39;t stand to touch the body he buries</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.090" end="01:19:08.440" style="s2">it in a in a abandoned lot and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.670" end="01:19:09.700" style="s2">drawn there now and then to look at</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.440" end="01:19:12.760" style="s2">where it is but he can&#39;t touch it</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.700" end="01:19:15.370" style="s2">because the money it&#39;s so funny because</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.760" end="01:19:17.830" style="s2">the money before he kills the pawnbroker</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.370" end="01:19:20.710" style="s2">is not the same as the money after he</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.830" end="01:19:22.630" style="s2">kills the pawnbroker and the Restonic</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.710" end="01:19:24.310" style="s2">off before he kills the pawnbroker is</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.630" end="01:19:26.170" style="s2">not the same as the risk Olenick off</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.310" end="01:19:29.950" style="s2">after he kills the Paulding broker in</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.170" end="01:19:32.650" style="s2">fact they&#39;re not the same at all and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.950" end="01:19:34.720" style="s2">the Skolnick have is tormented by God</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.650" end="01:19:35.050" style="s2">you could say but not from the external</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.720" end="01:19:37.120" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.050" end="01:19:39.910" style="s2">he sets the crime up quite nicely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.120" end="01:19:42.250" style="s2">that this the spirit against which he</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.910" end="01:19:45.130" style="s2">transgressed tortures him from within</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.250" end="01:19:46.510" style="s2">and there&#39;s no escape from and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.130" end="01:19:49.150" style="s2">eventually what happens in crime and</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.510" end="01:19:51.550" style="s2">punishment is the Skolnick ov continues</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.150" end="01:19:53.890" style="s2">to manifest himself as guilty in every</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.550" end="01:19:55.960" style="s2">possible way until he receives the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.890" end="01:19:57.280" style="s2">punishment that he desires because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.960" end="01:20:00.190" style="s2">the only way that he can set things</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.280" end="01:20:02.639" style="s2">right he actually he actually he</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.190" end="01:20:03.929" style="s2">essentially turns himself in</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.639" end="01:20:06.959" style="s2">eventually because he can&#39;t tolerate</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.929" end="01:20:10.169" style="s2">what he&#39;s done so well so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.959" end="01:20:15.619" style="s2">idea the voice of thy brother&#39;s blood</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.169" end="01:20:18.179" style="s2">cries unto me from the ground it&#39;s guilt</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.619" end="01:20:19.769" style="s2">and now you&#39;re cursed from the earth</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.179" end="01:20:23.340" style="s2">which has opened her mouth to receive</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.769" end="01:20:24.630" style="s2">thy brother&#39;s blood from thy hand when</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.340" end="01:20:27.239" style="s2">you till the ground it will not</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.630" end="01:20:29.880" style="s2">henceforth yield unto you it strength a</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.239" end="01:20:32.280" style="s2">fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.880" end="01:20:35.849" style="s2">the earth you know and you might say</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.280" end="01:20:40.610" style="s2">well why does God not just strike Kain</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.849" end="01:20:40.610" style="s2">dead and the answer to that perhaps is</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.840" end="01:20:47.459" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t be sufficient punishment</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.019" end="01:20:50.219" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.459" end="01:20:53.309" style="s2">like what&#39;s the punishment you live with</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.219" end="01:20:55.739" style="s2">what you did right and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.309" end="01:20:56.989" style="s2">anybody taking out either because then</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.739" end="01:21:00.139" style="s2">you won&#39;t have to live with what you did</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.989" end="01:21:02.189" style="s2">so that&#39;s the punishment and Cain says</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.139" end="01:21:03.149" style="s2">unto the Lord my punishment is greater</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.189" end="01:21:05.789" style="s2">than I can bear</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.149" end="01:21:07.320" style="s2">like yea behold you have driven me out</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.789" end="01:21:09.630" style="s2">this day from the face of the earth and</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.320" end="01:21:10.889" style="s2">from thy face shall I be hid that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.630" end="01:21:13.349" style="s2">same as what happens to Adam in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.889" end="01:21:15.059" style="s2">Garden of Eden remember Adam hides from</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.349" end="01:21:17.880" style="s2">God and he has his reasons</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.059" end="01:21:20.209" style="s2">and now Cain is alienated from God</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.880" end="01:21:22.590" style="s2">there&#39;s no Reid there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.209" end="01:21:25.679" style="s2">reconstructing that relationship he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.590" end="01:21:27.689" style="s2">put himself by violating his contract</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.679" end="01:21:29.369" style="s2">let&#39;s say with the transcendent and also</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.689" end="01:21:31.679" style="s2">with society and also with his own</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.369" end="01:21:33.630" style="s2">spirit he&#39;s put himself outside the</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.679" end="01:21:35.849" style="s2">possibility of redemption and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.630" end="01:21:38.699" style="s2">he says the punishment is greater than I</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.849" end="01:21:40.139" style="s2">could bear there&#39;s no hope left right so</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.699" end="01:21:45.269" style="s2">he&#39;s in hell for all intents and</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.139" end="01:21:46.800" style="s2">purposes behold thou hast driven me out</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.269" end="01:21:48.329" style="s2">this day from the face of the earth and</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.800" end="01:21:50.280" style="s2">from thy face shall I be hid and I shall</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.329" end="01:21:51.719" style="s2">be a fugitive and a vagabond in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.280" end="01:21:54.090" style="s2">earth and it shall come to pass that</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.719" end="01:21:57.389" style="s2">everyone who finds me will will kill me</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.090" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">and God says therefore whoever slayeth</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.389" end="01:22:02.249" style="s2">Cain vengeance shall be taken on him</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:04.469" style="s2">Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark onto</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.249" end="01:22:06.360" style="s2">Cain lest any finding him should kill</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.469" end="01:22:08.579" style="s2">him now that&#39;s interesting you think why</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.360" end="01:22:09.929" style="s2">in the world would God protect Cain well</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.579" end="01:22:12.599" style="s2">the next part of the story actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.929" end="01:22:13.199" style="s2">tells you that you have a family I have</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.599" end="01:22:16.139" style="s2">a family</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.199" end="01:22:19.560" style="s2">your brother kills my son so what</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.139" end="01:22:22.469" style="s2">you I come and I kill your father and</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.560" end="01:22:24.630" style="s2">your cousin and then you think well I</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.469" end="01:22:25.920" style="s2">killed your father and your cousin I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.630" end="01:22:28.500" style="s2">going to come back and I&#39;m going to kill</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.920" end="01:22:31.530" style="s2">four of your people and then I come back</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.500" end="01:22:33.810" style="s2">and say yeah no problem it&#39;s sixteen to</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.530" end="01:22:35.790" style="s2">you this time and then you come back and</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.810" end="01:22:38.070" style="s2">you say sixteen a let&#39;s try for</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.790" end="01:22:39.750" style="s2">thirty-two and so this is what happens</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.070" end="01:22:41.820" style="s2">this is actually why justice systems are</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.750" end="01:22:43.440" style="s2">set up by the way you go there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.820" end="01:22:46.320" style="s2">of reasons justice systems are set up</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.440" end="01:22:48.449" style="s2">and one is to punish the guilty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.320" end="01:22:51.540" style="s2">one the other is to have the guilty</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.449" end="01:22:52.050" style="s2">repent that&#39;s two to maintain social</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.540" end="01:22:54.060" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.050" end="01:22:57.449" style="s2">that&#39;s three here&#39;s another one that no</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.060" end="01:23:01.080" style="s2">one ever thinks about back thirty years</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.449" end="01:23:03.210" style="s2">ago the governor of Massachusetts whose</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.080" end="01:23:05.100" style="s2">name I forget was running for president</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.210" end="01:23:06.900" style="s2">and while he was governor of</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.100" end="01:23:08.670" style="s2">Massachusetts he had released a number</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.900" end="01:23:09.989" style="s2">of prisoners one of whom his name was I</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.670" end="01:23:12.540" style="s2">think Willie</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.989" end="01:23:15.270" style="s2">maybe Hortense doesn&#39;t really matter and</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.540" end="01:23:17.670" style="s2">when Willie was released on this program</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.270" end="01:23:19.650" style="s2">he went out and raped someone and</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.670" end="01:23:21.360" style="s2">perhaps killed them I can&#39;t remember but</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.650" end="01:23:25.230" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter that the rape is good</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.360" end="01:23:29.489" style="s2">enough and the governor was asked during</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.230" end="01:23:31.650" style="s2">a debate what he would do if a relief</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.489" end="01:23:35.130" style="s2">prisoner had raped his daughter or his</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.650" end="01:23:37.170" style="s2">wife and he gave a very weak answer what</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.130" end="01:23:39.210" style="s2">was his name he did a very weak answer</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.170" end="01:23:41.280" style="s2">of something about you know letting the</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.210" end="01:23:43.170" style="s2">law take its due course and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.280" end="01:23:47.190" style="s2">wrong answer right the right answer is I</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.170" end="01:23:49.110" style="s2">would be compelled with every fiber of</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.190" end="01:23:52.489" style="s2">my being to hunt that person down and to</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.110" end="01:23:54.750" style="s2">tear them into bits but I won&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.489" end="01:23:57.330" style="s2">now what so what&#39;s the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.750" end="01:23:59.840" style="s2">justice system it&#39;s to alleviate you</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.330" end="01:24:01.530" style="s2">from the responsibility of revenge</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.840" end="01:24:05.219" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.530" end="01:24:07.469" style="s2">because otherwise what happens you kill</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.219" end="01:24:09.800" style="s2">one I kill two you kill four I kill</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.469" end="01:24:13.380" style="s2">eight you kill sixteen and soon</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.800" end="01:24:15.449" style="s2">everyone&#39;s at war and so God protects</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.380" end="01:24:17.820" style="s2">Cain to stop that from happening to stop</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.449" end="01:24:19.739" style="s2">the feud from emerging because those</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.820" end="01:24:21.570" style="s2">things can go forever and then from</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.739" end="01:24:23.969" style="s2">transforming the entire society into a</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.570" end="01:24:28.380" style="s2">state of war and so what&#39;s also so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.969" end="01:24:29.730" style="s2">tell you the rest of the story and Cain</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.380" end="01:24:29.910" style="s2">went out from the presence of the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.730" end="01:24:31.830" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.910" end="01:24:33.570" style="s2">well in the Land of Nod on the East of</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.830" end="01:24:36.210" style="s2">Eden and Cain knew his wife and she</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.570" end="01:24:38.670" style="s2">conceived and bare Enoch etc so now you</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.210" end="01:24:40.260" style="s2">have a genealogy right so Cain starts to</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.670" end="01:24:42.990" style="s2">have a family you have a genealogy and</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.260" end="01:24:45.240" style="s2">so a number of people are named in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.990" end="01:24:47.490" style="s2">lineage and so and it tells you what</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.240" end="01:24:49.860" style="s2">this is sort of an attempt to describe</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.490" end="01:24:51.960" style="s2">how things came about so this is like</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.860" end="01:24:55.800" style="s2">the naming of the heroes of old and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.960" end="01:24:59.310" style="s2">you have Enoch who builds the city you</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.800" end="01:25:01.290" style="s2">have jebel who is the father of those</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.310" end="01:25:04.230" style="s2">who dwell in tents and of those who have</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.290" end="01:25:06.780" style="s2">cattle you have Jubal who is the father</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.230" end="01:25:09.480" style="s2">of musicians and Zillah</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.780" end="01:25:11.430" style="s2">who bore tubal Cain now tubal Cain is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.480" end="01:25:14.850" style="s2">very interesting person</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.430" end="01:25:18.420" style="s2">by tradition tubal Cain is the first</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.850" end="01:25:21.990" style="s2">artificer of weapons of war so Cain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.420" end="01:25:24.320" style="s2">descendent after multiple generations is</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.990" end="01:25:27.540" style="s2">the person who produces weapons of war</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:29.550" style="s2">alright and so so there&#39;s another bit of</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.540" end="01:25:35.610" style="s2">the story within which that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.550" end="01:25:41.670" style="s2">placed in context and Lamech who&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.610" end="01:25:44.520" style="s2">of the grandchildren of Cain says unto</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.670" end="01:25:46.770" style="s2">his wife that wives Adah and Zillah hear</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.520" end="01:25:49.530" style="s2">my voice ye wives of Lamech hearken unto</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.770" end="01:25:52.290" style="s2">my speech for I have slain a man to my</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.530" end="01:25:55.800" style="s2">wounding and a young man to my hurt okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.290" end="01:25:56.850" style="s2">so what he&#39;s saying is he he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.800" end="01:26:00.390" style="s2">involved in a murder</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.850" end="01:26:04.140" style="s2">if can be a vote Avenged Sevenfold truly</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.390" end="01:26:08.100" style="s2">Lamech seventy and Sevenfold and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.140" end="01:26:12.060" style="s2">there&#39;s the implication there that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.100" end="01:26:15.090" style="s2">tit for tat process has begun Cain kills</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.060" end="01:26:18.000" style="s2">Abel Abel Cain&#39;s children kill seven</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.090" end="01:26:20.430" style="s2">Cain&#39;s grandchildren kill seventy fold</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.000" end="01:26:22.970" style="s2">and then tubal Cain pops up on the</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.430" end="01:26:26.760" style="s2">horizon and he&#39;s the person who makes</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.970" end="01:26:30.000" style="s2">artifices of war and so the story in its</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.760" end="01:26:32.280" style="s2">fragmentary manner ties the individual</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.000" end="01:26:35.400" style="s2">psychopathology that&#39;s resentful and</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.280" end="01:26:37.830" style="s2">revenge seeking to the proclivity for</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.400" end="01:26:39.810" style="s2">broad scale warfare and this really hit</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.830" end="01:26:41.820" style="s2">me because I was interested particularly</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.810" end="01:26:43.300" style="s2">in what was happening in the Nazi camps</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.820" end="01:26:45.970" style="s2">with the guards</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.300" end="01:26:48.760" style="s2">because the guards were gratuitously</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.970" end="01:26:50.740" style="s2">cruel and I was very curious about that</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.760" end="01:26:53.380" style="s2">and so here&#39;s an interesting story this</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.740" end="01:26:55.990" style="s2">was in a book called ordinary Germans</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.380" end="01:26:57.670" style="s2">Hitler&#39;s willing executioner&#39;s and it</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.990" end="01:26:59.380" style="s2">was a book that was written about 30</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.670" end="01:27:01.750" style="s2">years ago that challenged the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.380" end="01:27:03.790" style="s2">the Nazi phenomena was top-down order</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.750" end="01:27:06.850" style="s2">following which I don&#39;t believe by the</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.790" end="01:27:09.820" style="s2">way I think that&#39;s a very weak weak</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.850" end="01:27:11.380" style="s2">hypothesis fascistic societies are</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.820" end="01:27:13.840" style="s2">fascistic at every single level of</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.380" end="01:27:15.820" style="s2">organization spiritually within the</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.840" end="01:27:17.350" style="s2">family within the local community it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.820" end="01:27:19.420" style="s2">like a holograph it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.350" end="01:27:21.160" style="s2">absolutely everywhere it&#39;s not top-down</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.420" end="01:27:22.810" style="s2">I mean there are leaders who get</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.160" end="01:27:25.270" style="s2">produced and maybe they catalyze it but</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.810" end="01:27:27.070" style="s2">to blame it on the leaders is to forget</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.270" end="01:27:29.800" style="s2">about the process by which the leaders</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.070" end="01:27:31.840" style="s2">come to be so no you don&#39;t get a past</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.800" end="01:27:36.490" style="s2">that way so here&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.840" end="01:27:38.650" style="s2">that happened as the Nazis started to</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.490" end="01:27:39.850" style="s2">lose the war so here&#39;s what you should</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.650" end="01:27:41.470" style="s2">have done if you were a Nazi and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.850" end="01:27:42.790" style="s2">wanted to win the war you should have</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.470" end="01:27:45.310" style="s2">enslaved the Jews and the gypsies and</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.790" end="01:27:46.960" style="s2">had them work right you have the head</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.310" end="01:27:49.810" style="s2">should have had them work for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.960" end="01:27:51.250" style="s2">benefit of the victory and then if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.810" end="01:27:53.110" style="s2">wanted to liquidate them afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.250" end="01:27:55.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the logical thing to do if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.110" end="01:27:57.340" style="s2">want to win and we assume that Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.510" end="01:27:59.110" style="s2">wanted to win but that&#39;s not a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.340" end="01:28:01.480" style="s2">intelligent assumption why would you</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.110" end="01:28:03.190" style="s2">assume that he wasn&#39;t exactly a good guy</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.480" end="01:28:05.710" style="s2">so why should we assume that he was</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.190" end="01:28:07.930" style="s2">aiming at the good that he was promoting</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.710" end="01:28:10.660" style="s2">even in his own terms right</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.930" end="01:28:12.670" style="s2">the glorious everlasting fourth Third</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.660" end="01:28:14.890" style="s2">Reich right let a rule for a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.670" end="01:28:16.210" style="s2">years and be a bastion of civilization</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.890" end="01:28:17.770" style="s2">in music because that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.210" end="01:28:20.320" style="s2">thing he purported to be interested in</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.770" end="01:28:23.170" style="s2">well so what do you do with the Jews and</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.320" end="01:28:25.420" style="s2">the gypsies well round them up fine it</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.170" end="01:28:27.430" style="s2">slave them fine you don&#39;t kill them you</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.420" end="01:28:30.250" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t devote a substantial</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.430" end="01:28:33.160" style="s2">proportion of your war resources while</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.250" end="01:28:34.960" style="s2">you&#39;re losing to accelerate the rate at</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.160" end="01:28:36.400" style="s2">which the extermination is taking place</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.960" end="01:28:38.380" style="s2">because that&#39;s a bit counterproductive</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.400" end="01:28:40.510" style="s2">unless what you&#39;re aiming at is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.380" end="01:28:42.940" style="s2">maximum possible mayhem in the shortest</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.510" end="01:28:44.830" style="s2">period of time well so what happened as</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.940" end="01:28:47.620" style="s2">the Germans started to lose the war did</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.830" end="01:28:48.910" style="s2">Hitler lose faith in his own ability no</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.620" end="01:28:50.710" style="s2">he believed that the Germans had</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.910" end="01:28:53.020" style="s2">betrayed him with weakness and so he was</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.710" end="01:28:54.880" style="s2">perfectly willing to accelerate the rate</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.020" end="01:28:55.600" style="s2">at which Germany was losing the war and</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.880" end="01:28:57.550" style="s2">so when</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.600" end="01:29:00.340" style="s2">Hitler and his minions have the choice</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.550" end="01:29:03.430" style="s2">here&#39;s the choice you can suspend your</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.340" end="01:29:05.740" style="s2">unnecessary demolition of people win the</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.430" end="01:29:07.750" style="s2">damn war and then pick it up afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.740" end="01:29:09.610" style="s2">or while you&#39;re losing you can just</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.750" end="01:29:11.290" style="s2">accelerate the mayhem even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.610" end="01:29:14.140" style="s2">counterproductive it&#39;s like what they</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.290" end="01:29:15.760" style="s2">pick well they pick to accelerate demand</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.140" end="01:29:17.860" style="s2">and so to me there&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.760" end="01:29:21.370" style="s2">psychoanalytic idea I think this was</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.860" end="01:29:23.830" style="s2">derived by you you can&#39;t figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.370" end="01:29:28.270" style="s2">someone is doing or why look at the</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.830" end="01:29:32.470" style="s2">outcome and infer the motivation if it</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.270" end="01:29:34.990" style="s2">produces mayhem perhaps it was aiming at</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.470" end="01:29:37.420" style="s2">mayhem now you know you have to use that</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.990" end="01:29:39.040" style="s2">dictum carefully if someone&#39;s irritating</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.420" end="01:29:40.420" style="s2">you you know maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.040" end="01:29:42.130" style="s2">irritable that you should sort yourself</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.420" end="01:29:43.870" style="s2">out but maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.130" end="01:29:46.780" style="s2">actually aiming at irritating you and</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.870" end="01:29:48.670" style="s2">that&#39;s the actual motivation so perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.780" end="01:29:53.320" style="s2">not but it&#39;s another tool in your</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.670" end="01:29:54.910" style="s2">analytical armament so and so you see</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.320" end="01:29:56.770" style="s2">well this is the thing about warfare</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.910" end="01:29:59.140" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting about about</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.770" end="01:30:02.080" style="s2">because you can you can attribute it to</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.140" end="01:30:04.090" style="s2">territoriality you can attribute it to a</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.080" end="01:30:10.860" style="s2">war for resources that&#39;s what the I</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.090" end="01:30:13.900" style="s2">would say wretchedly simple-minded</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.860" end="01:30:16.870" style="s2">economists presume people fight over</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.900" end="01:30:18.880" style="s2">scarce resources it&#39;s like hey we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.870" end="01:30:20.860" style="s2">little bit more sophisticated than that</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.880" end="01:30:22.720" style="s2">and first of all what resources are you</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.860" end="01:30:24.580" style="s2">talking about the bloody idiot had</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.720" end="01:30:26.950" style="s2">nothing they live perfectly well what</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.580" end="01:30:28.570" style="s2">did they have snow and seal blubber</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.950" end="01:30:31.450" style="s2">you know people can live and</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.570" end="01:30:33.100" style="s2">unbelievably deprived conditions and so</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.450" end="01:30:35.290" style="s2">the idea that there are natural</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.100" end="01:30:36.730" style="s2">resources that we fight over because</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.290" end="01:30:38.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a shortage of them is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.730" end="01:30:40.720" style="s2">oversimplified view of human beings it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.800" end="01:30:42.310" style="s2">like well why do people fight well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.720" end="01:30:44.290" style="s2">they fight sometimes for good reasons</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.310" end="01:30:46.720" style="s2">but very very frequently they fight for</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.290" end="01:30:49.810" style="s2">bad reasons and those bad reasons are</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.720" end="01:30:51.820" style="s2">our personal as well as socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.810" end="01:30:53.610" style="s2">and economic you know if you are a Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.820" end="01:30:55.690" style="s2">prison guard for example whatever</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.610" end="01:30:57.190" style="s2">pathologies you were carrying around in</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.690" end="01:30:59.320" style="s2">your destructive little soul whatever</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.190" end="01:31:01.360" style="s2">element of Kane was deeply embedded in</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.320" end="01:31:02.950" style="s2">you had the opportunity to be manifest</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.360" end="01:31:04.630" style="s2">fully at every moment of your waking</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.950" end="01:31:07.570" style="s2">existence right you have these people</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.630" end="01:31:09.419" style="s2">who are completely beholden to you with</p>

<p begin="01:31:13.889" end="01:31:17.010" style="s2">was a motivation for putting them there</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.179" end="01:31:18.719" style="s2">to begin with and all the cover story</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.010" end="01:31:19.889" style="s2">about well we&#39;re trying to build the</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.719" end="01:31:21.449" style="s2">Third Reich and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.889" end="01:31:23.010" style="s2">stabilize the state and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.449" end="01:31:24.360" style="s2">do all these good things maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.010" end="01:31:27.239" style="s2">just a cover story for the real</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.360" end="01:31:29.189" style="s2">motivation which is nothing but but what</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.239" end="01:31:30.989" style="s2">the construction of death camps that</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.189" end="01:31:32.999" style="s2">killed 6 million people how about that</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.989" end="01:31:35.489" style="s2">and the obliteration of 120 million</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.999" end="01:31:37.849" style="s2">people on the planet and the end oh and</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.489" end="01:31:41.039" style="s2">the and the leaving of European runes</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.849" end="01:31:42.539" style="s2">maybe that was the motivation or are we</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.039" end="01:31:44.610" style="s2">going to attribute to Hitler the highest</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.539" end="01:31:47.309" style="s2">possible motives say no it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.610" end="01:31:49.559" style="s2">archetypal manifestation of Cain now</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.309" end="01:31:51.840" style="s2">he&#39;s going to put up a front it says I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.559" end="01:31:55.369" style="s2">your savior it&#39;s like well destructive</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.840" end="01:31:55.369" style="s2">people think that Cain is their Savior</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.059" end="01:32:05.510" style="s2">let&#39;s take a break for 15 minutes so ok</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.449" end="01:32:05.510" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.579" end="01:32:14.669" style="s2">the next thing that happens these</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.599" end="01:32:17.519" style="s2">stories were sewed together right to</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.669" end="01:32:21.019" style="s2">make something that resembles a coherent</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.519" end="01:32:23.459" style="s2">text and there&#39;s this literary athletic</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.019" end="01:32:26.249" style="s2">no there&#39;s a literary technique known as</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.459" end="01:32:28.769" style="s2">metonymy and metonymy is the</p>

<p begin="01:32:35.399" end="01:32:43.049" style="s2">the stories are sequenced and the</p>

<p begin="01:32:43.049" end="01:32:48.659" style="s2">sequenced in a particular manner and you</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.499" end="01:32:51.629" style="s2">might operate under the assumption that</p>

<p begin="01:33:02.429" end="01:33:05.569" style="s2">the stories evolved somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.569" end="01:33:08.369" style="s2">independently and then they were</p>

<p begin="01:33:10.260" end="01:33:15.479" style="s2">not entirely coherent because there are</p>

<p begin="01:33:15.479" end="01:33:19.949" style="s2">the sentence so for example the creation</p>

<p begin="01:33:25.829" end="01:33:30.149" style="s2">of the Bible whatever that means</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.419" end="01:33:31.889" style="s2">is are bothered by those contradictions</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.149" end="01:33:33.239" style="s2">and turn themselves into knots trying to</p>

<p begin="01:33:33.239" end="01:33:40.069" style="s2">because you want the story to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.639" end="01:33:40.069" style="s2">coherent but you know that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.089" end="01:33:44.129" style="s2">it&#39;s important but it&#39;s also beside the</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.769" end="01:33:45.510" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.129" end="01:33:46.979" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to focus on one level of</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.510" end="01:33:48.599" style="s2">analysis at the exclusion of all the</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.979" end="01:33:51.599" style="s2">other levels of analysis that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.599" end="01:33:53.159" style="s2">the right way to think about it now the</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.599" end="01:33:54.839" style="s2">fact that these stories are sequence in</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.159" end="01:33:56.459" style="s2">a particular manner and that that kind</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.839" end="01:33:58.619" style="s2">of makes sense implies that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.459" end="01:34:02.099" style="s2">sort of narrative coherence underneath</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.619" end="01:34:03.629" style="s2">driving forward otherwise they would be</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.099" end="01:34:05.459" style="s2">nothing but a random assemblage of</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.629" end="01:34:07.139" style="s2">stories and they&#39;re by no means random</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.459" end="01:34:08.669" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure they&#39;re selected and</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.139" end="01:34:11.129" style="s2">edited and put together in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.669" end="01:34:12.689" style="s2">manner by and then stored that way and</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.129" end="01:34:14.899" style="s2">dealt with in a particular manner by</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.689" end="01:34:17.249" style="s2">thousands of people over many many years</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.899" end="01:34:19.340" style="s2">what happens after Cain and Abel is</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.249" end="01:34:22.849" style="s2">while there&#39;s an interlude which is</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.340" end="01:34:25.550" style="s2">this interlude and it&#39;s kind of a bridge</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.849" end="01:34:27.349" style="s2">and and there&#39;s a lot packed into it too</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.550" end="01:34:29.960" style="s2">although I&#39;m not going to take it apart</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.349" end="01:34:31.610" style="s2">very much says so this is after after</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.960" end="01:34:33.530" style="s2">the Cain and Abel story and it came to</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.610" end="01:34:35.119" style="s2">pass when men began to multiply on the</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.530" end="01:34:37.159" style="s2">face of the earth and daughters were</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.119" end="01:34:39.020" style="s2">born unto them but the sons of God saw</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.159" end="01:34:41.060" style="s2">the daughters of men that they were fair</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.020" end="01:34:44.090" style="s2">and then took them wives of all which</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.060" end="01:34:45.710" style="s2">they chose and there were giants in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.090" end="01:34:47.360" style="s2">earth in those days and also after that</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.710" end="01:34:48.590" style="s2">when the sons of God came into the</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.360" end="01:34:50.840" style="s2">daughters of men and they bare children</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.590" end="01:34:53.810" style="s2">to them the same became mighty men which</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.840" end="01:34:55.429" style="s2">are of old men of renown okay so I</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.810" end="01:34:59.380" style="s2">already pointed out that if you go back</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.429" end="01:35:03.489" style="s2">just a little bit you see that the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.380" end="01:35:10.719" style="s2">descendants of Cain are represented as</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.489" end="01:35:10.719" style="s2">founders of institutions right there are</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.980" end="01:35:18.860" style="s2">Enoch who builds the city and an adder</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.400" end="01:35:20.360" style="s2">or jabal who is the father of those who</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.860" end="01:35:22.429" style="s2">dwell in tents and of those who own</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.360" end="01:35:24.170" style="s2">cattle and then there&#39;s Jubal who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.429" end="01:35:26.000" style="s2">father of all that are musicians and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.170" end="01:35:29.179" style="s2">on so one of the things that you see in</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.000" end="01:35:31.369" style="s2">in myths very frequently is that if</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.179" end="01:35:33.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a pattern of behavior that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.369" end="01:35:35.659" style="s2">characteristic of the culture that</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.290" end="01:35:37.880" style="s2">pattern of behavior is attributed to a</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.659" end="01:35:40.310" style="s2">hero who was in the past who was the</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.880" end="01:35:42.710" style="s2">first person who did that and so you</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.310" end="01:35:44.690" style="s2">might say well what does that mean well</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.710" end="01:35:46.969" style="s2">it means in Parkton there was the first</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.690" end="01:35:49.610" style="s2">person who did that although more likely</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.969" end="01:35:51.710" style="s2">there was an assemblage of people who</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.610" end="01:35:53.630" style="s2">aggregated that particular ability say</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.710" end="01:35:56.420" style="s2">the ability to play music across a very</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.630" end="01:35:57.889" style="s2">large amount of time but these are pre</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.420" end="01:36:00.230" style="s2">literate people right and they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.889" end="01:36:02.150" style="s2">to remember the past and so what happens</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.230" end="01:36:04.790" style="s2">Mircea Eliade documented this quite well</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.150" end="01:36:07.639" style="s2">is that that aggregation of people gets</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.790" end="01:36:10.820" style="s2">collapsed into a single meta person and</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.639" end="01:36:12.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the hero of old and so and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.820" end="01:36:14.389" style="s2">already talked about how this works is</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.560" end="01:36:15.830" style="s2">that you know there are admirable people</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.389" end="01:36:17.270" style="s2">and then you can tell a story about an</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.830" end="01:36:19.369" style="s2">admirable person and then you can</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.270" end="01:36:21.440" style="s2">extract a story out of the set of</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.369" end="01:36:24.230" style="s2">admirable people and you keep building</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.440" end="01:36:26.389" style="s2">higher and higher order admirable people</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.230" end="01:36:28.369" style="s2">until you extract out at the top what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.389" end="01:36:30.110" style="s2">ultimately admirable and this is</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.369" end="01:36:32.100" style="s2">actually an indication of that process</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.110" end="01:36:33.660" style="s2">occurring the Giants that are</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.100" end="01:36:36.120" style="s2">referred to in this particular phrase</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.660" end="01:36:38.630" style="s2">are the heroes of the past who</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.120" end="01:36:41.220" style="s2">established the traditions on which the</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.630" end="01:36:44.480" style="s2">society exists and so that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.220" end="01:36:47.190" style="s2">compacted into this little paragraph so</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.480" end="01:36:48.570" style="s2">this little paragraph here there were</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.190" end="01:36:50.160" style="s2">giants in the earth in those days and</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.570" end="01:36:51.780" style="s2">after that when the sons of God came</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.160" end="01:36:53.430" style="s2">into the daughters of men and they bare</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.780" end="01:36:56.280" style="s2">children to them the same became mighty</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.430" end="01:36:59.310" style="s2">men which were of old men of renown well</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.280" end="01:37:00.840" style="s2">you could hardly say I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.310" end="01:37:03.900" style="s2">very little difference between what I</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.840" end="01:37:06.300" style="s2">just told you and what this story says I</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.900" end="01:37:10.140" style="s2">mean it says it as if it was something</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.300" end="01:37:12.300" style="s2">that literally occurred but in some</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.140" end="01:37:14.220" style="s2">sense it doesn&#39;t exactly say that it</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.300" end="01:37:16.740" style="s2">says well the ancient landscape was a</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.220" end="01:37:18.330" style="s2">landscape of heroic adventurers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.740" end="01:37:20.610" style="s2">like well we do that to our own history</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.330" end="01:37:24.480" style="s2">right I mean even when we consider it</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.610" end="01:37:27.150" style="s2">literal history we don&#39;t pick people at</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.480" end="01:37:30.930" style="s2">random to historic I sweep ick people</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.150" end="01:37:33.150" style="s2">who had some substantive impact and tell</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.930" end="01:37:35.280" style="s2">stories about them and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.150" end="01:37:37.440" style="s2">emblematic in some sense of the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.280" end="01:37:40.410" style="s2">of striving that characterizes humanity</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.440" end="01:37:42.300" style="s2">and and so you can&#39;t have history</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.410" end="01:37:44.760" style="s2">without some mythologies ation because</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.300" end="01:37:47.190" style="s2">the mythologies ation occurs at the</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.760" end="01:37:48.630" style="s2">level of the selection of the entities</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.190" end="01:37:52.020" style="s2">about which you&#39;re going to weave the</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.630" end="01:37:53.850" style="s2">historical tale so okay so anyway so</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.020" end="01:37:56.730" style="s2">there&#39;s little there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.850" end="01:37:58.590" style="s2">interlude there that it talks about the</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.730" end="01:38:00.330" style="s2">appearance of heroes in the past but</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.590" end="01:38:04.860" style="s2">then it&#39;s just that&#39;s just done with</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.330" end="01:38:07.650" style="s2">very very rapidly and then we move into</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.860" end="01:38:13.200" style="s2">another story this is the story of Noah</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.650" end="01:38:15.750" style="s2">so the way it looks to me is that the</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.200" end="01:38:17.460" style="s2">the part of Genesis that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.750" end="01:38:19.080" style="s2">talk to you about ends with the flood</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.460" end="01:38:21.690" style="s2">myth and also with the Tower of Babel</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.080" end="01:38:24.060" style="s2">and so the flood myth is the demolition</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.690" end="01:38:25.740" style="s2">of everything that came before and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.060" end="01:38:28.980" style="s2">Tower of Babel in some sense is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.740" end="01:38:31.860" style="s2">the same thing so there&#39;s two chaotic I</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.980" end="01:38:33.630" style="s2">mean it&#39;s like the fall occurs in stages</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.860" end="01:38:36.180" style="s2">there&#39;s paradise and then Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.630" end="01:38:39.240" style="s2">fall into culture and then Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.180" end="01:38:42.090" style="s2">Cain falls into chaos and then the</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.240" end="01:38:43.920" style="s2">entire society falls into chaos and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.090" end="01:38:44.540" style="s2">flood comes and the Tower of Babel is</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.920" end="01:38:47.600" style="s2">produced</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.540" end="01:38:50.570" style="s2">and then that&#39;s the end of the truly</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.600" end="01:38:52.940" style="s2">archaic parts of the Bible and so what</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.570" end="01:38:55.430" style="s2">that seems to me what&#39;s happening it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.940" end="01:38:57.830" style="s2">very sophisticated is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.430" end="01:39:00.320" style="s2">implicit causal narrative being warrant</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.830" end="01:39:03.560" style="s2">woven about the manner in which Cain</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.320" end="01:39:05.060" style="s2">responds and the probability that human</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.560" end="01:39:07.820" style="s2">beings are going to deteriorate and the</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.060" end="01:39:09.470" style="s2">flood is going to come so and God saw</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.820" end="01:39:12.140" style="s2">that the wickedness of man was great in</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.470" end="01:39:13.840" style="s2">the earth and that every imagination of</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.140" end="01:39:17.390" style="s2">the thoughts of his heart was only evil</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.840" end="01:39:19.040" style="s2">continually and it repented the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.390" end="01:39:20.150" style="s2">that he had made man on earth and it</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.040" end="01:39:21.830" style="s2">grieved him at his heart</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.150" end="01:39:23.660" style="s2">well we already encountered a story like</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.830" end="01:39:26.750" style="s2">that once already right that happened in</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.660" end="01:39:29.540" style="s2">the martyr story where time out and</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.750" end="01:39:31.970" style="s2">absolute give rise to the elder gods and</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.540" end="01:39:34.760" style="s2">they kill absolute which was not very</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.970" end="01:39:38.030" style="s2">smart idea right they demolish the sub</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.760" end="01:39:40.390" style="s2">structure of their stable society and of</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.030" end="01:39:44.510" style="s2">course chaos comes flooding back well</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.390" end="01:39:50.060" style="s2">what does it mean to say that human</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.510" end="01:39:51.500" style="s2">beings let&#39;s see to say that the</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.060" end="01:39:53.510" style="s2">wickedness of man was great in the earth</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.500" end="01:39:54.950" style="s2">and that every imagination of the hearts</p>

<p begin="01:39:54.950" end="01:39:58.760" style="s2">only evil continually is not much</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.900" end="01:40:01.610" style="s2">different than to say that people are</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.760" end="01:40:03.200" style="s2">acting in a manner that demolishes the</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.610" end="01:40:05.540" style="s2">cultural structure now we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.200" end="01:40:07.970" style="s2">even pointed out that the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.540" end="01:40:10.160" style="s2">structure that happens in this story was</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.970" end="01:40:13.190" style="s2">produced by the heroic Giants of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.160" end="01:40:15.530" style="s2">past right and we&#39;ve also noted that</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.190" end="01:40:17.270" style="s2">what Kane is objecting to in his Kane</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.530" end="01:40:18.920" style="s2">like manner is the social structure</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.270" end="01:40:21.380" style="s2">which isn&#39;t rewarding properly and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.920" end="01:40:23.870" style="s2">transcendence that&#39;s above that and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.380" end="01:40:26.210" style="s2">spirit of logos itself he&#39;s rejecting</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.870" end="01:40:29.410" style="s2">all that okay so the issue here is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.210" end="01:40:33.740" style="s2">when that sort of evil is produced</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.410" end="01:40:35.720" style="s2">exactly as when AB sue is Slade Slade I</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.740" end="01:40:37.760" style="s2">guess that&#39;s right by the by the Elder</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.720" end="01:40:39.890" style="s2">Gods then all hell breaks loose all</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.760" end="01:40:41.450" style="s2">chaos comes back now time at if you</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.890" end="01:40:43.580" style="s2">remember correctly is the god of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.450" end="01:40:45.950" style="s2">salt water goddess of the salt water and</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.580" end="01:40:49.310" style="s2">so the return of time at and the flood</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.950" end="01:40:51.890" style="s2">are mythologically similar ideas now</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.310" end="01:40:53.630" style="s2">Elia has taken apart flood myths from</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.890" end="01:40:56.060" style="s2">all over the world and he made two</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.630" end="01:40:57.770" style="s2">brilliant comments about them and there</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.060" end="01:40:58.280" style="s2">are also akin to some degree to what you</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.770" end="01:41:00.260" style="s2">can see</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.280" end="01:41:02.660" style="s2">the Egyptian story about Seth and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.260" end="01:41:03.770" style="s2">corruption of the state so because the</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.660" end="01:41:06.230" style="s2">Egyptians figured out that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.770" end="01:41:08.570" style="s2">always a power working within the state</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.230" end="01:41:09.950" style="s2">let&#39;s say that corrupted it now that was</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.570" end="01:41:11.870" style="s2">set and that was always working for its</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.950" end="01:41:14.180" style="s2">overthrow it&#39;s an idea like Satan and I</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.870" end="01:41:15.950" style="s2">said that the the word Seth becomes the</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.180" end="01:41:21.080" style="s2">word Satan through Coptic Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.950" end="01:41:23.180" style="s2">so so the le adds I deal with this that</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.080" end="01:41:25.310" style="s2">things fall apart of their own accord</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.180" end="01:41:27.110" style="s2">merely because they aged that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.310" end="01:41:28.670" style="s2">first motif in the flood story and</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.110" end="01:41:30.710" style="s2">that&#39;s only to say that if you build</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.670" end="01:41:32.030" style="s2">something it decays if you build</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.710" end="01:41:32.540" style="s2">something and you just leave it the hell</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.030" end="01:41:35.120" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.540" end="01:41:37.550" style="s2">it will soon not work right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.120" end="01:41:39.890" style="s2">entropy so one of the reasons that the</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.550" end="01:41:42.770" style="s2">flood always threatens is merely because</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.890" end="01:41:44.330" style="s2">of entropy and you see that reflected in</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.770" end="01:41:48.290" style="s2">the Egyptian story because one of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.330" end="01:41:51.290" style="s2">reasons that Osiris falls prey to Seth</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.290" end="01:41:53.600" style="s2">is because he&#39;s old you know he was a</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.290" end="01:41:55.100" style="s2">great hero when he was young and created</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.600" end="01:41:57.710" style="s2">the Egyptian state like the men of</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.100" end="01:41:59.660" style="s2">renown but now he&#39;s old and it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.710" end="01:42:01.700" style="s2">he&#39;s be willfully blind but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.660" end="01:42:04.220" style="s2">next thing but the fact that he&#39;s all is</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.700" end="01:42:04.910" style="s2">just to start things fall apart of their</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.220" end="01:42:06.470" style="s2">own accord</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.910" end="01:42:09.800" style="s2">so once something is given to you you</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.470" end="01:42:11.780" style="s2">have to maintain it just to ensure its</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.800" end="01:42:14.150" style="s2">continued existence and so you actually</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.780" end="01:42:15.620" style="s2">you actually have a contract with most</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.150" end="01:42:18.440" style="s2">of the things that you own it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.620" end="01:42:20.420" style="s2">like a it&#39;s like a moral contract let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.440" end="01:42:22.610" style="s2">say you have a car well you&#39;ve decided</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.420" end="01:42:25.430" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to sacrifice to have</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.610" end="01:42:28.490" style="s2">the car and so you you performed an</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.430" end="01:42:30.500" style="s2">ethical calculation but the car was only</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.490" end="01:42:32.630" style="s2">worth the sacrifice as long as it</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.500" end="01:42:34.850" style="s2">functions as a car and so what that</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.630" end="01:42:36.890" style="s2">means is that to justify the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.850" end="01:42:38.660" style="s2">you&#39;ve made to have the car you have to</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.890" end="01:42:40.880" style="s2">maintain the car because otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.660" end="01:42:42.800" style="s2">you&#39;re acting out the proposition that</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.880" end="01:42:44.360" style="s2">the thing you sacrificed for actually</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.800" end="01:42:46.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any value and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.360" end="01:42:48.710" style="s2">obliterating that as a useful contract</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.220" end="01:42:50.720" style="s2">and you run into the situation where the</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.710" end="01:42:52.970" style="s2">car will just deteriorate of its own</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.720" end="01:42:55.790" style="s2">accord and then you won&#39;t have a car at</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.970" end="01:42:57.640" style="s2">all well so let&#39;s say how do you speed</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.790" end="01:43:00.860" style="s2">the process by which your car</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.640" end="01:43:02.480" style="s2">deteriorates well that&#39;s easy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.860" end="01:43:04.310" style="s2">driving it along the road and it starts</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.480" end="01:43:06.020" style="s2">to make a ticking noise tick tick tick</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.310" end="01:43:07.640" style="s2">tick and you think I should go have that</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.020" end="01:43:09.830" style="s2">ticking noise checked because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.640" end="01:43:12.050" style="s2">heard it and then you think nah it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.830" end="01:43:13.940" style="s2">matter it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.050" end="01:43:16.340" style="s2">probably it&#39;ll matter and what does</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.940" end="01:43:18.980" style="s2">matter mean well matter is mother that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.340" end="01:43:21.469" style="s2">chaos to you no matter but what it means</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.980" end="01:43:23.659" style="s2">is that that little ticking noise is the</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.469" end="01:43:25.099" style="s2">birthplace of time at in your car that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.659" end="01:43:27.409" style="s2">a good way of thinking about it is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.099" end="01:43:29.090" style="s2">it&#39;s your first indication that the</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.409" end="01:43:31.400" style="s2">dragon of chaos is going to manifest</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.090" end="01:43:34.179" style="s2">itself in your car that happens when you</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.400" end="01:43:36.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a funny story about that so I</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.179" end="01:43:38.989" style="s2">had a friend in in in graduate school</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.980" end="01:43:41.179" style="s2">someone I really liked but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.989" end="01:43:43.400" style="s2">call her mikela mechanically inclined</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.179" end="01:43:45.499" style="s2">let&#39;s put it that way and she had an old</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.400" end="01:43:47.329" style="s2">Honda and those things were notorious</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.499" end="01:43:48.829" style="s2">for rusting out this is thirty years ago</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.329" end="01:43:50.630" style="s2">when they were first produced they</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.829" end="01:43:52.969" style="s2">weren&#39;t adapted well to Canadian winters</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.630" end="01:43:54.679" style="s2">and we used to go in her car in her</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.969" end="01:43:56.539" style="s2">Honda and it got a little on the scary</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.679" end="01:43:58.880" style="s2">side because it was so rusty underneath</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.539" end="01:44:00.499" style="s2">that you can actually see through the</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.880" end="01:44:02.420" style="s2">floorboards and that actually made me</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.499" end="01:44:04.880" style="s2">nervous because if you can see through</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.420" end="01:44:06.679" style="s2">the floorboards that means that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.880" end="01:44:10.940" style="s2">not really floorboards what they are is</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.679" end="01:44:12.260" style="s2">like rust and so I mentioned the fact</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.940" end="01:44:13.460" style="s2">that that might be a problem to her a</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.260" end="01:44:15.739" style="s2">couple of times but she was sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.460" end="01:44:17.420" style="s2">blithe about it and one day she was</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.739" end="01:44:18.679" style="s2">driving down st. Lawrence Street in</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.420" end="01:44:21.260" style="s2">Montreal which is the main street</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.679" end="01:44:23.230" style="s2">running roughly north and south and her</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.260" end="01:44:25.670" style="s2">hood popped up it bent and popped up</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.230" end="01:44:27.739" style="s2">spontaneously and so she was pretty</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.670" end="01:44:29.869" style="s2">curious about that and so she was with</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.739" end="01:44:31.760" style="s2">this friend of hers who was just as</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.869" end="01:44:34.039" style="s2">clueless mechanically as she was which</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.760" end="01:44:36.499" style="s2">is really quite remarkably clueless and</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.039" end="01:44:38.150" style="s2">so they pulled off into a service</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.499" end="01:44:40.519" style="s2">station and had the guy come out look at</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.150" end="01:44:42.079" style="s2">it and well he he opened the hood</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.519" end="01:44:45.889" style="s2">obviously and what had happened was the</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.079" end="01:44:47.869" style="s2">body had fallen off the frame so and</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.889" end="01:44:49.489" style="s2">what had happened was the shock which is</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.869" end="01:44:52.599" style="s2">like supposed to be attached to the car</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.489" end="01:44:57.019" style="s2">had pushed up through the through the</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.599" end="01:44:59.239" style="s2">hood so literally that car body had like</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.019" end="01:45:01.489" style="s2">fallen onto the ground and but she was</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.239" end="01:45:04.039" style="s2">she managed to drive the car okay so</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.489" end="01:45:06.650" style="s2">look that&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t exactly call that</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.039" end="01:45:08.150" style="s2">willful blindness because perhaps there</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.650" end="01:45:09.590" style="s2">was an element of willful blindness she</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.150" end="01:45:12.739" style="s2">didn&#39;t know anything about mechanics but</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.590" end="01:45:13.820" style="s2">you get the point right it&#39;s like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.739" end="01:45:15.800" style="s2">say she would have been in a fatal</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.820" end="01:45:17.659" style="s2">accident you might say well you can</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.800" end="01:45:19.460" style="s2">shake your fist at God for producing the</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.659" end="01:45:20.900" style="s2">circumstances but you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.460" end="01:45:23.389" style="s2">you could see through the floorboards</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.900" end="01:45:25.369" style="s2">that&#39;s probably something that you might</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.389" end="01:45:27.079" style="s2">have paid attention to and so</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.369" end="01:45:29.599" style="s2">always the question is if things fall</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.079" end="01:45:31.340" style="s2">apart around you to what degree is it</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.599" end="01:45:33.769" style="s2">the mere tendency of things to</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.340" end="01:45:36.260" style="s2">degenerate entropically because they do</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.769" end="01:45:39.169" style="s2">that of their own accord or have you</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.260" end="01:45:41.539" style="s2">sped the probability of decay by failing</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.169" end="01:45:43.429" style="s2">to pay attention when with our little</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.539" end="01:45:45.590" style="s2">snake manifests itself inside your</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.429" end="01:45:46.249" style="s2">paradise and it&#39;s always it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.590" end="01:45:49.399" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.249" end="01:45:51.050" style="s2">so when here&#39;s a here&#39;s an example an</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.399" end="01:45:53.659" style="s2">interesting example I think so</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.050" end="01:45:56.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought about the actual floods</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.659" end="01:45:59.209" style="s2">like the New Orleans flood</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.030" end="01:46:00.889" style="s2">okay so New Orleans is built where there</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.209" end="01:46:02.570" style="s2">are floods everyone knows that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.889" end="01:46:04.159" style="s2">a major port in the United States a huge</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.570" end="01:46:05.389" style="s2">part of American trade goes down the</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.159" end="01:46:06.919" style="s2">rivers to New Orleans</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.389" end="01:46:08.389" style="s2">so there was a reason it was built where</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.919" end="01:46:10.280" style="s2">it was even though it was a dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.389" end="01:46:11.599" style="s2">place to build it and in order to</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.280" end="01:46:13.280" style="s2">maintain New Orleans they had to build</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.599" end="01:46:16.929" style="s2">these levees that kept the water back</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.280" end="01:46:19.579" style="s2">now the American what is it American</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.929" end="01:46:21.110" style="s2">Army Corps of Engineers if I remember</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.579" end="01:46:23.179" style="s2">correctly was responsible for building</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.110" end="01:46:27.110" style="s2">and maintaining the levees and the dikes</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.179" end="01:46:29.239" style="s2">okay Holland is also built underwater as</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.110" end="01:46:31.789" style="s2">you may or may not know and they build</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.239" end="01:46:33.199" style="s2">huge dikes to keep the ocean back so</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.789" end="01:46:34.610" style="s2">they could reclaim the land and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.199" end="01:46:37.340" style="s2">basically Holland Holland is an</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.610" end="01:46:39.139" style="s2">unbelievably organized society and part</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.340" end="01:46:40.789" style="s2">of the reason is is it isn&#39;t land it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.139" end="01:46:42.889" style="s2">underwater and so if you&#39;re not bloody</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.789" end="01:46:45.320" style="s2">well awake in Holland then the ocean</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.889" end="01:46:46.999" style="s2">comes in and you all drown and so the</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.320" end="01:46:49.340" style="s2">Dutch are very very careful about such</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.999" end="01:46:51.590" style="s2">things and they build their dikes so</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.340" end="01:46:53.389" style="s2">that they calculate storm intensity and</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.590" end="01:46:56.300" style="s2">then they calculate the intensity of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.389" end="01:46:57.769" style="s2">worst storm in 10,000 years and then</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.300" end="01:47:00.050" style="s2">they build the dikes to withstand that</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.769" end="01:47:02.300" style="s2">storm the Army Corps of Engineers built</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.050" end="01:47:04.039" style="s2">the dikes in New Orleans to withstand</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.300" end="01:47:05.780" style="s2">the worst storm in a hundred years and</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.039" end="01:47:07.939" style="s2">they knew that was insufficient and New</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.780" end="01:47:10.039" style="s2">Orleans Louisiana is an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.939" end="01:47:11.119" style="s2">corrupt state and you can&#39;t dump money</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.039" end="01:47:13.459" style="s2">in there to fix things because people</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.119" end="01:47:15.079" style="s2">just steal all the money so and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.459" end="01:47:16.429" style="s2">nothing gets fixed and so then what</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.079" end="01:47:17.629" style="s2">happens there&#39;s a hurricane and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.429" end="01:47:19.789" style="s2">what happens there&#39;s a flood and</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.629" end="01:47:22.789" style="s2">everybody says why would God send the</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.789" end="01:47:24.439" style="s2">flood and answer that is well was there</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.789" end="01:47:26.570" style="s2">a flood or where the dikes not high</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.439" end="01:47:28.820" style="s2">enough and that&#39;s what&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.570" end="01:47:30.919" style="s2">is that it&#39;s always this is a great</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.820" end="01:47:35.449" style="s2">father versus great mother</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.919" end="01:47:38.749" style="s2">conundrum if a system failed is it</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.449" end="01:47:39.270" style="s2">because of the surround overwhelming the</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.749" end="01:47:40.890" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.270" end="01:47:44.250" style="s2">or is it because the system was</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.890" end="01:47:46.890" style="s2">insufficiently awake and doomed itself</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.250" end="01:47:49.020" style="s2">okay so Eliot its take on the flood myth</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.890" end="01:47:51.810" style="s2">is this God comes along and floods the</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.020" end="01:47:54.270" style="s2">world periodically why and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.810" end="01:47:56.460" style="s2">the catastrophic influx of chaos right</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.270" end="01:47:57.750" style="s2">so chaos will wipe you out from time to</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.460" end="01:48:00.120" style="s2">time why</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.750" end="01:48:02.310" style="s2">well entropy does in your conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.120" end="01:48:05.010" style="s2">schemes and your willful blindness</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.310" end="01:48:06.570" style="s2">speeds the process and remember that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.010" end="01:48:08.820" style="s2">what the Egyptians said about Osiris</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.570" end="01:48:11.370" style="s2">right they said he was old he was a</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.820" end="01:48:15.180" style="s2">great king a man of renown but he was</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.370" end="01:48:16.770" style="s2">old but he was also willfully blind and</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.180" end="01:48:18.600" style="s2">it was the combination of his age and</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.770" end="01:48:20.640" style="s2">his willful blindness that allowed Seth</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.600" end="01:48:22.770" style="s2">to chop them up into pieces and and</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.640" end="01:48:24.810" style="s2">depose them and so that would that</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.770" end="01:48:27.690" style="s2">ferret out it&#39;s brilliant right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.810" end="01:48:29.760" style="s2">like why the states fall apart because</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.690" end="01:48:31.350" style="s2">the structures get old and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.760" end="01:48:33.840" style="s2">taking care of them and people have</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.350" end="01:48:35.730" style="s2">their eyes closed and so it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.840" end="01:48:37.410" style="s2">situation it&#39;s the same situation in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.730" end="01:48:39.030" style="s2">flood myths it&#39;s like well yeah things</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.410" end="01:48:41.640" style="s2">fall apart they&#39;re going to flood but if</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.030" end="01:48:43.500" style="s2">you were awake enough and you were on</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.640" end="01:48:45.840" style="s2">top of it then you could continually</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.500" end="01:48:48.120" style="s2">stave that off and actually partly what</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.840" end="01:48:50.070" style="s2">you&#39;re doing because you&#39;re alive is</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.120" end="01:48:52.650" style="s2">staving off entropy like you&#39;re an anti</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.070" end="01:48:54.090" style="s2">em tropic process it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.650" end="01:48:56.130" style="s2">definition of life there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.090" end="01:48:57.660" style="s2">physicist named Erland Schrodinger who</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.130" end="01:48:59.100" style="s2">wrote a book called what is life and</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.660" end="01:49:00.900" style="s2">that&#39;s the fundamental thesis of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.100" end="01:49:03.000" style="s2">book you&#39;re always trying to stave off</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.900" end="01:49:04.800" style="s2">entropy what&#39;s the best way to stave off</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.000" end="01:49:07.950" style="s2">entropy decay chaos</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.800" end="01:49:09.630" style="s2">keep your eyes open that&#39;s the rule shut</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.950" end="01:49:11.400" style="s2">your eyes especially two things you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.630" end="01:49:13.440" style="s2">you should see the flood comes and</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.400" end="01:49:15.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the evil of man that&#39;s laid out</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.440" end="01:49:18.510" style="s2">in this story because that&#39;s the worst</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.570" end="01:49:20.730" style="s2">sort of perhaps it&#39;s not the worst it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.510" end="01:49:22.350" style="s2">one of the primary sins so to speak that</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.730" end="01:49:23.610" style="s2">will bring about the flood we already</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.350" end="01:49:28.280" style="s2">talked about the other things that</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.610" end="01:49:28.280" style="s2">characterized Cain&#39;s attitude so</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.150" end="01:49:37.520" style="s2">here we go so gods upset because he made</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.020" end="01:49:39.950" style="s2">man on earth and it grieved him at his</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.520" end="01:49:41.570" style="s2">heart and God says I will destroy man</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.950" end="01:49:43.520" style="s2">whom I have created from the face of the</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.570" end="01:49:44.900" style="s2">earth both man and beast and the</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.520" end="01:49:48.440" style="s2">creeping thing and the fowls of the air</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.900" end="01:49:50.330" style="s2">for I repent that I&#39;ve made them but</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.440" end="01:49:52.760" style="s2">Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.330" end="01:49:57.740" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s an interesting thing so</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.760" end="01:49:59.420" style="s2">here what we have is the question is the</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.740" end="01:50:01.550" style="s2">whole worlds in chaos at this point</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.420" end="01:50:04.040" style="s2">right in this point the story and the</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.550" end="01:50:06.110" style="s2">chaos is of multiple sorts it arose from</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.040" end="01:50:08.570" style="s2">the fall it rose from the emergence of</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.110" end="01:50:10.790" style="s2">self-consciousness it emerged safe arose</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.570" end="01:50:12.920" style="s2">from the sins of Cain like things are</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.790" end="01:50:14.780" style="s2">not going well it&#39;s multiple levels of</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.920" end="01:50:16.550" style="s2">collapse and it&#39;s got to the point where</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.780" end="01:50:18.290" style="s2">God saying this is a mess like it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.550" end="01:50:20.600" style="s2">a mess that the whole thing has to be</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.290" end="01:50:22.730" style="s2">washed away the first fall wasn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.600" end="01:50:24.350" style="s2">even Cain&#39;s collapse wasn&#39;t enough we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.730" end="01:50:27.230" style="s2">going to just scrub the whole bloody</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.350" end="01:50:30.260" style="s2">thing clean so it&#39;s it&#39;s the ultimate in</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.230" end="01:50:31.790" style="s2">traumatic collapses the question is well</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.260" end="01:50:35.420" style="s2">what do you do in the face of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.790" end="01:50:37.490" style="s2">ultimate in traumatic collapses and the</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.420" end="01:50:39.980" style="s2">answers in the story so know as someone</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.490" end="01:50:42.380" style="s2">who finds fate who finds favor in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.980" end="01:50:44.360" style="s2">eyes of God so he&#39;s like Abel there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.380" end="01:50:46.310" style="s2">something that Noah&#39;s doing right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.360" end="01:50:48.980" style="s2">going to enable him to ride out the</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.310" end="01:50:51.020" style="s2">storm and so the question hits the same</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.980" end="01:50:54.560" style="s2">question do you want to have a life</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.020" end="01:50:56.000" style="s2">where there&#39;s no storms or do you want</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.560" end="01:50:59.390" style="s2">to have a life where you can ride out</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.000" end="01:51:00.860" style="s2">the storms that&#39;s the issue right are</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.390" end="01:51:02.600" style="s2">you behind the dikes or do you build a</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.860" end="01:51:04.910" style="s2">boat do you tap them the boat that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.600" end="01:51:06.980" style="s2">same idea and so the idea here is that</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.910" end="01:51:08.780" style="s2">the thing that rides out the chaos is</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.980" end="01:51:10.940" style="s2">the thing that builds and captain&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.780" end="01:51:14.090" style="s2">boat it&#39;s another dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.940" end="01:51:15.500" style="s2">idea what should be at the top well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.090" end="01:51:17.180" style="s2">the top of something that doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.500" end="01:51:19.340" style="s2">flooded out as well what should be at</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.180" end="01:51:21.140" style="s2">the top well it&#39;s to be the boat builder</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.340" end="01:51:22.880" style="s2">and to be the captain of the boat it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.140" end="01:51:26.690" style="s2">not to be hidden from the flood</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.880" end="01:51:29.260" style="s2">precisely and so I mean here&#39;s a here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.690" end="01:51:31.850" style="s2">here&#39;s something to think about identity</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.260" end="01:51:35.060" style="s2">identity politics because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.850" end="01:51:38.750" style="s2">we&#39;re up to our neck it okay are you who</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.060" end="01:51:40.460" style="s2">you are can I box you in will you accept</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.750" end="01:51:42.230" style="s2">that as an identity so I could do that</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.460" end="01:51:43.380" style="s2">lots of ways you&#39;re male you&#39;re Asia</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.230" end="01:51:45.060" style="s2">you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.380" end="01:51:47.580" style="s2">right there&#39;s things about you that I</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.060" end="01:51:49.500" style="s2">can derive because of your putative</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.580" end="01:51:52.410" style="s2">membership in a set of different groups</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.500" end="01:51:54.390" style="s2">the problem with doing that is that the</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.410" end="01:51:57.840" style="s2">number of groups that I can assign you</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.390" end="01:51:59.910" style="s2">to is without end so I have to pick</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.840" end="01:52:01.590" style="s2">arbitrary groups to assign you to and</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.910" end="01:52:03.000" style="s2">you can accept that if you want but</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.590" end="01:52:04.980" style="s2">there&#39;s no evidence that those are the</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.000" end="01:52:06.600" style="s2">proper canonical groups but maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.980" end="01:52:08.550" style="s2">happy about that because now you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.600" end="01:52:10.650" style="s2">assigned membership in a group and</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.550" end="01:52:14.490" style="s2">that&#39;s your identity okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.650" end="01:52:18.360" style="s2">question is well fine what happens when</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.490" end="01:52:23.220" style="s2">that identity is flown into pieces then</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.360" end="01:52:25.440" style="s2">what well here&#39;s here&#39;s the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.220" end="01:52:29.120" style="s2">some degree and this is the answer</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.440" end="01:52:29.120" style="s2">that&#39;s embedded in the story of Noah</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.270" end="01:52:37.230" style="s2">if you want to withstand chaos do you</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.740" end="01:52:39.030" style="s2">want to be who you are or do you want to</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.230" end="01:52:41.700" style="s2">be the thing that changes who you are</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.030" end="01:52:43.140" style="s2">constantly that&#39;s the question and</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.700" end="01:52:44.340" style="s2">that&#39;s the difference that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.140" end="01:52:46.620" style="s2">difference there&#39;s a categorical</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.340" end="01:52:49.050" style="s2">difference in identity are you who you</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.620" end="01:52:51.000" style="s2">are or are you the thing that could</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.050" end="01:52:53.460" style="s2">continually be more than you are and</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.000" end="01:52:56.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that isn&#39;t the stable</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.460" end="01:52:58.980" style="s2">identity it&#39;s not the initial state it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.640" end="01:53:01.440" style="s2">also not the state of being in chaos</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.980" end="01:53:03.180" style="s2">that nihilistic state let&#39;s say and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.440" end="01:53:04.890" style="s2">not even the state of reformulations</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.180" end="01:53:06.960" style="s2">that occurs after you&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.890" end="01:53:08.940" style="s2">the process it&#39;s the state of</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.960" end="01:53:10.950" style="s2">continually going through the process so</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.940" end="01:53:13.740" style="s2">you can identify with the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.950" end="01:53:15.300" style="s2">trends you can identify identify with</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.740" end="01:53:17.460" style="s2">the thing that you are or you can</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.300" end="01:53:20.820" style="s2">identify with the thing that transforms</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.460" end="01:53:22.500" style="s2">who you are right and that&#39;s the same as</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.820" end="01:53:24.120" style="s2">the state subjugating itself to the</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.500" end="01:53:26.580" style="s2">individual because the individual is the</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.120" end="01:53:28.230" style="s2">thing that transforms the state and what</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.580" end="01:53:30.090" style="s2">the state should do the states necessary</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.230" end="01:53:32.370" style="s2">because obviously it organizes all of us</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.090" end="01:53:34.830" style="s2">into peaceful cooperation and</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.370" end="01:53:36.690" style="s2">competition the states necessary then</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.830" end="01:53:39.390" style="s2">the question is is the state the highest</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.690" end="01:53:41.670" style="s2">good an answer that is well it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.390" end="01:53:43.740" style="s2">because it&#39;s old and dead and blind and</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.670" end="01:53:46.110" style="s2">so if the state becomes the highest good</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.740" end="01:53:48.410" style="s2">then you&#39;re occupied by the spirit of</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.110" end="01:53:50.850" style="s2">something that&#39;s old and dead and blind</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.410" end="01:53:52.410" style="s2">well that&#39;s not only not good for you</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.850" end="01:53:54.390" style="s2">because then you&#39;re old and dead and</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.410" end="01:53:56.370" style="s2">blind but it&#39;s also bad for the state</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.390" end="01:53:58.860" style="s2">because as soon as the state gets old in</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.370" end="01:54:00.300" style="s2">dead and blind God gets unhappy with it</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.860" end="01:54:03.870" style="s2">and the chaos comes in and washes it</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.300" end="01:54:05.970" style="s2">away so it seems like a bad solution so</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.870" end="01:54:07.950" style="s2">what&#39;s the proper solution you</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.970" end="01:54:10.110" style="s2">subordinate your group identity to the</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.950" end="01:54:12.840" style="s2">identity that transforms your identity</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.110" end="01:54:15.840" style="s2">right and the state subordinates its</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.840" end="01:54:17.400" style="s2">power to the vision and articulation of</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.840" end="01:54:19.620" style="s2">the individual because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.400" end="01:54:21.630" style="s2">revives the state and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.620" end="01:54:25.110" style="s2">these stories are trying to stumble</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.630" end="01:54:27.540" style="s2">towards roughly speaking so Noah found</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.110" end="01:54:29.820" style="s2">grace in the eyes of the Lord why well</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.540" end="01:54:32.310" style="s2">Noah was a just man and perfect in his</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.820" end="01:54:37.290" style="s2">generations and Noah walked with God now</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.310" end="01:54:39.330" style="s2">remember in the Adam and Eve story Adam</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.290" end="01:54:41.190" style="s2">was walking with God to begin with but</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.330" end="01:54:43.530" style="s2">then he got all self-conscious and hid</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.190" end="01:54:46.110" style="s2">behind a bush and when God came to walk</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.530" end="01:54:48.150" style="s2">with him he blamed his wife for his</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.110" end="01:54:49.980" style="s2">insufficiencies which I still think</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.150" end="01:54:51.270" style="s2">that&#39;s such an unbelievably comic story</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.980" end="01:54:53.760" style="s2">I just can&#39;t believe it it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.270" end="01:54:55.710" style="s2">absolutely ridiculous but that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.760" end="01:54:58.170" style="s2">what happened while you have Noah here</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.710" end="01:55:00.540" style="s2">and Noah Noah&#39;s like a counter another</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.170" end="01:55:02.940" style="s2">counterpart to some degree to Cain no as</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.540" end="01:55:04.470" style="s2">a just man and he walks with God and so</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.940" end="01:55:06.150" style="s2">he&#39;s oriented properly and because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.470" end="01:55:09.150" style="s2">oriented properly when the flood comes</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.150" end="01:55:11.850" style="s2">not only does he manage to get through</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.150" end="01:55:14.070" style="s2">it as an individual he manages to get</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.850" end="01:55:16.380" style="s2">through it with his family and he saves</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.070" end="01:55:18.000" style="s2">and while he saves he roughly saves the</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.380" end="01:55:19.530" style="s2">world that&#39;s how the story puts it</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.000" end="01:55:21.450" style="s2">forward I mean it&#39;s an ark and it&#39;s full</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.530" end="01:55:24.150" style="s2">of animals you know it&#39;s it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.450" end="01:55:25.650" style="s2">child story element to it fact I suspect</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.150" end="01:55:27.330" style="s2">it probably was a story that was</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.650" end="01:55:30.090" style="s2">primarily told to children you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.330" end="01:55:32.310" style="s2">like a fable but it&#39;s a fable with Punch</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.090" end="01:55:35.460" style="s2">like the Pinocchio story is a fable with</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.310" end="01:55:37.710" style="s2">Punch it&#39;s like well yeah there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.460" end="01:55:40.260" style="s2">to be a flood there&#39;s always a flood</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.710" end="01:55:41.940" style="s2">there&#39;s always a flood so who are you if</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.260" end="01:55:43.350" style="s2">you want to get through the flood well</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.940" end="01:55:45.120" style="s2">then you&#39;re Noah you&#39;re the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.350" end="01:55:47.430" style="s2">builds the boat you&#39;re the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.120" end="01:55:49.140" style="s2">acts justly you&#39;re the thing that walks</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.430" end="01:55:51.450" style="s2">with God we already know what that means</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.140" end="01:55:53.310" style="s2">you identify with the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.450" end="01:55:56.070" style="s2">that&#39;s like Geppetto pointing to the</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.310" end="01:55:58.080" style="s2">star before the transformation process</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.070" end="01:56:00.030" style="s2">that occurs with Pinocchio it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.080" end="01:56:02.100" style="s2">identifying with the benevolent spirit</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.030" end="01:56:04.290" style="s2">of the state so you have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.100" end="01:56:05.850" style="s2">with the transcendent and the benevolent</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.290" end="01:56:07.830" style="s2">spirit of the state and you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.850" end="01:56:09.040" style="s2">identified with the capacity to generate</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.830" end="01:56:10.930" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.040" end="01:56:13.420" style="s2">of order and the reverse that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.930" end="01:56:15.670" style="s2">means to walk with God roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.420" end="01:56:18.250" style="s2">it&#39;s across all of those dimensions so</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.670" end="01:56:20.740" style="s2">what does that do it gives you the power</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.250" end="01:56:24.160" style="s2">to withstand the flood and to bring</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.740" end="01:56:26.620" style="s2">people and and and being itself and</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.160" end="01:56:29.710" style="s2">civilization along with you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.620" end="01:56:32.440" style="s2">the story of Noah so it&#39;s a precursor</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.710" end="01:56:35.050" style="s2">it&#39;s another Abel as a precursor to the</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.440" end="01:56:36.880" style="s2">idea of the redeeming Messiah right Noah</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.050" end="01:56:38.530" style="s2">is a precursor to the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.880" end="01:56:42.160" style="s2">redeeming Messiah you could think about</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.530" end="01:56:44.320" style="s2">the mask proto messiahs or proto meta</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.160" end="01:56:45.880" style="s2">Heroes something like that and they</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.320" end="01:56:47.890" style="s2">manifest themselves they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.880" end="01:56:50.650" style="s2">Giants that walked in the past and</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.890" end="01:56:54.190" style="s2">they&#39;re embodied their attempts embodied</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.650" end="01:56:55.690" style="s2">in story to elucidate the the triangle</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.190" end="01:56:57.460" style="s2">that&#39;s at the top of the pyramid right</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.690" end="01:57:01.150" style="s2">the eye that&#39;s at the top of the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.460" end="01:57:04.090" style="s2">so so I won&#39;t tell you the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.150" end="01:57:09.250" style="s2">Noah story because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.090" end="01:57:14.890" style="s2">necessary for us to to - to delve into</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.250" end="01:57:17.860" style="s2">the - the more narrative details but I</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.890" end="01:57:19.180" style="s2">do want - so it&#39;s a pretty rough I can</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.860" end="01:57:20.920" style="s2">point out it&#39;s a pretty rough story</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.180" end="01:57:22.300" style="s2">every living substance was destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.920" end="01:57:24.280" style="s2">which was upon the face of the ground</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.300" end="01:57:26.080" style="s2">both Man and cattle and creeping things</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.280" end="01:57:27.700" style="s2">in the fall of the heaven and they were</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.080" end="01:57:29.710" style="s2">destroyed from the earth and Noah only</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.700" end="01:57:31.450" style="s2">remained alive and they that were with</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.710" end="01:57:35.260" style="s2">him in the Ark it&#39;s a very terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.450" end="01:57:37.360" style="s2">story you know and and it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.260" end="01:57:41.860" style="s2">attending to because we are currently in</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.360" end="01:57:44.350" style="s2">a period of extreme chaos so okay so</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.860" end="01:57:46.240" style="s2">anyway this works out God&#39;s had enough</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.350" end="01:57:48.060" style="s2">he&#39;s killed is enough he&#39;s killed enough</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.240" end="01:57:50.800" style="s2">of everything it&#39;s a it&#39;s a traumatic</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.060" end="01:57:53.980" style="s2">occurrence we can put it that way the</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.800" end="01:57:56.560" style="s2">waters recede and God God is done for</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.980" end="01:58:01.150" style="s2">the time being and so then this is what</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.560" end="01:58:03.430" style="s2">happens at the end so the ark settle</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.150" end="01:58:05.770" style="s2">down there unloading it and creation is</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.430" end="01:58:09.100" style="s2">reborn and so then you think well what</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.770" end="01:58:11.680" style="s2">sets things right again between man and</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.100" end="01:58:13.900" style="s2">God and the story says that Noah built</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.680" end="01:58:15.520" style="s2">in our altar unto the Lord and took of</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.900" end="01:58:17.830" style="s2">every clean beast and of every clean</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.520" end="01:58:19.750" style="s2">fowl and offered burnt offerings on the</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.830" end="01:58:21.580" style="s2">altar so it&#39;s the same idea here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.750" end="01:58:22.750" style="s2">that the same idea that you started to</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.580" end="01:58:24.880" style="s2">see emerging in the Cain</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.750" end="01:58:26.260" style="s2">Abell story what is it that sets things</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.880" end="01:58:28.930" style="s2">right between man and God</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.260" end="01:58:31.570" style="s2">sacrifice so the flood comes then Noah</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.930" end="01:58:33.640" style="s2">makes the proper sacrifices right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.570" end="01:58:36.070" style="s2">part of reestablishing the proper order</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.640" end="01:58:38.440" style="s2">he makes the proper sacrifices and so</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.070" end="01:58:40.120" style="s2">God is happy with the sacrifices which</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.440" end="01:58:45.970" style="s2">is a good thing given that he&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.120" end="01:58:47.950" style="s2">ordinary and-and-and the Lord smelled a</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.970" end="01:58:49.690" style="s2">sweet savour so remember I told you</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.950" end="01:58:50.980" style="s2">before that the reason people thought</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.690" end="01:58:52.570" style="s2">that this would work was because the</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.980" end="01:58:55.000" style="s2">smoke would rise up and God would be</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.570" end="01:58:57.550" style="s2">able to detect whether or not the the</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.000" end="01:58:59.470" style="s2">sacrifice was of high quality well you</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.550" end="01:59:05.170" style="s2">have it written right there you know</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.470" end="01:59:07.660" style="s2">it&#39;s very concrete eyes dim egde of the</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.170" end="01:59:09.990" style="s2">archetypal spirit right the Lord smelled</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.660" end="01:59:12.520" style="s2">a sweet savour and said in his heart I</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.990" end="01:59:15.130" style="s2">will not curse the ground any more for</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.520" end="01:59:16.720" style="s2">man&#39;s sake for the imagination of man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.130" end="01:59:18.910" style="s2">heart is evil from this youth neither</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.720" end="01:59:20.800" style="s2">will i again smite any more every living</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.910" end="01:59:23.200" style="s2">thing as I have done that&#39;s pretty nice</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.800" end="01:59:26.290" style="s2">as Noah&#39;s sacrifice actually calms down</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.200" end="01:59:27.880" style="s2">God down to the point where he says well</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.290" end="01:59:31.420" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to wipe everything out</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.880" end="01:59:33.940" style="s2">again it&#39;s like well fair enough you</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.420" end="01:59:36.460" style="s2">know but it I would consider it somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.940" end="01:59:39.000" style="s2">of a tenuous contract because we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.460" end="01:59:42.160" style="s2">more than one example in the recent</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.000" end="01:59:45.490" style="s2">century where we came bloody close to</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.160" end="01:59:47.230" style="s2">wiping everything out again while the</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.490" end="01:59:48.670" style="s2">earth remains seedtime and harvest and</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.230" end="01:59:50.680" style="s2">cold in heat in summer and winter and</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.670" end="01:59:52.810" style="s2">day and night shall not cease</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.680" end="01:59:56.860" style="s2">neither again will i smite any more</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.810" end="02:00:03.880" style="s2">every living thing as I have done so all</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.860" end="02:00:05.380" style="s2">right so that&#39;s that he basically tells</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.880" end="02:00:08.530" style="s2">Noah the same thing again that he told</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.380" end="02:00:11.650" style="s2">Adam at the beginning of the Genesis</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.530" end="02:00:13.840" style="s2">story so fine and then he tells them a</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.650" end="02:00:15.730" style="s2">bunch of rules which I could go into but</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.840" end="02:00:18.120" style="s2">at the moment I won&#39;t but I want to show</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.730" end="02:00:18.120" style="s2">you that</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.180" end="02:00:26.150" style="s2">basically what God I guess I should do</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.520" end="02:00:27.650" style="s2">this to some degree God lays out a bunch</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.150" end="02:00:29.270" style="s2">of rules so you could think about it as</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.650" end="02:00:31.190" style="s2">a precursor to what happens in the story</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.270" end="02:00:33.200" style="s2">of Exodus where the Ten Commandments are</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.190" end="02:00:36.110" style="s2">revealed so this is like a foreshadowing</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.200" end="02:00:38.240" style="s2">of that story no one makes the proper</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.110" end="02:00:40.580" style="s2">sacrifices and God says okay fine here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.240" end="02:00:42.710" style="s2">the rules follow these rules and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.580" end="02:00:44.240" style="s2">they&#39;re laid out and things will go okay</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.710" end="02:00:45.800" style="s2">with you that&#39;s the covenant that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.240" end="02:00:47.030" style="s2">agreement between the end you could say</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.800" end="02:00:48.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the agreement between the</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.030" end="02:00:50.630" style="s2">individual and the spirit of the state</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.890" end="02:00:52.760" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of looking at but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.630" end="02:00:54.770" style="s2">not enough because it isn&#39;t merely the</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.760" end="02:00:56.840" style="s2">spirit of the state that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.770" end="02:00:59.030" style="s2">negotiated with it&#39;s the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.840" end="02:01:01.070" style="s2">state it&#39;s the spirit of that which</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.030" end="02:01:02.900" style="s2">transcends the state and it&#39;s the spirit</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.070" end="02:01:04.520" style="s2">of the moral order that&#39;s within the</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.900" end="02:01:06.620" style="s2">individual all three of those things are</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.520" end="02:01:08.720" style="s2">being negotiated simultaneously the</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.620" end="02:01:11.450" style="s2">proper sacrifices are made the proper</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.720" end="02:01:13.220" style="s2">rules are laid out and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.450" end="02:01:15.290" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a good balance between order</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.220" end="02:01:17.120" style="s2">and chaos as a consequence as long as</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.290" end="02:01:20.420" style="s2">people continue to play by the rules so</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.120" end="02:01:25.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the offerin fundamentally so part</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.420" end="02:01:27.620" style="s2">that seems to work out and then this one</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.700" end="02:01:30.740" style="s2">I think is extremely interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.620" end="02:01:35.290" style="s2">also very short it took me a very very</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.740" end="02:01:35.290" style="s2">long time to to understand this</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.650" end="02:01:43.660" style="s2">all right so this is after the story of</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.720" end="02:01:45.310" style="s2">Noah so what happens is you get this</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.660" end="02:01:46.870" style="s2">situation where things descend into</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.310" end="02:01:48.280" style="s2">chaos and there&#39;s a great flood so</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.870" end="02:01:51.910" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of like the ultimate chaos</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.280" end="02:01:53.710" style="s2">story and I think of it as it there so</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.910" end="02:01:56.310" style="s2">you imagine when things fall apart one</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.710" end="02:02:00.180" style="s2">possibility is that they fall into chaos</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.310" end="02:02:05.380" style="s2">the other possibility is something like</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.180" end="02:02:07.300" style="s2">they become hyper conceptualized in</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.380" end="02:02:09.010" style="s2">hyper orderly and so then the state</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.300" end="02:02:11.110" style="s2">itself which would be the antidote to</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.010" end="02:02:13.450" style="s2">chaos actually becomes a source of</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.110" end="02:02:15.280" style="s2">pathology and I think that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.450" end="02:02:17.890" style="s2">being hinted at in the story of the</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.280" end="02:02:20.200" style="s2">Tower of Babel so here&#39;s what happens is</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.890" end="02:02:22.420" style="s2">that human beings I&#39;ll read it to you</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.200" end="02:02:24.100" style="s2">this is this has to do with Noah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.420" end="02:02:26.260" style="s2">descendants it&#39;s a flip into another</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.100" end="02:02:29.100" style="s2">story and it came to pass as they</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.260" end="02:02:32.080" style="s2">journeyed from the east oh yes</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.100" end="02:02:35.170" style="s2">and all the days of Noah were 950 years</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.080" end="02:02:37.860" style="s2">and he died news story and the whole</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.170" end="02:02:40.540" style="s2">earth was of one language and one speech</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.860" end="02:02:42.280" style="s2">everybody&#39;s getting along fine in their</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.540" end="02:02:44.320" style="s2">tribal organization let&#39;s say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.280" end="02:02:45.400" style="s2">homogenous they can all speak to one</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.320" end="02:02:48.280" style="s2">another and they all speak the same</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.400" end="02:02:49.420" style="s2">language and it came to pass as they</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.280" end="02:02:51.670" style="s2">journeyed from the east that they found</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.420" end="02:02:52.870" style="s2">a plain in the land of Shinar and they</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.670" end="02:02:55.600" style="s2">dwelt there and they said to one another</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.870" end="02:02:57.400" style="s2">go to let us make brick and burn them</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.600" end="02:03:00.280" style="s2">thoroughly and they had brick for stone</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.400" end="02:03:04.720" style="s2">and slime had they for mortar and they</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.280" end="02:03:07.210" style="s2">said go to go to let us build a city and</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.720" end="02:03:09.880" style="s2">a tower whose top may reach unto heaven</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.210" end="02:03:11.470" style="s2">and let us make a name lest we be</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.880" end="02:03:11.950" style="s2">scattered abroad upon the face of the</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.470" end="02:03:19.690" style="s2">whole earth</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.950" end="02:03:22.330" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s happening here only the</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.690" end="02:03:24.820" style="s2">bear this is this what this story means</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.330" end="02:03:26.410" style="s2">is very deeply implicit in the story</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.820" end="02:03:28.480" style="s2">it&#39;s hinting at it and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.410" end="02:03:30.640" style="s2">because it was really beyond the power</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.480" end="02:03:32.830" style="s2">of the conceptualization of the people</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.640" end="02:03:34.750" style="s2">who generated this story to elaborate it</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.830" end="02:03:38.800" style="s2">to any great detail but I think what it</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.750" end="02:03:41.470" style="s2">means is this is that there&#39;s a guy</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.800" end="02:03:43.870" style="s2">named Robin I think it&#39;s Robin Dunbar</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.470" end="02:03:48.070" style="s2">and one of the things that Dunbar has</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.870" end="02:03:50.560" style="s2">done is do a very in detail correlation</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.070" end="02:03:52.570" style="s2">analysis of cortical expansion and group</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.560" end="02:03:57.070" style="s2">size and what he showed is</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.570" end="02:03:59.349" style="s2">that if you if you plot primates by</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.070" end="02:04:01.719" style="s2">cortical size let&#39;s say you corrected</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.349" end="02:04:03.880" style="s2">for body size you plot primates by</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.719" end="02:04:05.920" style="s2">cortical size and then you plot the size</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.880" end="02:04:07.840" style="s2">of their social groups you see a very</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.920" end="02:04:09.369" style="s2">tight relationship between the size of</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.840" end="02:04:11.500" style="s2">the social group and the size of the</p>

<p begin="02:04:11.500" end="02:04:14.260" style="s2">like two hundred individuals is</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.880" end="02:04:15.969" style="s2">something like that which is maybe</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.260" end="02:04:18.400" style="s2">roughly the number of people that you</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.969" end="02:04:20.139" style="s2">can reasonably track on Facebook after</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.400" end="02:04:21.099" style="s2">that it&#39;s like well there&#39;s names but</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.139" end="02:04:24.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t know those people</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.099" end="02:04:25.900" style="s2">you&#39;re not capable of tracking social</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.040" end="02:04:27.250" style="s2">dynamics there any more complex than</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.900" end="02:04:29.380" style="s2">that particles you have other problems</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.250" end="02:04:30.820" style="s2">to solve and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.380" end="02:04:33.340" style="s2">has been observed is that human groups</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.820" end="02:04:35.380" style="s2">tend to fractionate if they start to</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.340" end="02:04:36.760" style="s2">exceed 200 and maybe that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.380" end="02:04:38.110" style="s2">because you can&#39;t keep track of the</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.760" end="02:04:40.000" style="s2">complexity but there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.110" end="02:04:41.860" style="s2">constraint which is you want your group</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.000" end="02:04:43.929" style="s2">to be big enough so that it protects you</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.860" end="02:04:46.420" style="s2">but you want it to be small enough so</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.929" end="02:04:47.829" style="s2">that you can climb to the top because so</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.420" end="02:04:51.909" style="s2">when the group gets really really really</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.829" end="02:04:53.500" style="s2">really big well maybe it can protect you</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.909" end="02:04:55.929" style="s2">although it also doesn&#39;t give a damn</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.500" end="02:04:57.699" style="s2">about you like once you&#39;re 160</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.929" end="02:04:59.679" style="s2">thousandth of the group like you are at</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.699" end="02:05:03.040" style="s2">the University of Toronto we&#39;re 130</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.679" end="02:05:05.349" style="s2">millionth of the country or maybe 1 300</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.040" end="02:05:06.790" style="s2">millionth of Europe which is partly why</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.349" end="02:05:09.040" style="s2">Europe is going to fragment because</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.790" end="02:05:11.650" style="s2">that&#39;s just not enough right you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.040" end="02:05:13.360" style="s2">not enough there that this the group is</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.650" end="02:05:16.599" style="s2">too big what happens</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.360" end="02:05:18.130" style="s2">you keep aggregating the group it gets</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.599" end="02:05:19.719" style="s2">more and more powerful and you can think</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.130" end="02:05:22.179" style="s2">of that as something that has the</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.719" end="02:05:24.790" style="s2">capacity to replace the transcendent</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.179" end="02:05:26.619" style="s2">right will make a society that&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.790" end="02:05:28.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like a utopian vision that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.619" end="02:05:30.250" style="s2">see happening in this story it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.119" end="02:05:32.079" style="s2">we&#39;ll make something so great on the</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.250" end="02:05:33.969" style="s2">part of human beings that it will reach</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.079" end="02:05:35.500" style="s2">up to heaven itself which means it will</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.969" end="02:05:37.869" style="s2">take the place of God that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.500" end="02:05:39.190" style="s2">means that&#39;s exactly what the Communists</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.869" end="02:05:41.409" style="s2">did in Soviet Russia that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.190" end="02:05:43.000" style="s2">tried to do in China too and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.409" end="02:05:45.730" style="s2">why you ended up with people like Stalin</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.000" end="02:05:49.480" style="s2">as the God so you talk about getting</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.730" end="02:05:52.659" style="s2">what you deserve so anyways so you build</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.480" end="02:05:54.250" style="s2">these monolithic enterprises that will</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.659" end="02:05:56.440" style="s2">let&#39;s call them state enterprises and</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.250" end="02:05:59.139" style="s2">the idea there is that the state the</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.440" end="02:06:01.900" style="s2">hyper organized and all-inclusive state</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.139" end="02:06:04.150" style="s2">can bring about Utopia that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.900" end="02:06:06.040" style="s2">means to reach to heaven so what happens</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.150" end="02:06:09.160" style="s2">so god gets wind of that</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.040" end="02:06:11.440" style="s2">and he says blood says the Lord came</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.160" end="02:06:13.690" style="s2">down see the city in the tower which the</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.440" end="02:06:16.180" style="s2">children of men built and the Lord said</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.690" end="02:06:17.830" style="s2">Behold the people is one and now they</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.180" end="02:06:20.140" style="s2">all have one language and this they</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.830" end="02:06:22.000" style="s2">begin to do and now nothing will be</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.140" end="02:06:25.810" style="s2">restrained from them which they have</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.000" end="02:06:27.040" style="s2">imagined to do go to let us go down and</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.810" end="02:06:28.630" style="s2">therefore confound their language that</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.040" end="02:06:29.380" style="s2">they may not understand one another&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.630" end="02:06:30.850" style="s2">speech</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.380" end="02:06:32.950" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.850" end="02:06:34.930" style="s2">the story kind of portrays it as</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.950" end="02:06:37.300" style="s2">jealousy on God&#39;s part right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.930" end="02:06:39.760" style="s2">oh these these human beings they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.300" end="02:06:41.260" style="s2">they&#39;re building so magnificently that</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.760" end="02:06:43.510" style="s2">they&#39;re starting to challenge my</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.260" end="02:06:44.650" style="s2">Dominion well I&#39;m going to go down there</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.510" end="02:06:46.150" style="s2">and play a trick or two law on them and</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.650" end="02:06:49.450" style="s2">that&#39;ll that&#39;ll take care of that so</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.150" end="02:06:50.650" style="s2">what happens the people within the so</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.450" end="02:06:52.210" style="s2">the group gets bigger and bigger and</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.650" end="02:06:54.610" style="s2">bigger and bigger and bigger and what</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.210" end="02:06:56.680" style="s2">happens it starts to fragment that is</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.610" end="02:06:58.810" style="s2">what happens that&#39;s exactly what happens</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.680" end="02:07:01.930" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason why the</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.810" end="02:07:04.120" style="s2">totalitarian state enterprise to replace</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.930" end="02:07:05.860" style="s2">the transcendent with structure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.120" end="02:07:07.630" style="s2">one of the reasons it&#39;s doomed as you</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.860" end="02:07:09.430" style="s2">pull more and more people in what</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.630" end="02:07:11.560" style="s2">happens is you start to pull in chaos</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.430" end="02:07:13.480" style="s2">itself and that starts to fragment the</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.560" end="02:07:16.630" style="s2">order here is an interesting thing I</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.480" end="02:07:20.710" style="s2">think that&#39;s happening with the soul the</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.630" end="02:07:22.300" style="s2">LGBT power groups are exclusion excluded</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.710" end="02:07:24.850" style="s2">groups right and so it started out with</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.300" end="02:07:26.350" style="s2">gay rights and then one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.850" end="02:07:27.520" style="s2">that&#39;s happened it&#39;s so interesting so</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.350" end="02:07:30.160" style="s2">you could think of there was a normative</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.520" end="02:07:32.650" style="s2">group and there was excluded people okay</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.160" end="02:07:34.900" style="s2">and so one section of the excluded</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.650" end="02:07:36.940" style="s2">people stood up and said hey you know</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.900" end="02:07:38.710" style="s2">enough of this explosion so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.940" end="02:07:41.170" style="s2">to categorize ourselves and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.710" end="02:07:43.960" style="s2">to fight for recognition as the excluded</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.170" end="02:07:45.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to fight to be included but</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.960" end="02:07:47.620" style="s2">what happens is well it&#39;s L and then</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.640" end="02:07:50.680" style="s2">it&#39;s lb and then it&#39;s lb G and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.620" end="02:07:52.300" style="s2">LGBT and the last thing I saw which was</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.680" end="02:07:54.340" style="s2">actually handed to the medical students</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.300" end="02:08:01.600" style="s2">in at the University of Toronto there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.340" end="02:08:04.060" style="s2">20 letters why well because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.600" end="02:08:06.250" style="s2">this is tangentially related to this</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.060" end="02:08:08.260" style="s2">story only you can&#39;t come up with a</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.250" end="02:08:10.450" style="s2">category of the things that don&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.260" end="02:08:11.950" style="s2">inside categories because there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.450" end="02:08:14.020" style="s2">infinite number of things that don&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.950" end="02:08:17.140" style="s2">inside categories and so when you try to</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.020" end="02:08:19.300" style="s2">build a category out of all uncatted</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.140" end="02:08:21.309" style="s2">oracle entities all that happens is</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.300" end="02:08:23.199" style="s2">defragment because there&#39;s actually no</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.309" end="02:08:24.489" style="s2">unity there and one of the things you</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.199" end="02:08:26.800" style="s2">are starting to see is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.489" end="02:08:28.630" style="s2">power battles emerging on the part of</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.800" end="02:08:30.790" style="s2">the excluded on the left and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.630" end="02:08:32.590" style="s2">inevitable because and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.790" end="02:08:35.260" style="s2">what this story is trying to represent</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.590" end="02:08:38.440" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t build the state up</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.260" end="02:08:40.210" style="s2">beyond a certain size if you Delia will</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.440" end="02:08:41.679" style="s2">fragment and fall apart the people</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.210" end="02:08:43.449" style="s2">within it will no longer speak the same</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.679" end="02:08:45.429" style="s2">language and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.449" end="02:08:47.469" style="s2">disperse themselves to different corners</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.429" end="02:08:49.329" style="s2">of the earth and so I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.469" end="02:08:51.099" style="s2">actually in real danger of forgetting</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.329" end="02:08:54.219" style="s2">this and one of the things that I saw</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.099" end="02:08:56.020" style="s2">read a couple of ominous things so if</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.219" end="02:08:57.550" style="s2">you plot the size of economic</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.020" end="02:09:00.520" style="s2">catastrophes over the last thirty years</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.550" end="02:09:02.409" style="s2">they&#39;re getting bigger each time so</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.520" end="02:09:04.119" style="s2">that&#39;s scary now part of that is because</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.409" end="02:09:05.889" style="s2">the world economy is getting bigger and</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.119" end="02:09:08.469" style="s2">so maybe you have to control for that</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.889" end="02:09:16.480" style="s2">but the magnitude of the chaos has been</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.469" end="02:09:18.250" style="s2">increasing with each collapse okay one</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.480" end="02:09:21.059" style="s2">of the things that came out of the last</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.250" end="02:09:23.710" style="s2">collapse 2008 was the government</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.059" end="02:09:25.840" style="s2">rescuing collapsed companies like AIG</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.710" end="02:09:26.889" style="s2">and the Royal Bank of Scotland which by</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.840" end="02:09:28.809" style="s2">the way was the biggest company in the</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.889" end="02:09:30.190" style="s2">world no one knows that but Royal Bank</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.809" end="02:09:32.260" style="s2">of Scotland collapsed it was the biggest</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.190" end="02:09:32.980" style="s2">company in the world and AIG was the</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.260" end="02:09:36.099" style="s2">insurer</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.980" end="02:09:37.630" style="s2">of insurers and so it collapsed too they</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.099" end="02:09:38.440" style="s2">were rescued by the government and maybe</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.630" end="02:09:41.619" style="s2">fair enough</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.440" end="02:09:45.420" style="s2">but one of the motifs that came out of</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.619" end="02:09:48.969" style="s2">that was the idea of too big to fail</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.420" end="02:09:53.920" style="s2">well this story says wait a second it</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.969" end="02:09:56.260" style="s2">says too big means definite failure it</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.920" end="02:09:57.820" style="s2">means inevitable failure and that</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.260" end="02:10:00.639" style="s2">strikes me as highly probable is that</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.820" end="02:10:03.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a warning in this story although</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.639" end="02:10:05.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s a bear story right</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.340" end="02:10:07.179" style="s2">it&#39;s only four or five lines it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.110" end="02:10:08.889" style="s2">the outlines but it&#39;s placed in a very</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.179" end="02:10:10.869" style="s2">particular place it&#39;s placed right after</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.889" end="02:10:12.820" style="s2">the flood right it&#39;s like well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.869" end="02:10:14.469" style="s2">the nihilistic chaos of the flood and</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.820" end="02:10:16.840" style="s2">then there&#39;s the temp totalitarian</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.469" end="02:10:19.090" style="s2">temptation to build hyper structures</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.840" end="02:10:21.010" style="s2">that can theoretically replace the</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.090" end="02:10:22.449" style="s2">transcendent well what happens you build</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.010" end="02:10:24.460" style="s2">a hyper structure net fragments from</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.449" end="02:10:26.139" style="s2">within and then people don&#39;t speak the</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.460" end="02:10:27.460" style="s2">same language and they and they you know</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.139" end="02:10:29.190" style="s2">distribute themselves sort of</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.460" end="02:10:32.190" style="s2">chaotically on the surface of the earth</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.190" end="02:10:32.190" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.540" end="02:10:38.340" style="s2">therefore is the name of it called Babel</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.430" end="02:10:40.230" style="s2">because the Lord did there confound the</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.340" end="02:10:41.460" style="s2">language of all the earth and from</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.230" end="02:10:43.650" style="s2">thence did the Lord scattered them</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.460" end="02:10:45.530" style="s2">abroad upon the face of all the earth I</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.650" end="02:10:48.450" style="s2">think the other issue too is is that</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.530" end="02:10:50.970" style="s2">what&#39;s the problem with the homogenize a</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.450" end="02:10:52.170" style="s2">ssin of a group it&#39;s like you bring</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.970" end="02:10:54.630" style="s2">everyone into the group and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.170" end="02:10:56.810" style="s2">all the same uniformity well the</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.630" end="02:10:59.280" style="s2">advantages you can understand everyone</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.810" end="02:11:00.960" style="s2">the disadvantages there&#39;s no variability</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.280" end="02:11:03.300" style="s2">left right there&#39;s no variability</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.960" end="02:11:05.190" style="s2">everyone is a clone of everyone else and</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.300" end="02:11:06.480" style="s2">that&#39;s great if you know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.190" end="02:11:08.280" style="s2">going and you know how to get there but</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.480" end="02:11:11.490" style="s2">it&#39;s really really bad if the underlying</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.280" end="02:11:13.170" style="s2">structure shifts on you because the fact</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.490" end="02:11:15.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re adapted to one situation</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.170" end="02:11:18.180" style="s2">hyper adapted to one situation might</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.720" end="02:11:20.940" style="s2">mean that you&#39;re content completely not</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.180" end="02:11:22.110" style="s2">adapted to the next situation you build</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.940" end="02:11:25.470" style="s2">groups that are too big and too</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.110" end="02:11:27.660" style="s2">homogenous they&#39;re effective but only</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.470" end="02:11:29.370" style="s2">within the limited range of their map</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.660" end="02:11:31.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s the map no longer functions</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.370" end="02:11:32.610" style="s2">then the whole thing sinks and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.290" end="02:11:34.530" style="s2">think what happens in this particular</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.610" end="02:11:36.570" style="s2">story and then okay at the end of that</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.530" end="02:11:38.160" style="s2">then what happens is that soon</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.570" end="02:11:40.020" style="s2">afterwards and I think perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.160" end="02:11:42.720" style="s2">immediately afterwards the story of</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.020" end="02:11:46.680" style="s2">Abraham emerges and that&#39;s really I</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.720" end="02:11:49.980" style="s2">would say that&#39;s when the the prime</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.680" end="02:11:52.290" style="s2">myths the primal myths take on a more</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.980" end="02:11:54.150" style="s2">historical element and history you know</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.290" end="02:11:57.180" style="s2">roughly speaking history as we know it</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.150" end="02:11:59.460" style="s2">begins something like 6,000 years ago so</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.180" end="02:12:01.020" style="s2">and then then you know the rest of the</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.460" end="02:12:03.050" style="s2">biblical stories proceed apace from</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.020" end="02:12:05.190" style="s2">there what basically happens is that</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.050" end="02:12:07.440" style="s2">this is something that was well mapped</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.190" end="02:12:09.420" style="s2">out by Northrop Frye and you&#39;d think at</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.440" end="02:12:11.100" style="s2">the University of Toronto that you all</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.420" end="02:12:12.870" style="s2">would have been encouraged to read</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.100" end="02:12:14.280" style="s2">Northrop Frye because he was perhaps the</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.870" end="02:12:17.330" style="s2">greatest literary scholar that the</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.280" end="02:12:20.280" style="s2">University of Toronto ever produced and</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.330" end="02:12:21.810" style="s2">what he he outlined the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.280" end="02:12:23.940" style="s2">very interestingly he said that what</p>
<p begin="02:12:21.810" end="02:12:27.360" style="s2">happens after these initial stories is</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.940" end="02:12:29.100" style="s2">that the state arises so it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.360" end="02:12:31.860" style="s2">Tower of Babel is continually rebuilt</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.100" end="02:12:33.900" style="s2">over and over it&#39;s the state of Israel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.860" end="02:12:37.350" style="s2">Israelis Israelite to get their act</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.900" end="02:12:39.090" style="s2">together build a state what happens they</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.350" end="02:12:40.770" style="s2">get corrupt the Prophet comes up and</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.090" end="02:12:42.390" style="s2">says you better watch out because what</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.770" end="02:12:44.550" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is not making God happy and</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.390" end="02:12:46.470" style="s2">the prophets are very brave because they</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.550" end="02:12:48.390" style="s2">come forward that the case are</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.470" end="02:12:50.300" style="s2">authoritarian they could kill them at an</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.390" end="02:12:53.100" style="s2">instant but the profits are moved by</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.300" end="02:12:54.270" style="s2">walking with God let&#39;s say for lack of a</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.100" end="02:12:56.160" style="s2">better argument they come to the king</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.270" end="02:12:58.350" style="s2">and say look you&#39;re not caring for the</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.160" end="02:12:59.700" style="s2">widows and the children right you think</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.350" end="02:13:00.450" style="s2">that&#39;s okay because they&#39;re weak it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.700" end="02:13:02.760" style="s2">not okay</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.450" end="02:13:04.890" style="s2">you&#39;re breaking the Covenant you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.760" end="02:13:06.720" style="s2">breaking the rules and the price for</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.890" end="02:13:08.160" style="s2">that is what we&#39;re Esau the price for</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.720" end="02:13:10.110" style="s2">that is the flood it&#39;s like get your act</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.160" end="02:13:12.390" style="s2">together or you&#39;re going to be sorry now</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.110" end="02:13:14.610" style="s2">sometimes the Kings to whom the prophets</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.390" end="02:13:15.870" style="s2">speak listen but often they don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.610" end="02:13:18.210" style="s2">then the whole bloody state is</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.870" end="02:13:20.010" style="s2">demolished and then the Israelites are</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.210" end="02:13:21.930" style="s2">back like they&#39;re enslaved or they get</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.010" end="02:13:23.880" style="s2">wiped out by their enemies or like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.930" end="02:13:26.160" style="s2">a complete bloody catastrophe that lasts</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.880" end="02:13:28.440" style="s2">for centuries then they kind of struggle</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.160" end="02:13:30.120" style="s2">back up and make another state and then</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.440" end="02:13:31.590" style="s2">they get arrogant and then it gets</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.120" end="02:13:33.570" style="s2">corrupt and then a prophet comes along</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.590" end="02:13:35.790" style="s2">and says you know what happened last</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.570" end="02:13:37.590" style="s2">time like well that was 600 years ago</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.790" end="02:13:38.850" style="s2">right and I know everything now so I</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.590" end="02:13:41.910" style="s2">don&#39;t have to pay any attention to you</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.850" end="02:13:43.620" style="s2">it&#39;s they ignore it and then because and</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.910" end="02:13:45.990" style="s2">the prophets say you are violating a</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.620" end="02:13:48.060" style="s2">fundamental moral order you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.990" end="02:13:50.790" style="s2">to as king you&#39;re supposed to be subject</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.060" end="02:13:51.810" style="s2">to something higher than yourself right</p>
<p begin="02:13:50.790" end="02:13:53.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like the idea that the</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.810" end="02:13:55.950" style="s2">Mesopotamians had that the emperor was</p>
<p begin="02:13:53.940" end="02:13:58.050" style="s2">supposed to be an emissary of Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.950" end="02:14:00.030" style="s2">that&#39;s why he was the Emperor because he</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.050" end="02:14:02.190" style="s2">was a good Marduk he could confront</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.030" end="02:14:04.020" style="s2">chaos and make order that was what gave</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.190" end="02:14:05.940" style="s2">him his sovereignty or the Egyptian</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.020" end="02:14:07.920" style="s2">pharaoh was a combination of Osiris and</p>
<p begin="02:14:05.940" end="02:14:10.170" style="s2">Horus that&#39;s what gave him sovereignty</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.920" end="02:14:13.200" style="s2">and so the idea was you get to be king</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.170" end="02:14:16.290" style="s2">but you have to act out the spirit of</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.200" end="02:14:20.160" style="s2">being King and if you don&#39;t do that then</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.290" end="02:14:22.200" style="s2">well King or not all hell&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.160" end="02:14:23.550" style="s2">break loose for you and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.200" end="02:14:25.050" style="s2">prophets continued to say but the</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.550" end="02:14:26.310" style="s2">Israelites you know they don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.050" end="02:14:28.650" style="s2">enough attention and they continue to</p>
<p begin="02:14:26.310" end="02:14:30.690" style="s2">get absolutely demolished and so the Old</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.650" end="02:14:33.960" style="s2">Testament can be read at least in part</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.690" end="02:14:36.120" style="s2">as the description of a sequence of the</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.960" end="02:14:39.110" style="s2">rise and fall of States and their</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.120" end="02:14:41.820" style="s2">descent into corruption and chaos and so</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.110" end="02:14:43.260" style="s2">we&#39;ll leave it at that because I want to</p>
<p begin="02:14:41.820" end="02:14:44.730" style="s2">tell you the next part of the story the</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.260" end="02:14:47.040" style="s2">last part of the story roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="02:14:44.730" end="02:14:51.390" style="s2">in our next lecture which is also the</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.040" end="02:14:53.790" style="s2">last lecture so we&#39;ve got about 12</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.390" end="02:14:56.070" style="s2">minutes if we want it so if anybody has</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.790" end="02:14:57.840" style="s2">any questions you can ask them or we can</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.070" end="02:14:58.510" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t then we could call it a</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.840" end="02:15:02.980" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.510" end="02:15:05.770" style="s2">so does any well it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.980" end="02:15:07.750" style="s2">information so and it&#39;s a lot of strange</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.770" end="02:15:21.070" style="s2">information so I&#39;m curious you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.750" end="02:15:24.310" style="s2">if it what do you make of it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.070" end="02:15:28.360" style="s2">talking about Europe around eternity so</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.310" end="02:15:32.560" style="s2">why is why the group war side which is</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.360" end="02:15:33.970" style="s2">America is related fate you think the</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.560" end="02:15:35.170" style="s2">right and left can talk to each other</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.970" end="02:15:38.350" style="s2">sure you think they speak the same</p>

<p begin="02:15:42.370" end="02:15:45.610" style="s2">languages they&#39;re they really are</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.050" end="02:15:47.440" style="s2">speaking different languages it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.610" end="02:15:49.780" style="s2">right way of thinking about it yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:15:47.440" end="02:15:51.880" style="s2">very very dangerous you know I think the</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.780" end="02:15:53.380" style="s2">u.s. worked for a long time first of all</p>
<p begin="02:15:51.880" end="02:15:55.510" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t always have 300</p>
<p begin="02:15:53.380" end="02:15:59.140" style="s2">million people it&#39;s a lot of people to</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.510" end="02:16:00.790" style="s2">put under one umbrella now the utility</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.140" end="02:16:03.580" style="s2">of the American system is that it is a</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.790" end="02:16:06.790" style="s2">hierarchy right there&#39;s individuals</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.580" end="02:16:08.830" style="s2">families towns States underneath a</p>
<p begin="02:16:06.790" end="02:16:11.410" style="s2">somewhat loose federal structure and</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.830" end="02:16:13.360" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of so it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.410" end="02:16:15.070" style="s2">monolith where everyone has to speak</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.360" end="02:16:16.720" style="s2">precisely the same language it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.070" end="02:16:18.820" style="s2">some flexibility built into its</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.720" end="02:16:21.670" style="s2">structure because it&#39;s it&#39;s come it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.820" end="02:16:23.950" style="s2">it&#39;s formulated into components which</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.670" end="02:16:25.420" style="s2">have a certain amount of autonomy and so</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.950" end="02:16:27.430" style="s2">far that&#39;s worked sufficiently well</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.420" end="02:16:29.200" style="s2">whether it will and it will probably</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.430" end="02:16:31.450" style="s2">continue to work I mean the Americans</p>
<p begin="02:16:29.200" end="02:16:33.190" style="s2">are very very robust people and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:16:31.450" end="02:16:34.510" style="s2">gone through things that are analogous</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.190" end="02:16:39.160" style="s2">to what they&#39;re going through now many</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.510" end="02:16:41.469" style="s2">times god only knows right but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.160" end="02:16:42.940" style="s2">very dangerous thing to presume that the</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.469" end="02:16:45.099" style="s2">Americans are down for the count because</p>
<p begin="02:16:42.940" end="02:16:46.660" style="s2">they have an uncanny ability to rise out</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.099" end="02:16:48.610" style="s2">from mash is even stronger than they</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.660" end="02:16:50.530" style="s2">were before but you can certainly see</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.610" end="02:16:52.090" style="s2">the danger lurking in Europe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.530" end="02:16:54.370" style="s2">that&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.090" end="02:16:56.800" style="s2">like I think the European state is</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.370" end="02:17:00.130" style="s2">doomed because I think it grew too fast</p>
<p begin="02:16:56.800" end="02:17:03.210" style="s2">and it severed the connection between</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.130" end="02:17:05.800" style="s2">like there&#39;s not the proper hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.210" end="02:17:07.840" style="s2">identification so and people are saying</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.800" end="02:17:09.969" style="s2">wait Brussels like who the hell are you</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.840" end="02:17:11.770" style="s2">guys why are you making decisions for us</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.969" end="02:17:13.810" style="s2">and we don&#39;t agree with your decision</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.770" end="02:17:15.910" style="s2">and like are you sure that Greece and</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.810" end="02:17:18.880" style="s2">Germany can be in the same place because</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.910" end="02:17:20.350" style="s2">that&#39;s by no means self-evident right</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.880" end="02:17:21.940" style="s2">the Germans aren&#39;t very happy about it</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.350" end="02:17:24.640" style="s2">and the Greeks aren&#39;t very happy about</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.940" end="02:17:26.320" style="s2">it and one of the rules for making an</p>
<p begin="02:17:24.640" end="02:17:28.630" style="s2">organization is that it&#39;s a lot easier</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.320" end="02:17:30.880" style="s2">to make a functional organization worse</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.630" end="02:17:33.220" style="s2">than it is to make a dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.880" end="02:17:35.320" style="s2">organization better and so you might say</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.220" end="02:17:37.270" style="s2">well you&#39;ve got Germany and France and</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.320" end="02:17:39.460" style="s2">England well let&#39;s say Germany and</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.270" end="02:17:43.410" style="s2">France powerhouses especially Germany</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.460" end="02:17:47.830" style="s2">they can afford to bring Greece in well</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.410" end="02:17:50.080" style="s2">maybe but there&#39;s no evidence that they</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.830" end="02:17:51.790" style="s2">can afford it so I mean Greece is</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.080" end="02:17:53.710" style="s2">unbelievably corrupt no one pays their</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.790" end="02:17:57.220" style="s2">income tax that&#39;s a big problem right</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.710" end="02:18:00.100" style="s2">and bringing them in to a union at a</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.220" end="02:18:02.470" style="s2">high order has no effect whatsoever on</p>
<p begin="02:18:00.100" end="02:18:04.570" style="s2">the micro behaviors and the thing is the</p>
<p begin="02:18:02.470" end="02:18:05.860" style="s2">micro behaviors have to be rectified and</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.570" end="02:18:07.540" style="s2">no one really knows how to do that how</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.860" end="02:18:09.640" style="s2">do you stop a country where people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.540" end="02:18:12.580" style="s2">pay their taxes from how do you stop</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.640" end="02:18:15.610" style="s2">people from not paying their taxes why</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.580" end="02:18:17.350" style="s2">do we pay our taxes who knows we could</p>
<p begin="02:18:15.610" end="02:18:18.520" style="s2">just all of a sudden decide not to you</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.350" end="02:18:20.020" style="s2">know and the government wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.520" end="02:18:22.210" style="s2">the resources to run around gathering</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.020" end="02:18:24.940" style="s2">them all up for one reason or another</p>
<p begin="02:18:22.210" end="02:18:26.650" style="s2">it&#39;s become customary for people in</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.940" end="02:18:31.570" style="s2">functional Western democracies to pay</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.650" end="02:18:33.010" style="s2">their taxes but why who knows it</p>
<p begin="02:18:31.570" end="02:18:35.080" style="s2">would&#39;ve been way easier for us just to</p>
<p begin="02:18:33.010" end="02:18:38.920" style="s2">do what the Greeks did and pretend to</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.080" end="02:18:41.770" style="s2">pay them you know so they&#39;re too big I</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.920" end="02:18:43.540" style="s2">think and so the people on the right is</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.770" end="02:18:46.170" style="s2">saying back to the nation like I</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.540" end="02:18:50.530" style="s2">understand why they&#39;re doing that but</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.170" end="02:18:53.020" style="s2">but the danger is the nation will</p>
<p begin="02:18:50.530" end="02:18:54.880" style="s2">subordinate the individual and I do see</p>
<p begin="02:18:53.020" end="02:18:58.570" style="s2">it as another example of safe spaces</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.880" end="02:19:02.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just scales different so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.570" end="02:19:03.910" style="s2">why I think that the proper antidote to</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.110" end="02:19:05.800" style="s2">that to both the chaos on the left and</p>
<p begin="02:19:03.910" end="02:19:07.720" style="s2">the order on the right roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.800" end="02:19:09.790" style="s2">is to walk the proper line in the middle</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.720" end="02:19:12.250" style="s2">and when we better do that because</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.790" end="02:19:15.970" style="s2">things are not things are too chaotic at</p>
<p begin="02:19:12.250" end="02:19:18.670" style="s2">the moment so it&#39;s not good maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.970" end="02:19:20.560" style="s2">really good that&#39;s possible but we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.670" end="02:19:23.980" style="s2">a state where I really believe we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.560" end="02:19:24.850" style="s2">a state where things could go any number</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.980" end="02:19:27.131" style="s2">of ways and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.850" end="02:19:30.430" style="s2">no there&#39;s no predicting it so and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.131" end="02:19:32.440" style="s2">never felt that you know I mean I lived</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.430" end="02:19:34.390" style="s2">in the 80s and you know political</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.440" end="02:19:35.890" style="s2">correctness rose up in the 90s as well</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.390" end="02:19:37.631" style="s2">and I can remember a lot of what</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.890" end="02:19:39.490" style="s2">happened in the early 70s with the oil</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.631" end="02:19:42.070" style="s2">crisis and all that so there were times</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.490" end="02:19:44.440" style="s2">when things were shaky but they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.070" end="02:19:46.751" style="s2">shaky the way they are now they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.440" end="02:19:48.160" style="s2">internal shakiness rather than something</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.751" end="02:19:50.200" style="s2">that was a threat that would seem to be</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.160" end="02:19:55.120" style="s2">imposed from the outside and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.200" end="02:19:57.700" style="s2">different and and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.120" end="02:19:59.320" style="s2">associated with with this intellectual</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.700" end="02:20:00.881" style="s2">war that&#39;s going on with post-modernism</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.320" end="02:20:01.061" style="s2">in the you Marxism and all of that as</p>
<p begin="02:20:00.881" end="02:20:08.081" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.061" end="02:20:11.141" style="s2">so the ether of the program music on the</p>

<p begin="02:20:38.470" end="02:20:43.270" style="s2">questions well I&#39;ll tell you a couple of</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.380" end="02:20:44.770" style="s2">strange things that that things that I</p>
<p begin="02:20:43.270" end="02:20:46.570" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand the first is</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.770" end="02:20:48.100" style="s2">when we&#39;ve done the analysis of the</p>
<p begin="02:20:46.570" end="02:20:50.470" style="s2">effects of the future altering program</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.100" end="02:20:52.840" style="s2">it has had a difference its differential</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.470" end="02:20:55.689" style="s2">impact on men and it had a particularly</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.840" end="02:20:57.750" style="s2">differential impact on what I would call</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.689" end="02:21:01.500" style="s2">excluded men and so that would be</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.750" end="02:21:04.840" style="s2">non-western ethnic minority men or or</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.500" end="02:21:06.930" style="s2">what majority men who are doing very</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.840" end="02:21:09.250" style="s2">well so for example at Mohawk College</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.930" end="02:21:11.710" style="s2">the theater authoring program had a</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.250" end="02:21:13.090" style="s2">particularly robust effect on Mohawk</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.710" end="02:21:14.500" style="s2">College students who were men who</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.090" end="02:21:17.530" style="s2">haven&#39;t done very well in high school</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.500" end="02:21:20.200" style="s2">and who hadn&#39;t picked a major that had a</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.530" end="02:21:22.600" style="s2">destination a career destination at its</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.200" end="02:21:24.430" style="s2">end so you can imagine those people are</p>
<p begin="02:21:22.600" end="02:21:27.250" style="s2">they have an ambiguous relationship with</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.430" end="02:21:29.350" style="s2">the idea of education and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.250" end="02:21:33.399" style="s2">oriented specifically towards a goal</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.350" end="02:21:35.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not very motivated now why does</p>
<p begin="02:21:33.399" end="02:21:38.649" style="s2">it have a differential effect on man</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.200" end="02:21:40.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question well first of all</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.649" end="02:21:42.550" style="s2">the women are doing better so it might</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.840" end="02:21:44.080" style="s2">just be a matter of the fact that it</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.550" end="02:21:45.939" style="s2">does better for people who aren&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.080" end="02:21:48.460" style="s2">as well and at the moment most of them</p>
<p begin="02:21:45.939" end="02:21:50.470" style="s2">are men I don&#39;t believe I think that</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.460" end="02:21:52.930" style="s2">might be part of it but I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.470" end="02:21:54.189" style="s2">that&#39;s all of it I think that part of</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.930" end="02:21:56.649" style="s2">the reason that women are doing better</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.189" end="02:21:58.780" style="s2">is because they&#39;re agreeable and so if a</p>
<p begin="02:21:56.649" end="02:22:01.090" style="s2">system sets out a structure and says</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.780" end="02:22:02.530" style="s2">here&#39;s a pathway to attainment the women</p>
<p begin="02:22:01.090" end="02:22:03.820" style="s2">won&#39;t rebel against that they&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.530" end="02:22:05.649" style="s2">along with it and that&#39;s working very</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.820" end="02:22:07.270" style="s2">well for them at the moment the men</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.649" end="02:22:09.070" style="s2">especially the men on the disagreeable</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.270" end="02:22:11.050" style="s2">end of the distribution and there&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.070" end="02:22:12.550" style="s2">more men on the district disagreeable</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.050" end="02:22:14.860" style="s2">end of the distribution then there are</p>
<p begin="02:22:12.550" end="02:22:16.180" style="s2">women right that&#39;s what you get from if</p>
<p begin="02:22:14.860" end="02:22:18.370" style="s2">you look at overlapping normal</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.180" end="02:22:20.310" style="s2">distributions so there&#39;s the male just</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.370" end="02:22:22.540" style="s2">female distribution for agreeableness</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.310" end="02:22:25.510" style="s2">male distribution for agreeableness</p>
<p begin="02:22:22.540" end="02:22:27.340" style="s2">tremendous overlap okay women are higher</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.510" end="02:22:29.680" style="s2">all the really agreeable people are</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.340" end="02:22:31.840" style="s2">women all the really disagreeable people</p>
<p begin="02:22:29.680" end="02:22:34.720" style="s2">are men and maybe the real differences</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.840" end="02:22:36.850" style="s2">occur at the extremes right so so and</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.720" end="02:22:39.070" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting side effect of</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.850" end="02:22:41.470" style="s2">overlapping distributions so they people</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.070" end="02:22:44.100" style="s2">can be mostly the same but that can</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.470" end="02:22:46.149" style="s2">still produce radical differences</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.100" end="02:22:47.060" style="s2">disagreeable men won&#39;t do anything they</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.149" end="02:22:50.659" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.060" end="02:22:52.520" style="s2">they just say up yours I&#39;ll go home and</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.659" end="02:22:55.100" style="s2">play video games with you no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.520" end="02:22:56.060" style="s2">listening to your stupid classes and why</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.100" end="02:22:59.180" style="s2">should I work for you</p>
<p begin="02:22:56.060" end="02:23:01.159" style="s2">I&#39;ll just go have fun I&#39;ll do my own</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.180" end="02:23:03.260" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t think they&#39;re motivated</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.159" end="02:23:04.970" style="s2">and so then if you take the men who are</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.260" end="02:23:07.669" style="s2">like that and you say okay what do you</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.970" end="02:23:09.319" style="s2">want you can have what you want but you</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.669" end="02:23:10.399" style="s2">have to figure out what it is so then</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.319" end="02:23:12.020" style="s2">they write down what they want they</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.399" end="02:23:13.549" style="s2">think oh hey well that might be worth</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.020" end="02:23:15.409" style="s2">having so maybe I&#39;ll put some effort</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.549" end="02:23:17.869" style="s2">into it that&#39;s what it looks like to me</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.409" end="02:23:20.659" style="s2">now you know that&#39;s weak evidence and</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.869" end="02:23:22.459" style="s2">this is a weak argument but I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="02:23:20.659" end="02:23:23.510" style="s2">to stretch out my understanding to</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.459" end="02:23:24.799" style="s2">account for this but I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.510" end="02:23:28.279" style="s2">something else that&#39;s really weird I</p>
<p begin="02:23:24.799" end="02:23:29.930" style="s2">don&#39;t understand this either so more</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.279" end="02:23:32.209" style="s2">than 90% of the people who watch my</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.930" end="02:23:34.459" style="s2">videos on YouTube are men now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.209" end="02:23:36.799" style="s2">weird because not about 80% of</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.459" end="02:23:38.659" style="s2">psychology students are women so that is</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.799" end="02:23:40.640" style="s2">not what you would expect right you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.659" end="02:23:42.140" style="s2">expect that the majority of them would</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.640" end="02:23:43.399" style="s2">be women and you might say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.140" end="02:23:45.020" style="s2">because of the political stance I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.399" end="02:23:46.909" style="s2">taken and I thought well that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.020" end="02:23:48.979" style="s2">so I went and looked at the demographic</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.909" end="02:23:50.479" style="s2">data because I have that well before I</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.979" end="02:23:52.430" style="s2">did any of the political videos</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.479" end="02:23:54.649" style="s2">eighty-five percent of my viewers were</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.430" end="02:23:57.079" style="s2">men so it&#39;s actually increased a bit</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.649" end="02:23:59.479" style="s2">it&#39;s increased by six percent and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.079" end="02:24:01.939" style="s2">not trivial but it was still</p>
<p begin="02:23:59.479" end="02:24:03.589" style="s2">overwhelmingly men so that was</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.939" end="02:24:04.579" style="s2">interesting I thought what the hell why</p>
<p begin="02:24:03.589" end="02:24:06.739" style="s2">is that exactly</p>
<p begin="02:24:04.579" end="02:24:09.229" style="s2">and then now I&#39;ve been watching crowds</p>
<p begin="02:24:06.739" end="02:24:10.699" style="s2">when I&#39;ve been talking to them and the</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.229" end="02:24:12.560" style="s2">crowds that have come to see me in</p>
<p begin="02:24:10.699" end="02:24:14.539" style="s2">person this happened at the University</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.560" end="02:24:16.430" style="s2">of Toronto free speech debate and I</p>
<p begin="02:24:14.539" end="02:24:18.079" style="s2">actually noticed it and commented on it</p>
<p begin="02:24:16.430" end="02:24:19.579" style="s2">before the debate took place because I</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.079" end="02:24:21.140" style="s2">was talking about intrinsic differences</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.579" end="02:24:22.430" style="s2">between men and women and I looked</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.140" end="02:24:24.560" style="s2">around the room and I thought hmm</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.430" end="02:24:26.779" style="s2">hey 80% of the people in this room are</p>
<p begin="02:24:24.560" end="02:24:28.039" style="s2">men so I had all the men stat women and</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.779" end="02:24:30.049" style="s2">women stand up and then all the men</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.039" end="02:24:32.959" style="s2">stand up it said look like here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.049" end="02:24:34.189" style="s2">natural experiment for some reason 80%</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.959" end="02:24:35.869" style="s2">of the people who showed up to this or</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.189" end="02:24:38.359" style="s2">men now everybody thought I was kind of</p>
<p begin="02:24:35.869" end="02:24:40.939" style="s2">cracked to to do that and it was a risk</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.359" end="02:24:43.069" style="s2">you know and I but I thought no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:40.939" end="02:24:45.260" style="s2">something going on here and then what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:43.069" end="02:24:47.359" style="s2">interesting now is that every public</p>
<p begin="02:24:45.260" end="02:24:48.439" style="s2">appearance that I&#39;ve made that&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.359" end="02:24:51.169" style="s2">to the sort of topics that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.439" end="02:24:54.140" style="s2">discussing is overwhelmingly men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.169" end="02:24:55.669" style="s2">like it&#39;s like 85 to 90 percent and so I</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.140" end="02:24:57.709" style="s2">thought wow that&#39;s weird like what the</p>
<p begin="02:24:55.669" end="02:25:00.250" style="s2">hell&#39;s going on here exactly and then</p>
<p begin="02:24:57.709" end="02:25:01.810" style="s2">the other thing I&#39;ve noticed is that</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.250" end="02:25:03.250" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking a lot to the crowds</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.810" end="02:25:05.200" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been talking to not about</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.250" end="02:25:06.730" style="s2">rights but about responsibility right</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.200" end="02:25:08.320" style="s2">because he can&#39;t have the bloody</p>
<p begin="02:25:06.730" end="02:25:09.790" style="s2">converse what do you do it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.320" end="02:25:11.530" style="s2">have the conversation about rights</p>
<p begin="02:25:09.790" end="02:25:13.930" style="s2">without the conversation about</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.530" end="02:25:16.620" style="s2">responsibility because your rights are</p>
<p begin="02:25:13.930" end="02:25:19.690" style="s2">my responsibility that&#39;s what they are</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.620" end="02:25:21.550" style="s2">technically so you just can&#39;t have only</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.690" end="02:25:23.800" style="s2">half of that discussion and we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.550" end="02:25:25.270" style="s2">having half that discussion the question</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.800" end="02:25:27.820" style="s2">is well what the hell are you leaving</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.270" end="02:25:29.740" style="s2">out if you only have that half of the</p>
<p begin="02:25:27.820" end="02:25:31.510" style="s2">discussion and the answer is while</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.740" end="02:25:33.190" style="s2">you&#39;re leaving out responsibility and</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.510" end="02:25:34.150" style="s2">then the question is well what are you</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.190" end="02:25:36.160" style="s2">leaving out if you&#39;re leaving out</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.150" end="02:25:37.780" style="s2">responsibility and the answer might be</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.160" end="02:25:40.090" style="s2">well maybe you&#39;re leaving out the</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.780" end="02:25:42.450" style="s2">meaning of life that&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.090" end="02:25:45.210" style="s2">like to me it&#39;s like here you are</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.450" end="02:25:48.520" style="s2">suffering away what makes it worthwhile</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.210" end="02:25:51.700" style="s2">right you know you&#39;re completely out</p>
<p begin="02:25:48.520" end="02:25:55.000" style="s2">you&#39;re completely you have no idea what</p>
<p begin="02:25:51.700" end="02:25:59.040" style="s2">you&#39;re you it&#39;s almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="02:25:55.000" end="02:26:02.350" style="s2">describe how bad an idea that is</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.040" end="02:26:02.800" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s what gives life</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.350" end="02:26:06.100" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.800" end="02:26:07.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like lift a load then you can</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.100" end="02:26:11.140" style="s2">tolerate yourself right because look at</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.690" end="02:26:12.660" style="s2">your useless easily hurt easily killed</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.140" end="02:26:15.910" style="s2">why should you have any self-respect</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.660" end="02:26:17.830" style="s2">that&#39;s the story of the fall pick</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.910" end="02:26:19.720" style="s2">something up and carry it pick make it</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.830" end="02:26:22.300" style="s2">heavy enough so that you can think yeah</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.720" end="02:26:24.700" style="s2">well useless as I am at least I could</p>
<p begin="02:26:22.300" end="02:26:26.020" style="s2">move that from there to there well</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.700" end="02:26:28.210" style="s2">what&#39;s really cool about that is that</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.020" end="02:26:31.120" style="s2">when I talk to these crowds about this</p>
<p begin="02:26:28.210" end="02:26:32.500" style="s2">the man&#39;s eyes light up and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:26:31.120" end="02:26:33.430" style="s2">like I&#39;ve seen that phenomena because</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.500" end="02:26:34.870" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about this</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.430" end="02:26:36.340" style="s2">mythological material for a long time</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.870" end="02:26:38.890" style="s2">and I can see when I&#39;m watching crowds</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.340" end="02:26:41.050" style="s2">people you know their eyebrows lifter I</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.890" end="02:26:42.670" style="s2">let light up because I put something</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.050" end="02:26:44.170" style="s2">together for them that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:26:42.670" end="02:26:45.970" style="s2">mythological stories do so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.170" end="02:26:48.040" style="s2">taking responsibility for that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:45.970" end="02:26:49.990" style="s2">what the stories do so I save the story</p>
<p begin="02:26:48.040" end="02:26:50.860" style="s2">people go click click click you know in</p>
<p begin="02:26:49.990" end="02:26:52.720" style="s2">their eyes light up</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.860" end="02:26:54.490" style="s2">but this responsibility thing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.720" end="02:26:56.470" style="s2">whole new order of this is that young</p>
<p begin="02:26:54.490" end="02:26:58.840" style="s2">men are so hungry for that it is</p>
<p begin="02:26:56.470" end="02:27:00.250" style="s2">unbelievable and one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.840" end="02:27:02.890" style="s2">been talking to some of the people</p>
<p begin="02:27:00.250" end="02:27:05.170" style="s2">who&#39;ve been running for the conservative</p>

<p begin="02:27:08.050" end="02:27:11.050" style="s2">with young people because conservatives</p>

<p begin="02:27:11.050" end="02:27:13.870" style="s2">young people right because being</p>
<p begin="02:27:12.430" end="02:27:15.370" style="s2">conservative is something that happened</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.870" end="02:27:18.400" style="s2">when you&#39;re older they can sell</p>
<p begin="02:27:15.370" end="02:27:20.710" style="s2">responsibility no one&#39;s selling it and</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.400" end="02:27:23.410" style="s2">the thing is for men there&#39;s nothing but</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.710" end="02:27:25.090" style="s2">responsibility you know I was watching</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.410" end="02:27:26.830" style="s2">The Simpsons the other day I watched the</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.090" end="02:27:29.260" style="s2">first Simpsons episode and I</p>
<p begin="02:27:26.830" end="02:27:30.790" style="s2">deconstructed it and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.260" end="02:27:32.980" style="s2">interesting so what happens in the first</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.790" end="02:27:35.021" style="s2">Simpson episode is that it&#39;s Christmas</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.980" end="02:27:36.670" style="s2">and Homer and Marge are going to buy</p>
<p begin="02:27:35.021" end="02:27:38.800" style="s2">some Christmas presents but Homer</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.670" end="02:27:41.771" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get his Christmas bonus and so</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.800" end="02:27:43.240" style="s2">he&#39;s absolutely crushed by that and that</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.771" end="02:27:45.670" style="s2">actually is a recurring theme in The</p>
<p begin="02:27:43.240" end="02:27:46.870" style="s2">Simpsons where Homer loses his job or</p>
<p begin="02:27:45.670" end="02:27:48.700" style="s2">something like that or can tonight make</p>
<p begin="02:27:46.870" end="02:27:49.900" style="s2">enough money he&#39;s completely crushed</p>
<p begin="02:27:48.700" end="02:27:53.530" style="s2">even though he&#39;s kind of useless</p>
<p begin="02:27:49.900" end="02:27:55.720" style="s2">bumbling laughing fool of a guy you know</p>
<p begin="02:27:53.530" end="02:27:57.430" style="s2">the thing that gives that show its soul</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.720" end="02:27:58.990" style="s2">is that he&#39;s still oriented towards his</p>
<p begin="02:27:57.430" end="02:28:02.440" style="s2">family that&#39;s what makes him honorable</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.990" end="02:28:04.390" style="s2">is that foolish as he is he&#39;s decided to</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.440" end="02:28:06.940" style="s2">adopt responsibility for his family and</p>
<p begin="02:28:04.390" end="02:28:08.860" style="s2">to try to bear that and so he&#39;s not he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.940" end="02:28:10.840" style="s2">a holy fool he&#39;s not a complete fool and</p>
<p begin="02:28:08.860" end="02:28:12.670" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting watching the story</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.840" end="02:28:14.561" style="s2">because he suffers dreadfully as a</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.670" end="02:28:16.890" style="s2">consequence of not being able to fulfill</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.561" end="02:28:18.970" style="s2">his responsibilities well that&#39;s for men</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.890" end="02:28:21.120" style="s2">women have their sets of</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.970" end="02:28:23.771" style="s2">responsibilities they&#39;re not the same</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.120" end="02:28:25.180" style="s2">right because they&#39;re complicated</p>
<p begin="02:28:23.771" end="02:28:27.670" style="s2">because women of course have to take</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.180" end="02:28:29.590" style="s2">primary responsibility for for having</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.670" end="02:28:31.660" style="s2">infants at least but then also for</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.590" end="02:28:34.660" style="s2">caring for them there they&#39;re structured</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.660" end="02:28:35.950" style="s2">differently than men for biological</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.660" end="02:28:37.811" style="s2">necessity even if it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.950" end="02:28:40.300" style="s2">psychological issue and it&#39;s also partly</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.811" end="02:28:42.910" style="s2">a psychological issue women know what</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.300" end="02:28:44.740" style="s2">they have to do men have to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.910" end="02:28:46.990" style="s2">what they have to do and if they have</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.740" end="02:28:50.220" style="s2">nothing worth living for then they stay</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.990" end="02:28:53.880" style="s2">Peter Pan and why the hell not</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.220" end="02:28:59.050" style="s2">because the alternative to valued</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.880" end="02:29:01.630" style="s2">responsibility is impulsive low-class</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.050" end="02:29:03.070" style="s2">pleasure and you saw that in the</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.630" end="02:29:05.650" style="s2">Pinocchio story right that&#39;s Pleasure</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.070" end="02:29:08.021" style="s2">Island it&#39;s like well why lift the load</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.650" end="02:29:09.280" style="s2">if there&#39;s nothing in it for you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:08.021" end="02:29:11.890" style="s2">another thing that we&#39;re doing to men</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.280" end="02:29:14.561" style="s2">that&#39;s a very bad idea and to boys it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:11.890" end="02:29:16.300" style="s2">like you&#39;re pathological and oppressive</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.561" end="02:29:18.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like fine then why the hell am I</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.300" end="02:29:20.440" style="s2">going to play that&#39;s if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.130" end="02:29:22.450" style="s2">situation if I get no credit for bearing</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.440" end="02:29:24.220" style="s2">responsibility it could bloody well be</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.450" end="02:29:25.811" style="s2">sure I&#39;m not going to barity but then</p>
<p begin="02:29:24.220" end="02:29:27.660" style="s2">you know your life is useless and</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.811" end="02:29:29.670" style="s2">meaningless and you have you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:29:27.660" end="02:29:31.350" style="s2">full of self-contempt and nihilism and</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.670" end="02:29:33.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.350" end="02:29:35.700" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why I think that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.810" end="02:29:37.800" style="s2">think&#39;s going on at a deeper level with</p>
<p begin="02:29:35.700" end="02:29:40.050" style="s2">regards to men needing this direction</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.800" end="02:29:43.140" style="s2">a man has to decide that he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:29:40.050" end="02:29:46.500" style="s2">do something he has to decide that and</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.140" end="02:29:49.010" style="s2">the different sort of animal things were</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.500" end="02:29:49.010" style="s2">some more</p>

<p begin="02:30:13.529" end="02:30:19.619" style="s2">community it should cover the the domain</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.859" end="02:30:22.109" style="s2">of life I mean there&#39;s constraints on</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.619" end="02:30:23.909" style="s2">what you should regard as a value but</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.109" end="02:30:28.770" style="s2">you but within those constraints you</p>

<p begin="02:30:28.770" end="02:30:31.949" style="s2">thing is is that people will carry a</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.479" end="02:30:35.399" style="s2">heavy load if they get to pick the</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.949" end="02:30:37.260" style="s2">goddamn load so and they think well I</p>

<p begin="02:30:53.609" end="02:30:56.850" style="s2">for low conscientious people I mean</p>
<p begin="02:30:55.500" end="02:30:58.170" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re open and creative or</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.850" end="02:31:02.100" style="s2">extroverted and some other things but</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.170" end="02:31:04.409" style="s2">for the for the typical person they</p>

<p begin="02:31:04.409" end="02:31:07.350" style="s2">themselves up unless they have a load</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.000" end="02:31:09.810" style="s2">this is why there&#39;s such an opiate</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.350" end="02:31:11.699" style="s2">epidemic among dispossessed white</p>
<p begin="02:31:09.810" end="02:31:13.739" style="s2">middle-aged guys who are unemployed in</p>
