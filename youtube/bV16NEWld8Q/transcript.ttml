<p begin="00:00:09.860" end="00:00:15.460" style="s2">so I hope we can... my plan is to finish this today</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.460" end="00:00:23.660" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll go into the more concrete details now that you&#39;ve got some sense of the way that a narrative like this can unfold</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.660" end="00:00:31.540" style="s2">if you remember, we were just leaving this terrible little bar, which I think was called the Red Lobster</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.540" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">something like that; where the fox and the cat had met the coachman</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:42.460" style="s2">and the Coachman is obviously someone who takes you somewhere, he takes you on a trip</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.460" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">and the coachman basically revealed himself, first he kinda looks like a, I guess a somewhat jolly old man</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:53.100" style="s2">although his expression doesn&#39;t precisely read as jolly</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">and then he reveals himself as something positively satanic</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:02.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s enough to terrify these two-bit thugs, the Fox and the Cat</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.880" end="00:01:06.300" style="s2">who think they&#39;re tough, but really aren&#39;t tough at all</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.300" end="00:01:10.640" style="s2">and so they see at some point what they&#39;re really tangled up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.640" end="00:01:18.160" style="s2">and I think I mentioned to you that that was something akin... Jung had this idea that people&#39;s shadows reach all the way down to hell</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.160" end="00:01:22.580" style="s2">which is actually a very frightening concept, and what he meant by that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.580" end="00:01:29.300" style="s2">if you take a look at the impulses that drive you that are actually malevolent, if you can admit to such impulses</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.300" end="00:01:36.700" style="s2">that if you basically follow those all the way down to their origin, you can find some very nasty things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.700" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">and what you find down there basically is what allies you with people who&#39;ve done terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a very pleasant experience, I would say</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">although one thing that&#39;s worth thinking about is that it is something that can protect you against being very very badly hurt</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:03.420" style="s2">because one of the things that characterizes people who develop post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.420" end="00:02:09.640" style="s2">is that they&#39;re often naive, and then they encounter something that&#39;s really not within their framework of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.640" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s usually something bad, and because there isn&#39;t anything in their philosophy, their way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">that has prepared them for that, they end up fragmented and devastated</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">it&#39;s actually protective to you if you can figure out what your full range of capabilities is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:36.920" style="s2">because that can help you understand other people a lot better, and to be wiser and more careful in your actions</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.920" end="00:02:42.120" style="s2">it&#39;s also useful, I think, if you want to convince yourself to act properly</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.120" end="00:02:51.140" style="s2">because if you regard yourself as harmless, which is a big mistake, then nothing you can do is really that bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.140" end="00:02:56.200" style="s2">right? because you&#39;re harmless, after all; but if you understand that you&#39;re seriously not harmless</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.200" end="00:03:00.380" style="s2">then that can make you a lot more careful with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.380" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">and I would say that&#39;s especially true maybe when you&#39;re dealing... when you have kids, and you start dealing with your kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:10.160" style="s2">if you know that... what you&#39;re capable of, because you&#39;re human</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.160" end="00:03:15.600" style="s2">then that can motivate you to be much more careful with what you say and do</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.600" end="00:03:20.060" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean cautious, I don&#39;t mean timid, I don&#39;t mean any of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.060" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">I just mean that you wanna keep things pristine between you and your children, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:29.060" style="s2">because that way they&#39;re on your good side, and you want them on your good side</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.060" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">because children who get on their parents&#39; bad side suffer very badly for it, and sometimes it&#39;s because they&#39;re literally abused</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:44.200" style="s2">but more often it&#39;s because they get, well they get abused, let&#39;s say, or neglected, in  much more subtle ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.200" end="00:03:50.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re definitely capable of that, I mean, all you have to do is think about the way you&#39;ve interacted</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.520" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">with someone that you&#39;ve decided to not like, or maybe someone you genuinely don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">and that can range from just not paying any attention to them, especially if they&#39;re doing something good</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:05.340" style="s2">to really pursuing them, and making their life miserable, and you can certainly do that with your family members</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.340" end="00:04:10.160" style="s2">and you can do that with your intimate partners, and you can do that with your friends, and you can do it with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.160" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s really worth knowing that, so... well...</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:23.220" style="s2">the Fox thinks he&#39;s a royal rule breaker, but he&#39;s really just a two-bit thug, and this is where he learns that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.220" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">so... sorry, I have a new phone, and I&#39;m kind of stupid with it, still</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:35.200" style="s2">so...</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.200" end="00:04:40.100" style="s2">well, hypothetically that would work, probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.100" end="00:04:45.940" style="s2">anyways, the Coachman&#39;s got these guys in his grasp now, regardless</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.940" end="00:04:52.680" style="s2">partly because they&#39;re already down this road, and they can&#39;t back off, and partly &#39;cause he also offers them more money than they&#39;ve seen before</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.680" end="00:04:59.180" style="s2">so as bad as they are, they&#39;re going to get worse... many of you, I presume, have seen Breaking Bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.180" end="00:05:08.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good example of the incorporation, at least in part, or maybe the possession by the shadow from a Jungian perspective</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.180" end="00:05:14.440" style="s2">right, because you have this ordinary high school teacher who really thinks that he&#39;s an axe [?] and his family as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.440" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">you know, like your typical persona, roughly speaking, he&#39;s just a normal guy</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:24.940" style="s2">but part of the reason that he&#39;s a normal guy is &#39;cause he actually hasn&#39;t been put in abnormal circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.940" end="00:05:29.760" style="s2">and then all of a sudden he is, and he has a genuine moral conundrum, right, he&#39;s gonna die of lung cancer</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.760" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">and he has a son who&#39;s got a lot of health problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:39.140" style="s2">and he&#39;s terrified that he&#39;s going to leave his wife and his child behind with nothing</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.140" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">and then of course as the story... and so he decides to do something that... temporarily... that he regards as... that he would normally regard as reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.800" end="00:05:54.260" style="s2">and of course he just gets tangled up in that, but then, as the story unfolds, you see that there&#39;s... it&#39;s more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.260" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s not that he was just innocent good guy, and he decided to turn bad, he&#39;s also very resentful</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:05.560" style="s2">and angry, and it&#39;s partly because he&#39;s a bit of a pushover at the beginning, or maybe more than a bit of a pushover</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.560" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">and also that he didn&#39;t really fulfill his own potential, and that, you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:18.220" style="s2">he had friends who walked down the entrepreneurial path and maybe they weren&#39;t quite fair to him, but whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.220" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">he ends up not very successful as a high school teacher, so he&#39;s really angry about that, and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:29.880" style="s2">there&#39;s more motivation for him opening up the door to the terrible elements of his personality</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.880" end="00:06:33.880" style="s2">than just the fact that he&#39;s got good motivations to do so</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.880" end="00:06:39.760" style="s2">and that unfolds, so you see the warps and twists in his resentful character</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.760" end="00:06:47.720" style="s2">increasingly manifest themselves as he walks down this road to, really, total brutality, and it&#39;s quite good</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.720" end="00:06:51.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a book called &quot;Ordinary Men&quot; that&#39;s a lot like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.900" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve mentioned that to you before, but &quot;Ordinary Men&quot; is a book about... it&#39;s the best book of its type</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:03.740" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the only book of its type... it&#39;s possible, but it&#39;s plotted much like Breaking Bad in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.740" end="00:07:09.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a story about these German policemen in the early stages of World War II</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.620" end="00:07:17.900" style="s2">and they were guys who were old enough to be raised in Germany really before the Hitlerian propaganda came out in full force</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.900" end="00:07:22.200" style="s2">if you were a teenager, say, in the 1930s, you were gonna be pulled right into the propaganda machine</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.200" end="00:07:25.920" style="s2">and maybe you were part of the Hitler Youth, like you were raised in that, you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.920" end="00:07:28.920" style="s2">but if you were older, then you were raised before that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.920" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re not as amenable to propaganda once you&#39;re older than about, well, I would say, about 22 or  something like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.880" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty young, actually; if you&#39;re gonna make a soldier, you have to get a soldier young</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:46.300" style="s2">&#39;cause once people are in their early twenties, say, they already have their personality developed</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.300" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">anyways, these policemen were sent into Poland after the Germans marched through</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:58.520" style="s2">and, you know, it was wartime, and there was this hypothesis in Germany that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">the Jews in particular were operating as a fifth column in undermining the German war effort</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:10.540" style="s2">because of course the Germans blamed the Jews and a variety of other people for actually  setting up the conditions that made the war necessary</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.540" end="00:08:17.140" style="s2">and the police were sent into Poland, they were also required to make peace, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.140" end="00:08:23.200" style="s2">they started out by rounding up all the Jewish men between 18 and 65</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.200" end="00:08:28.820" style="s2">and gathering them in stadiums, and then shipping them off on trains, but that isn&#39;t where they ended</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.820" end="00:08:35.300" style="s2">they ended in a very, very dark place, I mean these guys were going out in the field with naked pregnant women</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.300" end="00:08:38.680" style="s2">and shooting them in the back of the head by the end of their training</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.680" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">and what&#39;s really interesting about that is that their commander told them that they could go home at any time</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:50.520" style="s2">so this is not one of those examples of people following orders</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.520" end="00:08:55.860" style="s2">and the reason they didn&#39;t, roughly speaking, there&#39;s many reasons, but one of the reasons they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.860" end="00:09:02.060" style="s2">is because they didn&#39;t think it was comradely, so to speak, to leave the guys they were working with</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.060" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">to do all the dirty work and run off; and that&#39;s a really interesting fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:12.340" style="s2">because in different circumstances you wouldn&#39;t think about that as reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.340" end="00:09:19.300" style="s2">you&#39;d think: well, that&#39;s part of team work under rough circumstances; and that&#39;s at least in part how they viewed it</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.300" end="00:09:25.300" style="s2">they were also made physically ill multiple times, physically and psychologically ill, by the thing that they had to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.300" end="00:09:29.900" style="s2">but they kept doing them anyways, so one step at a time</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:35.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing, is that you end up in very bad place one step at a time, so you better watch those steps</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.640" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">anyways, Pinokio has now decided, after his latest misadventure, to return to the proper pathway</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.740" end="00:09:52.420" style="s2">he&#39;s off to school again, and he&#39;s still pretty naive, although perhaps not as much so as he was before</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.420" end="00:09:56.740" style="s2">so he decided that he&#39;s gonna do things right, he&#39;s gonna go get educated, he&#39;s going back to school</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.740" end="00:10:01.480" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna take the conventional route to discipline, and be a good boy, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.480" end="00:10:06.520" style="s2">and so, he&#39;s off to school, and the fox waylays him again</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.520" end="00:10:12.780" style="s2">this is a really interesting scene, took me quite a long time to unpack this too</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.780" end="00:10:20.260" style="s2">and so, the fox, first of all, starts out by acting like he&#39;s sympathetic again, sympathetic towards Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.260" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">and so, he&#39;s empathetic, you could say, and... so this is an interesting analysis of empathy</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:33.420" style="s2">so what happens is the fox convinces Pinokio through a variety of maneuvers</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.420" end="00:10:38.360" style="s2">that he&#39;s actually not feeling very well, that he&#39;s sick, he really convinces him that he&#39;s a victim</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.360" end="00:10:47.320" style="s2">and one of the things... I had a graduate student named Maya Maja Djikic, who had worked with the UN in  Bosnia</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.320" end="00:10:52.340" style="s2">and she had toured some of the mass grave sites there, and we wrote a paper one time, called:</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.340" end="00:10:56.520" style="s2">&quot;You can neither remember nor forget what you don&#39;t understand&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.520" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">and it was a paper about the idea, for example, it was partly about the idea that we should never forget the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:07.520" style="s2">and that the idea there is that, well, we should never forget it and we should never repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.520" end="00:11:12.280" style="s2">but the thing is, if you don&#39;t understand how those things come about, you can&#39;t really remember them, right?</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.280" end="00:11:19.140" style="s2">you think about them as a set of historical facts, but that&#39;s not the kind of remembering that actually makes any difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.140" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">you have to understand the causal pathways, you have to understand how a society would transform in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:30.200" style="s2">and more importantly, you have to understand the role of the individuals within that society</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.200" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">unless you&#39;re going to assume that they&#39;re so completely unlike you that there&#39;s no connection whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:39.780" style="s2">in which case you haven&#39;t remembered it at all, you haven&#39;t learned anything at all</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.780" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">because the right lesson from what happened in the 20th century is: this is what human beings are like</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:50.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the correct lesson, and you can say: well, not me; but...</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.580" end="00:11:57.840" style="s2">but probably you too, that&#39;s the thing, probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.840" end="00:12:02.080" style="s2">and probably me too, and least under normal circumstances; anyways...</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.080" end="00:12:10.580" style="s2">the Fox convinces Pinocchio that he&#39;s sick, he performs a lot of tricks to do this</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.580" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">now, you could say that Pinocchio is susceptible to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">because maybe there&#39;s still a part of him that&#39;s looking for the easy way out, and so...</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.980" end="00:12:23.880" style="s2">one of the things that Maja and I found when we were writing this paper</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.880" end="00:12:28.040" style="s2">we were looking at the discourse that precedes genocide and genocidal states</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.040" end="00:12:32.760" style="s2">and the enhancement of a sense of victimization on the part of one of the groups</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.760" end="00:12:35.320" style="s2">usually the group that&#39;s going to commit the genocide</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.320" end="00:12:41.260" style="s2">first of all, their sense of being victims is much heightened by the demagogues</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.260" end="00:12:46.500" style="s2">who are trying to stir up this sort of hatred, so they basically say: look, you&#39;ve been oppressed in a variety of ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.500" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">and these are the people who did it, and they&#39;re not gonna stop doing it, and this time we&#39;re gonna get them before they get us</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:58.220" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that; and so there&#39;s something very pathological about the enhancement of victimization</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.220" end="00:13:12.200" style="s2">which is, well... see the problem as far as I&#39;m concerned with it is, it&#39;s not thought through very well</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.200" end="00:13:20.440" style="s2">because there&#39;s a point that&#39;s being made, and the point is that people have been oppressed and they suffer</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.440" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s true, that point; but then the proper framework from within which to interpret that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:38.740" style="s2">I believe is that that&#39;s characteristic of life, you can&#39;t take it personally in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.740" end="00:13:42.640" style="s2">and you can&#39;t divide the world neatly into perpetrators and victims</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.640" end="00:13:48.220" style="s2">and you certainly can&#39;t divide the whole world neatly into perpetrators and victims and then assume that you&#39;re only in the victim class</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.220" end="00:13:55.180" style="s2">and then assume that that gives you certain... like access to certain... forms of redress, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.180" end="00:13:59.220" style="s2">it gets dangerous very rapidly if you do that sort of thing, so... For example,</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.220" end="00:14:04.940" style="s2">one of the things that characterized the Soviet Union - and this was particularly true in the 1920&#39;s - but also afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.940" end="00:14:12.980" style="s2">the Soviets were very much enamored of the idea of class guilt.</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.980" end="00:14:22.460" style="s2">So, for example, although it was only about 40 years previously that the serfs had been emancipated, they weren&#39;t much more than slaves, right?</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:27.320" style="s2">So that was the bulk of the Russian population. They were bought and sold along with the land.</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.320" end="00:14:35.200" style="s2">So, they had been emancipated and some of them - many of them - had turned into independent farmers</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.200" end="00:14:39.840" style="s2">and some of them had become reasonably prosperous, because, at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.840" end="00:14:47.020" style="s2">well, I presume a certain proportion of them from being crooked, but I presume a larger proportion from actually being able to raise food</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.020" end="00:14:52.400" style="s2">and of course, at that time the bulk of the Russian food population [sic] was produced by</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.400" end="00:14:58.860" style="s2">these relatively successful peasant farmers; and relatively successful would mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.860" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">maybe they had a brick house or something, and maybe they had a couple of cows, and maybe they were able to hire a few people</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:08.460" style="s2">so you know, it wasn&#39;t like they were massive land owners or anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.460" end="00:15:14.700" style="s2">but I talked to you a little bit about the Pareto principle and the notion that in any domain of activity</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.700" end="00:15:19.200" style="s2">a small proportion of people end up producing most of what&#39;s in that domain of activity</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.200" end="00:15:25.880" style="s2">the same was true in Russia with regards to these peasant farmers, some of them were extraordinarily efficient</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.880" end="00:15:29.020" style="s2">and they produced most of Russia&#39;s food</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.020" end="00:15:35.900" style="s2">when the communists came in, they described those land holders as parasites, essentially</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.900" end="00:15:42.460" style="s2">predicated on the Marxist idea that if someone had extracted profit from an enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.460" end="00:15:49.620" style="s2">that the had basically stolen that profit from the people, say, that they had employed or otherwise oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.620" end="00:15:57.340" style="s2">so you could be a member of the kulak [spells it out] class</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.340" end="00:16:01.620" style="s2">and then because you were a member of that class, you were automatically guilty</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.620" end="00:16:05.660" style="s2">so what happened was... and you gotta think this through to really understand what happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.660" end="00:16:12.340" style="s2">so what happened was the intellectual communists were sent out in cadres out into these little towns</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.340" end="00:16:18.300" style="s2">to find people who would help them round up the kulaks; now you gotta think about what a small town is like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.300" end="00:16:23.980" style="s2">because... so imagine you&#39;re in a town, and there&#39;s three or four people, or maybe ten people or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.980" end="00:16:29.280" style="s2">who are a little more successful than everyone else, and a certain number of people are gonna be fine with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.280" end="00:16:33.000" style="s2">any maybe eve happy about it, because they regard those people as particularly productive</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.000" end="00:16:36.900" style="s2">and, you know, as stalwart members of the community, regardless of their flaws</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.900" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s gonna be some people who are not happy about it at all, that are gonna be very resentful about that and jealous</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">and so those are gonna be people whose characters, I would say, are of the less positive type</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:55.840" style="s2">and so when the intellectuals came in and described the reason that these people should be treated as parasites and profiteers</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.840" end="00:17:01.200" style="s2">then it was the resentful minority in those towns, and that would be the kind of guy that hangs around in the bar all the time</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.200" end="00:17:06.440" style="s2">and is completely unconscientious, and fails at everything, and then blames everyone else for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.440" end="00:17:11.440" style="s2">the intellectuals came in and said: this is unfair that this happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.440" end="00:17:17.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually been victimized and now it&#39;s your opportunity to go have your revenge; and that&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.680" end="00:17:26.540" style="s2">now, in some of the villages sometimes the peasants would actually surround the farmsteads of these more successful people</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.540" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">and try to defend them, but that never worked out for very long</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:37.160" style="s2">so then these mobs, these angry mobs, would go into the farmhouses and strip the place right down to nothing</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.160" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">and they packed these people up and sent them on trains with no food, out to Siberia where there was no place to live</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:48.820" style="s2">so they were packed into houses, maybe they had a square meter each to live in</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.820" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">and their children died of typhoid and many of them froze to death</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:17:58.040" style="s2">many, many people died, millions of people died as a consequence of the dekulakization</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.040" end="00:18:02.620" style="s2">at least in... as a consequence of its total effect</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.620" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">so what happened then was that there wasn&#39;t any food produced</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">and so then six million Ukrainians starved to death in the 1920s, it&#39;s something you never hear about, right?</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">you never hear about that, why do you never hear about that? that&#39;s a question worth asking</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">you know, it was an absolute catastrophe, they used to...</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:29.260" style="s2">so these people were starving, right to the point of cannibalism, right, I mean it was ugly</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.260" end="00:18:31.740" style="s2">it was ugly as anything you could possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.740" end="00:18:36.600" style="s2">if you were a mother and... so you&#39;re supposed to hand all your grain in to the central committee</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.600" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">most of it for distribution into the cities, you didn&#39;t get to keep any food yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:46.760" style="s2">and so maybe then afterwards, if you were a mother, you&#39;d go out in the fields that had already been harvested</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.760" end="00:18:52.860" style="s2">and you&#39;d pick up individual grains of wheat, and if you didn&#39;t turn those in, they&#39;d sh... that was death for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.860" end="00:19:00.140" style="s2">so that&#39;s how far it was pushed, so... well, so that&#39;s a little story about</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.140" end="00:19:07.260" style="s2">how the idea of victimization and perpetration can get out of hand extraordinarily rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.260" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">so whenever people are beating the victim drum, you know, they&#39;ll cover that up with empathy, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:23.340" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking on behalf of the oppressed; it&#39;s like, maybe you are, but maybe you&#39;re no saint</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.340" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">because, you know, you&#39;re so sure that you&#39;re a saint and you&#39;re only speaking from the position of good</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:31.695" style="s2">highly unlikely; anyways, so Pinocchio is enticed into believing that he&#39;s a victim</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:40.700" style="s2">now, the logical part of that is that it is the case that, you know, you can make a very strong case that</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.700" end="00:19:46.500" style="s2">every human being is in some sense involved in a tragic enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.500" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">right? because you&#39;re biologically vulnerable, you&#39;re not what you could be as a biological specimen, right?</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:19:56.500" style="s2">you&#39;re full of imperfections and plus, you&#39;re going to be sick, and those you love are going to be  sick</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.500" end="00:20:00.980" style="s2">and everything ends up in death, and so there&#39;s a very tragic element to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.980" end="00:20:07.480" style="s2">and then, by the same token, you&#39;re also subject to the tyrannical aspect of your culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.480" end="00:20:12.500" style="s2">right, &#39;cause it&#39;s forcing you to be a certain way all the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.500" end="00:20:22.540" style="s2">socialization does that, you&#39;re required to modify your own intrinsic nature in order to come into conformity with the broader community</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.540" end="00:20:28.580" style="s2">and you can think about that from the Piagetian sense, which is that socialization makes you a more and more sophisticated person</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.580" end="00:20:34.020" style="s2">and there&#39;s some truth in that, but you can also be subject just to tyranny, you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.020" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">I see people in my practice, for example, they&#39;ve had very tyrannical fathers, for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:45.180" style="s2">sometimes they have tyrannical mothers as well, but they not so much encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.180" end="00:20:49.980" style="s2">to integrate properly into the social community, as they are harassed and abused</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.060" end="00:20:54.600" style="s2">or made to feel insufficient and, you know, basically subject to tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.600" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">and so it&#39;s quite... and that&#39;s true of everyone to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:05.660" style="s2">you know, you come to university and there&#39;s a tyrannical aspect to it; especially in a big institution like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.660" end="00:21:10.620" style="s2">you&#39;re not really marked out as an individual in any sense, you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.620" end="00:21:17.080" style="s2">you&#39;re a number along with 60 thousand other people, and you know, there&#39;s something cold and impersonal about that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.080" end="00:21:20.980" style="s2">which is well represented in the design of this classroom, say</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.980" end="00:21:25.800" style="s2">but by the same token, you know, the university provides you with an identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.800" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">while you&#39;re exploring an intellectual landscape, you know, you have a lot of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:38.040" style="s2">compared to the vast majority of people, perhaps you don&#39;t have as much freedom as you might</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.040" end="00:21:45.400" style="s2">if you compared it to some utopian notion of freedom, but in any real world sense, you&#39;re unbelievably well protected  by the university</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.400" end="00:21:51.940" style="s2">partly because it stamps you with the identity &quot;student&quot;, which is a respectable identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.940" end="00:21:55.380" style="s2">and so you can go off and educate yourself as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.380" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">and everyone in society says that&#39;s okay, they carve out the protected space for you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">so at the same time as you&#39;re being tyrannized by the institution</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:10.420" style="s2">and forced in some ways also to adopt the viewpoints, say, of the professors, depending on the professor</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.420" end="00:22:16.600" style="s2">you&#39;re also the beneficiary of that, just like you&#39;re the beneficiary of this huge industrial infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.600" end="00:22:23.940" style="s2">that underlies everything that you do; so anyways, the  fact that your life is tragic necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.940" end="00:22:29.480" style="s2">and that you are subject to oppression makes the victimization story really easy to swallow</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.480" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">but then there&#39;s a dark side of that, too; and this is actually what happens with Pinokio</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:39.500" style="s2">so, what happens here is that he&#39;s told that he&#39;s ill</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.500" end="00:22:42.940" style="s2">and convinced that he&#39;s ill, and they do use trickery, and...</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.940" end="00:22:47.300" style="s2">so again you could look at him in some sense as an innocent victim, but</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.300" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">the innocence... the filmmakers do a good job of hedging against the innocent interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:23:02.560" style="s2">because what he&#39;s offered and accepts because he&#39;s ill is an easy way out</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.560" end="00:23:07.380" style="s2">and so what the fox basically tells him is that he needs to have the vacation, because he&#39;s sick</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.380" end="00:23:11.860" style="s2">and he can go off to Pleasure Island, which is this place of impulsivity, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.860" end="00:23:15.580" style="s2">and whim, it&#39;s like reversion to being two years old in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.580" end="00:23:21.000" style="s2">and that he really needs that, because otherwise he&#39;s not going to be able to live properly</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:26.540" style="s2">he&#39;s not going to be able to recover his health; and so what Pinokio is offered...</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.540" end="00:23:34.820" style="s2">is the opportunity to abandon your responsibility as a reward for adopting the guise of victim</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.820" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s really worth thinking about, because one of the things I thought about for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">is that... I&#39;ve been trying to figure out what gives people&#39;s lives meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.160" end="00:23:48.860" style="s2">and tragedy gives life its negative meaning, and nobody disputes that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.860" end="00:23:53.660" style="s2">even if you&#39;re nihilistic, you&#39;re not going to dispute the fact that tragedy gives life negative meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.660" end="00:23:57.380" style="s2">so when nihilists say that life is meaningless, that isn&#39;t exactly what they mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.380" end="00:24:03.220" style="s2">they mean that life is suffering, but there isn&#39;t anything transcendent about it that you could set against that suffering</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.220" end="00:24:08.580" style="s2">that&#39;s nihilism, it&#39;s not that life is meaningless, that would just be neutral</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.580" end="00:24:15.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like... no one believes that, they certainly don&#39;t act like they believe it</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.060" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">if you look at it technically, and we will as we progress through this class</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:25.340" style="s2">in order to have any positive meaning in your life you have to have identified a goal</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.340" end="00:24:29.140" style="s2">and you have to be working towards it, and there is a technical reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.140" end="00:24:35.940" style="s2">and the technical reason, as far as I can tell is that the circuitry that produces the kind of positive emotion that people really like</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.940" end="00:24:44.600" style="s2">is only activated when you notice that... when you&#39;re proceeding towards a goal that you value</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.600" end="00:24:48.860" style="s2">and so that means that if you don&#39;t have a goal that you value, you can&#39;t have any positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.860" end="00:24:54.260" style="s2">so technically that&#39;s the incentive reward system, and it&#39;s... the underlying circuitry is dopaminergic</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.260" end="00:25:03.280" style="s2">and when that circuitry is activated then it&#39;s part of the exploratory circuit, it gives you the sense of being actively engaged in something worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.280" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s, you know, you tend to think of positive emotion as something produced by reward</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:13.560" style="s2">but there&#39;s two kinds of positive emotion, one is the reward that&#39;s associated with satiation</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.560" end="00:25:18.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s consummatory reward, and that&#39;s the reward you get when you&#39;re hungry and you eat</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.020" end="00:25:24.380" style="s2">but the thing about eating when you&#39;re hungry is that it destroys the framework within which you were operating</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.380" end="00:25:31.460" style="s2">it&#39;s time to eat, well, you eat, and that framework&#39;s no longer relevant, so the consummatory reward eliminates the value framework</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.460" end="00:25:34.260" style="s2">and then you&#39;re stuck with: well, what are you gonna do next?</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.260" end="00:25:41.220" style="s2">and so, the consummatory reward has with it its own problems, but the incentive reward is constantly what keeps you moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.220" end="00:25:45.860" style="s2">and incentive reward, because it&#39;s dopaminergic, also is analgesic</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.860" end="00:25:51.500" style="s2">literally analgesic; so if you are in pain, you take opiates, and that will cut the pain</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.500" end="00:25:55.880" style="s2">but so will psychomotor stimulants, like cocaine or amphetamines</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.880" end="00:26:01.560" style="s2">and so, it&#39;s literally the case that if you&#39;re engaged in something that&#39;s engaging, you&#39;re working towards a goal</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.560" end="00:26:06.980" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to feel less pain; and you can see this happening with athletes, you know, they&#39;ll break their thumb or something</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.980" end="00:26:12.060" style="s2">or maybe sometimes even their ankle, and they&#39;ll keep playing the game, &#39;course afterwards they&#39;re suffering like mad</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.060" end="00:26:20.100" style="s2">but the fact that they&#39;re so filled with goal-directed enthusiasm means that, well, the pain systems are in some sense shut off</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.100" end="00:26:24.500" style="s2">so that&#39;s an interesting thing, because what it suggests...</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.500" end="00:26:31.160" style="s2">I mean, then you can imagine... I might say: well, how happy are you that you&#39;ve made a certain amount of progress?</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.160" end="00:26:37.340" style="s2">and if you think about it what you&#39;d say is: well, it depends on how much progress and in relationship to what</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.340" end="00:26:43.340" style="s2">so hypothetically you&#39;re gonna be happier if you&#39;d made quite a bit of progress towards a really important goal</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.340" end="00:26:48.180" style="s2">and then you have to think through what it means for a goal to be really important, &#39;cause that&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.180" end="00:26:53.460" style="s2">now, you could say: you&#39;re in this class, and you&#39;re listening to some information</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.460" end="00:27:00.780" style="s2">and maybe there&#39;s two reasons for that: you might find the information interesting per se, but let&#39;s forget about that for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.780" end="00:27:07.260" style="s2">you need to listen to the information so that you can do well on the assignment, so that you can do well in the class</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.260" end="00:27:10.900" style="s2">you need to do well in your class so that you can finish up your degree</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.900" end="00:27:14.220" style="s2">you need to finish up your degree so that you can find your place in the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.220" end="00:27:18.920" style="s2">you need to do that so that you&#39;re financially stable and maybe you can start a family and have a life</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.920" end="00:27:22.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s all part of being a good person, something like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.340" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">and so, that&#39;s a hierarchy of goals, and you might say that being a good person would be the thing, however vaguely thought through, that&#39;s at the top of that hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:39.860" style="s2">and then, when you&#39;re doing things that serve that ultimate purpose, then you&#39;re gonna find those more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.860" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">and that meaning is actually produced as a consequence of the engagement of this exploratory circuit</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:49.540" style="s2">that&#39;s nested right down in your hypothalamus, it&#39;s really, really, old</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.540" end="00:27:53.560" style="s2">it&#39;s as old as thirst, and it&#39;s as old as hunger, it&#39;s really an old system</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.560" end="00:27:59.920" style="s2">and so, you wanna have that thing activated, I mean, at least from a...</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.920" end="00:28:05.260" style="s2">well, it isn&#39;t only from a hedonic point of view, you know, it&#39;s a matter of being happy</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.260" end="00:28:09.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the wrong way of thinking about it, it&#39;s much more complicated than that, it&#39;s... yes?</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.480" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">[student] I was actually just about to ask like a hedonic element, &#39;cause I&#39;m just trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:25.020" style="s2">[student] this... I guess... not relationship but the differentiation between hedonism and satiation</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.020" end="00:28:30.940" style="s2">[student] and you... like going back to when you mentioned that it&#39;s not that life is meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.940" end="00:28:35.820" style="s2">[student] but hedonism isn&#39;t exactly... like it&#39;s not satiation, because</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.820" end="00:28:39.080" style="s2">[student] at that point people are just doing what they&#39;re doing for the sake doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.080" end="00:28:48.180" style="s2">[student] it&#39;s not just for activation of the dopaminergic system</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.180" end="00:28:51.080" style="s2">[student] so I was trying to understand...</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.080" end="00:28:57.740" style="s2">well, what I would say, we&#39;re going to into that A LOT once we&#39;re done with this, like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.740" end="00:29:01.220" style="s2">but I&#39;ll go over it briefly, I mean, it&#39;s not merely hedonism</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.220" end="00:29:08.040" style="s2">because there&#39;s an analgesic and also a fear-reducing element to pursuing a proper path</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.040" end="00:29:14.840" style="s2">right, so there&#39;s control of negative emotion, but there&#39;s not just control of negative emotion and generation of positive emotion in the immediate future</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.840" end="00:29:20.100" style="s2">which is kinda what you think about with regards to hedonism; actually, Pinokio takes a hedonic route next</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.100" end="00:29:25.700" style="s2">the problem with the hedonic route is that... so the pursuit of pure happiness, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.700" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">is that what makes you happy in the next minute might not be something that will make you happy in the next hour</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:36.820" style="s2">well you know that, there&#39;s this comic, what&#39;s his name, they call him king of the one-liners</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.820" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">he talked about drinking wine; don&#39;t you know that&#39;s gonna cause a hangover?</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:45.220" style="s2">and he said: yeah, at the end, but the beginning and middle are excellent</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.220" end="00:29:49.500" style="s2">and so that&#39;s really the problem with hedonism, right, is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.500" end="00:29:53.760" style="s2">to pursue something that makes you happy in the immediate present</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.760" end="00:30:00.920" style="s2">risks sacrificing your, well, many things, but at least, let&#39;s say, your hedonism in the medium to long term</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.920" end="00:30:05.420" style="s2">and of course that is one of the major problems with drug use, and alcohol&#39;s a really good example of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.420" end="00:30:10.460" style="s2">because whatever hedonic kick you might get from it that moment at night</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.460" end="00:30:17.060" style="s2">you&#39;re going to pay for almost completely or maybe even more so, because the next day you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.060" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">much more jittery and anxious, and that&#39;s a direct consequence of withdrawing from the drug</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">so when you&#39;re in... when you have a hangover you&#39;re in alcohol withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:31.700" style="s2">so that&#39;s how fast you get, roughly speaking, addicted to it</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.700" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">and so if you take another drink when you&#39;re hungover it&#39;ll cure it, but it&#39;s not a very useful cure</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">because all you do is push the inevitable hangover one more step into the future</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">and so part of the problem with the hedonic answer is: happy when?</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">exatly; and over what period of time? and also: who&#39;s happy?</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">because maybe something makes you happy but makes your family miserable</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">now, you could say, well, I don&#39;t care, but you do care if you have to live with your family</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:05.020" style="s2">because they&#39;re gonna take it out on you; so the impulsive hedonism, which is also fostered, say, by a positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.020" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">it tends to put people into a state of... the pursuit of short-term hedonism, it&#39;s not a good medium to long-term solution</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:17.980" style="s2">I actually think that&#39;s why people evolved conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.980" end="00:31:24.940" style="s2">right, &#39;cause conscientiousness is not happy, conscientious people aren&#39;t conscientious because it makes them happy</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.940" end="00:31:31.080" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to think that they&#39;re conscientious because they actually feel terrible if they&#39;re just sitting around doing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.080" end="00:31:38.500" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a way of staving off stress that&#39;s related to enforced leisure, something like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.500" end="00:31:43.340" style="s2">you know, if you know industrious people, some of you are industrious</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.340" end="00:31:47.900" style="s2">some of you will have industrious parents, they just can&#39;t sit around and do nothing, they have to be working</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.900" end="00:31:53.100" style="s2">they don&#39;t feel good unless they&#39;re working; so one thing about conscientiousness is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.100" end="00:31:59.740" style="s2">it involves continual sacrifice, right, you&#39;re doing difficult things in the present, hypothetically to make the future better</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.740" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">but that&#39;s not driven by hedonism by any stretch of the imagination; and conscientiousness is actually a pretty good predictor of long-term life success</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:12.680" style="s2">in stable societies; &#39;cause there&#39;s also no point in being conscientious and saving things up</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.680" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">and storing things if a bunch of thugs are gonna just come in randomly and take it all away</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:23.880" style="s2">so conscientiousness actually only works intelligently in societies that have some medium to long-term stability</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.880" end="00:32:29.580" style="s2">you know, &#39;cause you can get wiped out by hyperinflation, too, &#39;cause hyperinflation kills off the conscientious people</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.580" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">the people who accrued debts are thrilled when hyperinflation kicks in, because it wipes out their debts</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:39.040" style="s2">but of course those debts are the things they owed to people who were conscientious enough to save</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.040" end="00:32:47.520" style="s2">so anyways, Pinocchio is transformed into a victim, and he&#39;s offered this identity, and he takes it</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.520" end="00:32:50.920" style="s2">now, it&#39;s partly &#39;cause he&#39;s deceived and manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.920" end="00:33:01.700" style="s2">but it&#39;s also partly because the Fox offers him the abandonment of responsibility as payment for adopting the victim identity</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">so this is where his own lack of morality, let&#39;s say, &#39;cause this is all about Pinocchio&#39;s development as a character</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:13.020" style="s2">plays a role in his demise</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.020" end="00:33:18.680" style="s2">if I&#39;m a victim, everyone else owes me something, and I don&#39;t have to take any responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.680" end="00:33:22.920" style="s2">and so, one of the things I&#39;ve wondered... here&#39;s something to think about:</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.920" end="00:33:31.020" style="s2">it might be that the sense of meaning that life can provide to you is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you decide to take on</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.020" end="00:33:36.920" style="s2">and that&#39;d be very strange if it was the case, you know, because responsibility of course is a kind of weight, obviously</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.920" end="00:33:45.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s difficult to take on responsibility; but if any positive emotion that you feel and your control of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.460" end="00:33:53.140" style="s2">and the control over pain is dependent on the activation of the systems that watch you move towards a desired goal</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.140" end="00:34:01.920" style="s2">then the more complete and weighty the goal is, the more kick there&#39;s going to be in the observation that you&#39;re moving towards it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.920" end="00:34:07.060" style="s2">and you know, you kinda already know this, because you&#39;ll have observed in your own life</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.060" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">that when you&#39;re engaged in something that you believe in, that the time passes properly</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">you know, you can see this even if you&#39;re... maybe you&#39;re reading a paper and it&#39;s actually related in some intelligible manner to something that you wanna learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:28.380" style="s2">so even though it&#39;s difficult, you get engaged in it, you can remember it better, you process it better</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.380" end="00:34:34.360" style="s2">and you&#39;re not so likely to fall asleep, and you&#39;re not so likely to wanna find distractions, all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.360" end="00:34:40.680" style="s2">you can get into it; and it would be very interesting if that was proportionate to the degree of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.680" end="00:34:43.940" style="s2">that you&#39;re willing to shoulder, and I think you can make a strong case for that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.940" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">I&#39;ve also often wondered: imagine you could offer people a choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:54.900" style="s2">here&#39;s the choice: you can say, well, your life isn&#39;t meaningful, the nihilists have got it right</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.900" end="00:35:00.700" style="s2">there&#39;s no meaning in your life, and because of that there&#39;s no reason for you to accept any responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.700" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">so you can live a responsibility-free life and maybe one of impulsive pleasure-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:11.260" style="s2">but a responsibility-free life; but the price you pay is that it doesn&#39;t get to be meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.260" end="00:35:16.820" style="s2">or you could say to someone: no, we&#39;re gonna do the opposite, we&#39;re gonna say: you can live a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.820" end="00:35:22.460" style="s2">but it&#39;s only gonna be as meaningful as the amount of responsibility that you&#39;re willing to bear</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.460" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">and then you might say: well, what would people choose? &#39;cause everybody always makes noises about wanting to have a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:41.020" style="s2">but if the price you pay for that is the adoption of responsibility, then it&#39;s not so obvious people would choose meaning over pointless pursuits</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:48.600" style="s2">if they had to... if the benefit they got for choosing the pointless pursuits was that they didn&#39;t have to care about anything they ever did</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.600" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no responsibility, and that&#39;s really what Pinocchio is offered, and that&#39;s what the Coachman offers him</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:36:01.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s interesting, because, you know, so far it&#39;s been the Fox and the Cat, and they&#39;re kinda two-bit hoods</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.380" end="00:36:08.020" style="s2">and so, the pathological pathway that they offer Pinocchio is not the worst of the pathological pathways</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.020" end="00:36:13.960" style="s2">but here, at least as far as the imagination, the collective imagination that created this movie is concerned</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.960" end="00:36:19.360" style="s2">this is where you get to the most pathological form of, let&#39;s call it temptation</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.360" end="00:36:28.060" style="s2">and that&#39;s the temptation to engage in... to abandon responsibility and to engage in impulsive pleasure seeking</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.060" end="00:36:30.780" style="s2">short-term pleasure seeking</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.780" end="00:36:37.860" style="s2">so here&#39;s the Fox, pretending to be a doctor investigating Pinocchio&#39;s illness</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.860" end="00:36:44.520" style="s2">and he makes some notes, which is all just meaningless scribble</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.520" end="00:36:51.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like white noise, and it doesn&#39;t matter that the arguments that he&#39;s making  are completely incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.640" end="00:36:56.920" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t matter that he actually doesn&#39;t know anything, what he&#39;s selling is easy to buy</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.920" end="00:37:01.400" style="s2">and so Pinocchio buys it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.400" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">and by the end of the conversation with the Fox he&#39;s pretty convinced that he&#39;s useless</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:10.880" style="s2">and that he needs a vacation; you know...</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.880" end="00:37:20.600" style="s2">this is an oedipal situation as well, which I touched on the other lecture, I mean...</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.600" end="00:37:25.560" style="s2">let&#39;s imagine that you have a child that is a little on the neurotic side, so high negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.560" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2">and maybe one that&#39;s also a little bit on the sickly side, so it has a variety of relatively minor ailments, but ailments nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:42.020" style="s2">and so what that means as a parent, we&#39;ll say mother for this example, &#39;cause I want to use the oedipal example</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.020" end="00:37:46.980" style="s2">you have to make a decision all the time about exactly how you&#39;re gonna treat that child</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.980" end="00:37:54.680" style="s2">one decision is: well, I&#39;m not gonna... you don&#39;t have to go to school today, because you&#39;re not feeling well, but</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.680" end="00:38:02.360" style="s2">fair enough, but do you make the same decision the next day? and do you make the same decision the next day?</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.360" end="00:38:10.280" style="s2">and let&#39;s imagine that you enable the child to avoid responsibility as a consequence of capitalizing on their illness</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.280" end="00:38:15.620" style="s2">well then that&#39;s not gonna be very good for the child, the rule with a sickly child has to be something like:</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.620" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna push you right to your limit; because otherwise how is the person gonna figure out what they can do?</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">and if they can&#39;t figure out what they can do, then they&#39;re not gonna be able to make their way in the world at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:33.360" style="s2">and then that gets muddied very badly if you&#39;re not exactly sure that you want them to make their way in the world, you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.360" end="00:38:38.920" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re just as happy, because you&#39;d be sitting at home, alone if your child was there with you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.920" end="00:38:42.960" style="s2">and maybe you&#39;d be just as happy at some level if they never grew up at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.960" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">because then they won&#39;t leave; and maybe that&#39;s because you have a terrible marriage, and you&#39;re lonesome, you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:53.320" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s an abusive marriage and your husband has chased away all your friends</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.320" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t have anything at all, and maybe that&#39;s &#39;cause you didn&#39;t stand up for yourself very well</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">apart from the fact that he was, you know, tyrannical in his central nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:09.320" style="s2">and so then all those little warps and bends in your psyche are gonna manifest themselves right...</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.320" end="00:39:14.360" style="s2">right in the background of every one of those decisions</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.360" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">my daughter had a lot of illnesses when she was adolescent, and they were very serious, and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:27.860" style="s2">it was very difficult to figure out what to do about that, because you couldn&#39;t exactly apply normative rules, right?</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.860" end="00:39:35.740" style="s2">and we always had to figure out if she was communicating her symptoms to us, how seriously to take those</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.740" end="00:39:42.300" style="s2">and the answer was: the least amount of serious possible, it&#39;s something like that, because</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.300" end="00:39:47.980" style="s2">we needed to know, and she needed to know, what she could do in spite of the fact that she  had problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.980" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">and one of the things I really tried to instill in her, and I think it worked, is that:</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:58.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t ever wanna use your illness as an excuse for not doing anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.080" end="00:40:02.180" style="s2">not consciously, you know, sometimes you might not know, &quot;I&#39;m not feeling well, what can I do?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.180" end="00:40:08.500" style="s2">well you don&#39;t know, right, because sometimes when you&#39;re not feeling well, you can do more than you think, and sometimes you can do less than you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.500" end="00:40:14.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s obvious, but sometimes it&#39;s obvious, you know, this little temptation flits through your mind, and you think:</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.260" end="00:40:18.740" style="s2">well, I don&#39;t really wanna do what I&#39;m doing today, and I&#39;m not feeling very well, so I don&#39;t have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.740" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">you do that a hundred times, and *you* don&#39;t know how sick you are anymore</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:29.560" style="s2">and then you&#39;re in real trouble, because not only are you sick, but you actually have... you&#39;ve muddied the waters</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.560" end="00:40:36.500" style="s2">and so you have both problems, is you&#39;re actually ill, and you&#39;ve  betrayed yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.500" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">by using that as an excuse not to pursue your responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:45.820" style="s2">and that, I think, if both of those thing happen to you at the same time, you&#39;re in real trouble</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.820" end="00:40:49.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s really hard not to have that happen</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.540" end="00:40:54.060" style="s2">so anyways, Pinokio gets enticed into believing he&#39;s a victim</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:41:04.220" style="s2">the fact that he&#39;s insufficient is used as an excuse by the fox and the cat to offer him a trip to Pleasure Island</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.220" end="00:41:07.460" style="s2">and this is, I think, where the movie gets particularly dark</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.460" end="00:41:11.840" style="s2">and so off they go, singing away; they have to carry him</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.840" end="00:41:18.200" style="s2">so you could say in some sense he&#39;s carried by societal pathology and his own trouble</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.200" end="00:41:24.520" style="s2">he&#39;s carried like a puppet off to Pleasure Island; and so the Cricket...</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.520" end="00:41:29.100" style="s2">the Cricket is again left behind, he&#39;s not the world&#39;s best conscience at this point</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.100" end="00:41:36.400" style="s2">so, Pinokio goes off to meet the Coachman, and the Coachman has already said he&#39;s collecting bad little boys</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.400" end="00:41:41.840" style="s2">and he&#39;s got them on the coach, they&#39;re all delinquent types here</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.840" end="00:41:46.540" style="s2">and the ticket on the coach was the ace of spades, which is what Pinocchio is holding</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.540" end="00:41:51.140" style="s2">and he&#39;s with this character here, called Lampwick</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.140" end="00:41:56.940" style="s2">and that&#39;s an interesting name, so he&#39;s the thing that burns in the middle of a light, lamp wick</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.940" end="00:42:02.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s interesting, because it&#39;s a play on Lucifer, &#39;cause Lucifer means &#39;bringer of light&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.600" end="00:42:07.880" style="s2">and so Lampwick is a play on that, and Lampwick is really a nasty piece of work</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.880" end="00:42:13.460" style="s2">he&#39;s got this false arrogance about him, he&#39;s got this cynical voice, really deeply cynical voice</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.460" end="00:42:18.340" style="s2">and he&#39;s only... I don&#39;t know how old he&#39;s supposed to be in this, maybe 12 or something like that, 13</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.340" end="00:42:22.700" style="s2">And so he&#39;s one of those kids who&#39;s become prematurely cynical</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.700" end="00:42:26.300" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you a story about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.300" end="00:42:31.220" style="s2">so I used to live in Montreal, I lived in a poor neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.220" end="00:42:39.500" style="s2">and one day I was out in the back alley, building a fence, &#39;cause I was putting a fence around my little tiny back yard</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.500" end="00:42:45.980" style="s2">and there was a house across the alley down the street aways, where there was a lot of, like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.980" end="00:42:51.900" style="s2">not good partying, a lot of bikers were hanging around there, ans I knew there was a little kid that lived there as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.900" end="00:42:56.140" style="s2">anyways, I was out there in the back alley, pounding away on my fence, and these little kids came up</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.140" end="00:43:02.920" style="s2">and they were little, they were like 3 and 4 years old, hey, and they spoke joual</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.920" end="00:43:07.560" style="s2">a kind of really heavily accented quebecois french, and my french isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.560" end="00:43:13.300" style="s2">so I could hardly understand them; but they were watching me hammer, and they got a little closer</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.300" end="00:43:17.640" style="s2">and they had one kid who was clearly the leader, had a real scowl on his face, eh?</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.640" end="00:43:22.100" style="s2">and so they were watching, and I kinda motioned to one of them, that they could use the hammer</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.100" end="00:43:27.600" style="s2">and that kid said, and I&#39;m gonna mangle this, but he said &quot;je voulai&quot; or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.600" end="00:43:33.220" style="s2">and what it meant is &quot;I&#39;ll steal that&quot;; and so I thought... you know, and then he came over and he tugged on it</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.220" end="00:43:38.980" style="s2">and he wanted to take it, and he was quite angry that I wasn&#39;t gonna let him take it, and then so...</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.980" end="00:43:44.860" style="s2">so I couldn&#39;t engage him, I couldn&#39;t get him to play, you know, and his buddies were sort of hanging around behind him, and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.860" end="00:43:49.740" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t come and play, because he wouldn&#39;t, and so he was hostile right away to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.740" end="00:43:58.200" style="s2">and then... so the fence piece was laying out in the alley, and these little monsters started running across it</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.200" end="00:44:04.700" style="s2">which I thought was really remarkable, you know, but it was terrible at the same time, because they were really little kids</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.700" end="00:44:09.840" style="s2">that shouldn&#39;t be happening when you&#39;re like 3 or 4; if that&#39;s happening at that age, things are not good</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.840" end="00:44:15.240" style="s2">and so that kid was already like seriously not happy with the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.240" end="00:44:20.700" style="s2">and you know, I&#39;ve been studying antisocial behavior for a long time by that point, and I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.700" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">the kids who are destined to jail later in their lives are kids who are rough and tough when they&#39;re two years old, but then don&#39;t get socialized</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:35.780" style="s2">or maybe worse, they get anti-socialized, which is exactly what happened to this kid, he&#39;d obviously been ignored and abused</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.780" end="00:44:43.460" style="s2">certainly no one had ever played with him in any real way, because he wouldn&#39;t play; and it&#39;s not good if a kid is that little</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.460" end="00:44:50.920" style="s2">and you can&#39;t get them to play, something&#39;s gone seriously wrong, &#39;cause they&#39;re so playful at that age, that it&#39;s like 90% of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.920" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">anyways, so they were running back and forth on this fence, I thought, stomping on it, you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:45:02.540" style="s2">and I was right there, I thought, well, first of all I thought that was remarkable, but I also thought it was absolutely horrifying, because</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.540" end="00:45:06.760" style="s2">you know, in some sense I could see where this kid was headed and why</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.760" end="00:45:12.200" style="s2">at that early stage in his life, it&#39;s really... it&#39;s not a pleasant thing to behold</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.200" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">but there was nothing that could be done about it, and that... kinda what this Lampwick is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:20.900" style="s2">he&#39;s prematurely cynical, this kid was already cynical, and he was like 4 years old</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.900" end="00:45:29.600" style="s2">you know, most kids don&#39;t get cynical &#39;till they&#39;re teenagers, and then often they don&#39;t get completely cynical and usually they more or less grow out of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.600" end="00:45:35.380" style="s2">but it happened to him much earlier; so this Lampwick character, he&#39;s already decided that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.380" end="00:45:40.020" style="s2">he knows everything, that everyone else&#39;s opinion is worth nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.020" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">and that there&#39;s nothing in cultre or society that holds any utility whatsoever for someone like him</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">now, you can imagine developing that way, if you were raised in a family where people were generally lying to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:46:01.720" style="s2">and that they randomly treated you or neglected you, and that you couldn&#39;t discern anything about them that was admirable or positive</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.720" end="00:46:09.780" style="s2">of course you assume the whole structure is corrupt, and that you had to take care of yourself, and no one else</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.780" end="00:46:14.660" style="s2">well, not of course, not everyone assumes that under those situations, I shouldn&#39;t say &quot;of course&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.660" end="00:46:19.060" style="s2">but it&#39;s a logical set of conclusions, so...</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.060" end="00:46:26.280" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s proportionate to some degree to how much abuse you tak, althought there are lots of stories of people who&#39;ve been terribly abused as children</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.280" end="00:46:33.140" style="s2">who grew up to be, you know, kind, remarkable, responsible, thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.140" end="00:46:37.220" style="s2">people who were absolutely opposed to abuse, instead of propagating it</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.220" end="00:46:40.080" style="s2">there&#39;s no direct causal pathway</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.080" end="00:46:47.720" style="s2">anyways, Lampwick is pretty happy to be on this coach way to Pleasure Island which he&#39;s heard about</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.720" end="00:46:54.120" style="s2">he said, &quot;well, it&#39;s all you can eat, all you can smoke, you don&#39;t have to do any work, you can do anything you want&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.120" end="00:47:00.520" style="s2">so you might say, well, it&#39;s too good to be true, like the ginger bread house in the Hansel and Grettel story</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.520" end="00:47:07.660" style="s2">right, the kids are lost, there&#39;s a ginger bread house, it&#39;s a house, which is something they need, and it&#39;s made out of cookies</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.660" end="00:47:13.400" style="s2">it looks like it&#39;s a little bit too good to be true, and of course in the house there&#39;s the negative part of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.400" end="00:47:24.660" style="s2">which is the old witch who wants to eat children; and that&#39;s a story about what happens to people if they&#39;re offered more than they should be offered</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.660" end="00:47:32.180" style="s2">so... anyways, Lampwick is firing off... he has a little slingshot</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.180" end="00:47:39.380" style="s2">and he&#39;s firing off pebbles at the horses who are pulling the carriage, and that&#39;s just the kind of guy that he is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.380" end="00:47:46.200" style="s2">so he takes Pinocchio under his wing; and the Cricket is down there in the dust, he&#39;s caught back up to the carriage</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.200" end="00:47:50.420" style="s2">but he&#39;s having a rough time at this point</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.420" end="00:47:54.300" style="s2">this is also a story, to some degree, about transitioning to adolescence</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.300" end="00:47:59.840" style="s2">you know, because adolescence is a time when people are pretty impulsive, and their view is quite short-term</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.840" end="00:48:06.620" style="s2">and are more likely to pursue immediate pleasures and all of that, and that can get really out of hand, so...</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.620" end="00:48:13.940" style="s2">anyways, they separate from the mainland, and go on a boat, and so they&#39;re off to Pleasure Island</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.940" end="00:48:24.580" style="s2">a dark place; and the Coachman opens the gates and lets the delinquents into Pleasure Island, and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.580" end="00:48:35.780" style="s2">they basically have a riot; and this is Pleasure Island, here, it&#39;s full of amusement park rides, and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.780" end="00:48:42.540" style="s2">you know, one of the things that&#39;s kind of interesting about horror movies, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed this, is that they&#39;re often set in amusement parks</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.540" end="00:48:50.280" style="s2">and clowns are often characters of horror, we&#39;ll leave the clowns aside for now, but the amusement park thing, that&#39;s pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.280" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">why in the world would an amusement park be a place of horror?</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:49:02.920" style="s2">and the first question might be: well, have you ever been to an amusement park? because there is something about them, that&#39;s really...</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.920" end="00:49:08.020" style="s2">they have a dark side, a clear dark side, and part of it is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.020" end="00:49:16.680" style="s2">people with nothing better to do are spending money stupidly, and they&#39;re being fleeced by the people who operate the amusement park</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.680" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">you know, and they have, let&#39;s say, a stereotypically dark reputation</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:27.500" style="s2">and they&#39;re moving around all the time, this is also something that psychopaths do</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.500" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">and all they&#39;re doing is moving from community to community, and taking the money from the rubes, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">and so, the amusement park, well...</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:45.080" style="s2">if you walk through an amusement park with that sort of thing in mind, maybe that&#39;s also coloring your vision, of course, but</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.080" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">it&#39;s something that you could see very immediately; so there&#39;s something about them that&#39;s deeply sad, but there&#39;s also an underlying horror that characterizes them</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:50:00.280" style="s2">it&#39;s easy for a horror movie or horror novel writers to immediately expand upon, there&#39;s something about it that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.280" end="00:50:04.620" style="s2">that makes sense to people, so...</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.620" end="00:50:09.860" style="s2">it&#39;s too easy, maybe that&#39;s... and it&#39;s also all short-term gratification, that&#39;s the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.860" end="00:50:12.940" style="s2">so you spend your money very rapidly, and it&#39;s gone; yes?</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.940" end="00:50:17.820" style="s2">[student] seems like a celebration of meanings divorced from reality (?)</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.820" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:24.820" style="s2">yes, exactly, well, that&#39;s the impulsive element; the comment was it&#39;s a celebration of meanings divorced from reality</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.820" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">yeah, it&#39;s also outside of reality, right, that&#39;s why it&#39;s on an island, it&#39;s a separate universe</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:35.180" style="s2">and it&#39;s a universe where nothig that&#39;s happening is connected to anything outside</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.180" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re spending your hard-earned money, let&#39;s say, but it isn&#39;t that much... it&#39;s certainly not an investment</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:48.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not that much different than burning it, well, it is, because of course you get some pleasure out of it, but</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.600" end="00:50:57.880" style="s2">it isn&#39;t... going there every day is probably not the wisest move that you could make, so...</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.880" end="00:51:05.700" style="s2">the animators do a good job of, well, of presenting the, what would you call it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.700" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">the enforced hedonism, I guess I would say, of a place like that; this is a place where you&#39;re gonna have fun, that&#39;s what it&#39;s for, so...</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:19.560" style="s2">anyways, Lampwick, who&#39;s got this very arrogant look on his face, and this kind of strut</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.560" end="00:51:24.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a bravado, that&#39;s what it&#39;s called, it&#39;s a false confidence</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.500" end="00:51:30.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of thing that people do when they&#39;re trying to impress upon others that they&#39;re high in the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.440" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">but really they&#39;re not, so it&#39;s a mimicry of dominance</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:42.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s something that can be intimidating, there&#39;s no doubt about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.340" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">I had a friend, he didn&#39;t come to a good end</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">this person who was a real good friend of mine, when I was in junior high and high school, and he was kind of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.800" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">and he was tall, he was a bout six foot seven, and he was pretty thin</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:06.660" style="s2">and we used to go out to the bar now and then, and in many of the bars that we were in, we lived in this little town</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.660" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">there were bullies, and these were guys... and I worked in the bars, and I used to watch these guys, and they&#39;d basically...</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:15.920" style="s2">there was a handful of them in town, pretty psychopathic types</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.920" end="00:52:20.100" style="s2">and they&#39;d go to the bar, and all they&#39;d do is sit there and wait for someone to come in who they could beat up</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.100" end="00:52:24.480" style="s2">they knew who it was as soon as they walked in, that&#39;s actually why they were at the bar</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.480" end="00:52:32.900" style="s2">and so they&#39;d wait &#39;till someone came in, who didn&#39;t look very confident, and who could likely be intimidated by this sort of thing, and then they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.900" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">tell him to come outside for a fight, and if they didn&#39;t, well then they&#39;d of course make fun of him, and if they did, well, generally they&#39;d beat them up</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:46.260" style="s2">my friend kinda caught on to this trick, and he started going into bars, and every time that someone like that came near him</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.260" end="00:52:50.300" style="s2">he&#39;d go outside and fight with them; and one of the things he observed right away is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.300" end="00:52:55.340" style="s2">almost inevitably when he went outside with them, they&#39;d shake hands and make friends</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.340" end="00:53:01.540" style="s2">so as soon as he... and it was realy remarkable, watching him, &#39;cause he wasn&#39;t a particularly physically powerful person</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.540" end="00:53:07.960" style="s2">although he was extraordinarily tall; but he had started to play this game, and he did it for  along time, and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.960" end="00:53:14.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember him ever actually having to fight, he just stared them down, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.320" end="00:53:23.700" style="s2">so it was a very interesting thing to watch, but it was an indication to me of exactly how shallow this kind of bravado, bullying actually is</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.700" end="00:53:32.360" style="s2">but people don&#39;t find that out, because they won&#39;t stand up, and it&#39;s not surprising, but...</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.360" end="00:53:38.540" style="s2">anyways, they load up on food, Pinocchio&#39;s carrying a pie and a an ice cream cone simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.540" end="00:53:44.060" style="s2">and then they&#39;re off to have a fight, and Lampwick says something like:</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.060" end="00:53:48.980" style="s2">it&#39;s good to punch someone in the nose sometimes just for the, I think he says, heck of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.980" end="00:53:52.900" style="s2">and so Pinokio adopts this strut, and in they go to the roughhouse</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.900" end="00:54:01.480" style="s2">and then, in the next scene, you see this model home up for destruction, it&#39;s quite an interesting scene symbolically, you see...</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.480" end="00:54:08.740" style="s2">in the middle of this house here there&#39;s a stained-glass window that has a mandala on it, we&#39;ll see it more clearly in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.740" end="00:54:14.320" style="s2">and a mandala is a sacred symbol of the Self, that&#39;s the Jungian interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.320" end="00:54:18.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a symbol... it&#39;s very difficult to describe, but it&#39;s a symbol...</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.200" end="00:54:26.760" style="s2">music is a mandala, except it&#39;s  played out across time, so you could say that thing is the same as music, but it&#39;s kinda like a slice of music</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.760" end="00:54:34.900" style="s2">it&#39;s the same idea, you know sometimes you see those slow-motion or sped-up-motion videos of a flower unfolding?</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.900" end="00:54:40.300" style="s2">that&#39;s the same idea, you can imagine that being se to music, and somehow that would make sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.300" end="00:54:47.220" style="s2">and the mandala&#39;s like a symbol of the unfolding of being, or the source of meaning, or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.220" end="00:54:52.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s also a symbol of the Self from the jungian perspective</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.860" end="00:54:57.000" style="s2">so there you see it more clearly; the kids are starting to burn this place</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.000" end="00:55:03.180" style="s2">and trash it, and they&#39;re dragging the grand piano down the stairs, it&#39;s a destruction of high culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.180" end="00:55:08.320" style="s2">about which they are nothing but cynical, &#39;cause they don&#39;t believe that hard work and sacrifice can</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.320" end="00:55:16.560" style="s2">can produce something of any value, and they want to bring it down and destroy it, and that&#39;s partly because...</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.560" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">you can see this in the story of Cain and Able</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:25.860" style="s2">Able is hardworking and everyone likes him, and he makes the proper sacrifices, and so his life goes pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.860" end="00:55:31.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the reason Cain hates it, and he&#39;s jealous and resentful, but worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.340" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re around someone, if you&#39;re not doing very well, especially if that&#39;s your own fault</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re not doing very well, and you&#39;re around someone who&#39;s doing very well, it&#39;s very painful, because</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:46.840" style="s2">the mere fact of their being judges you, and so it&#39;s very easy to wanna destroy that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.840" end="00:55:55.700" style="s2">to destroy that ideal so that you don&#39;t have to live with the terrible consequences of seeing it embodied in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.700" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">and so part of the reason that people wanna tear things down is so that they don&#39;t have anything to contrast themselves against and to feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:11.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening here, the kids are destroying all of this culture, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.180" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">because it judges them; the fact that it exists judges them; and I&#39;ve often thought this about Michelangelo&#39;s statue of David</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:25.580" style="s2">which is this heroic... so David was a shepherd, obviously, and it doesn&#39;t sound like much, but</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.580" end="00:56:30.940" style="s2">back in those times being a shepherd was a big deal, because there were lions, and you had a slingshot</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.940" end="00:56:35.360" style="s2">so like, you&#39;ve got to defend your sheep from lions with a slingshot</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.360" end="00:56:41.340" style="s2">so you weren&#39;t exactly this, like, 19th century English guy dressed in a, you know, frilly blue suit</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.340" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">you were tough as a bloody... well, someone who would go after a lion with a slingshot, it&#39;s no joke</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:54.140" style="s2">anyways, the statue is very heroic, and, you know, you look at that, you think, well, that&#39;s the possibility of human kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.140" end="00:56:59.700" style="s2">but by the same token it&#39;s also what you&#39;re not, and so, as well as being an ideal, it&#39;s a judge</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.700" end="00:57:02.900" style="s2">and every ideal is a judge, so... yes?</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.900" end="00:57:10.960" style="s2">[student] going back to your example of Cain and Able, um, so you&#39;re using that as an example illustrating</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.960" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">[student] becoming bitter as a result of not being able to achieve status... success as a result of hard work</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:34.200" style="s2">[student] but in the example of Cain and Able, um, like one was a shepherd, and one was a farmer, and the one who was favored</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.200" end="00:57:39.780" style="s2">[student] so was that a result of the hard work or was that a result of... (agriculture being favored?)</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.780" end="00:57:45.180" style="s2">good question, those stories are very compicated</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.180" end="00:57:51.100" style="s2">and the story is very ambivalent about whether Cain is not rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.100" end="00:57:56.320" style="s2">or beause God&#39;s just in a bad mood; I like that... if you read the story</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.320" end="00:58:02.340" style="s2">I read multiple translations of the story, and when Cain comes to God to complain</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.340" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">God basically tells him: look, buddy, before you go about criticizing the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:16.800" style="s2">you should look to your own inadequacies; he says: sin crouches at your door like a predatory, sexually aroused animal</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.800" end="00:58:21.980" style="s2">and you invited it in to have its way with you, and something has emerged as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.980" end="00:58:26.140" style="s2">so don&#39;t be botherin&#39; me about my creation before you look to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.140" end="00:58:35.420" style="s2">so there&#39;s a very strong hint that the reason that God has not favored Cain&#39;s sacrifices because they weren&#39;t of particularly good quality</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.420" end="00:58:41.460" style="s2">but it is ambivalent in the story, and there is the sheperd versus farmer motif as well</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.460" end="00:58:47.540" style="s2">and of course that motif runs through the entire corpus of stories to some degree, especially the shepherd motif</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.540" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">so, it&#39;s only about a paragraph long, that whole story and it packs all that into that tiny little amount of space</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.920" end="00:58:58.540" style="s2">but the idea that Cain kills Abel to get rid of his ideal</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.540" end="00:59:04.340" style="s2">and also to punish God, roughly speaking, it&#39;s a brilliant story; I mean...</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.340" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">these guys who go around shooting up highschools, they&#39;re shooting at... highschools in particular, but...</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:16.860" style="s2">you know, they&#39;re definitely out for revenge, and what they&#39;re revenging themselves against or to who is not exactly clear</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.860" end="00:59:20.780" style="s2">anyways, so these kids are just tearing down this model home</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.780" end="00:59:26.380" style="s2">tearing down western civilization, I suppose is another way of looking at it, or just tearing down civilization, period</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.380" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">and Pinokio&#39;s having a pretty good time, he&#39;s got his axe, and he&#39;s looking a little malevolent there</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">and happy to be destroying things, which is of course a pretty simple thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.640" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s that image that I told you about, the mandala, and that&#39;s a flower in this image</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:47.500" style="s2">and so, what happens is that, I think it&#39;s Lampwick, throws a brick through it</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.500" end="00:59:54.540" style="s2">and so, what that means symbolically: the self is a symbol of your potential, among very many other things</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.540" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">but by engaging in this sort of impulsive, destructive activity Lampwick and Pinocchio are making it impossible to further their development</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:07.500" style="s2">and they&#39;re doing that to some degree consciously, they basically say: to hell with it</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.500" end="01:00:16.320" style="s2">and toss a brick through this highest ideal, the thing through which light shines, so also that harkens back to the star as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.320" end="01:00:21.700" style="s2">so, anyways, the coachman is paying attention to all this</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.700" end="01:00:28.580" style="s2">and he&#39;s actually pretty happy about the fact that these boys are so involved in their stupid amusements</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.580" end="01:00:32.180" style="s2">that they&#39;re not paying any attention to what&#39;s actually going on</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.180" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">he calls these people out of the darkness, these creatures out of the darkness, so...</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:42.120" style="s2">you get these black... you can hardly see them there, but theyre black cloaked figures with glowing eyes</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.120" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re shutting the door of the amusement park</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:50.700" style="s2">and that&#39;s very interesting, it&#39;s an extraordinarily interesting happening</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.700" end="01:00:55.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like, ok, so all of a sudden the amusement park... we already know that the Coachman is up to no good</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.980" end="01:01:00.860" style="s2">but now he&#39;s got these minions that are faceless in some sense, they&#39;re clearly creatures of the night</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.860" end="01:01:05.080" style="s2">and they&#39;re up to no good, and so you have this sense that...</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.080" end="01:01:09.340" style="s2">that the boys are being offered bread and circuses, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.340" end="01:01:12.940" style="s2">but there&#39;s something... there&#39;s a real reason for it, there&#39;s a manipulative reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.940" end="01:01:21.560" style="s2">for it, they&#39;re being enticed into a trap, the doors are closed, and these underground beings are involved in the plot</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.560" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">and obviously the coachman understands this perfectly well; so one of the ways to understand this</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:33.220" style="s2">is to think about what totalitarian states have to offer their populace, and</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.220" end="01:01:36.780" style="s2">what they offer them, and this happened particularly as Rome declined, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.780" end="01:01:40.440" style="s2">that&#39;s where the term bread and circuses originally came from, is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.440" end="01:01:46.900" style="s2">as the situation degenerates, then people have to be offered stupid amusements more and more frequently</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.900" end="01:01:52.580" style="s2">in order for them ignore what&#39;s actually going on in the background</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.580" end="01:01:56.060" style="s2">you know, a war can be that kind of stupid  amusement</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.060" end="01:02:03.700" style="s2">anyways, later that night the entire place is completely devastated, and all we see is the wreckage of everything that was there before</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.700" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">and again the Cricket has gotten separated from Pinocchio, and so he&#39;s trying to find him</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">and Pinocchio ends up in this... this bar that&#39;s shaped like an 8-ball</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:21.020" style="s2">the 8-ball is kind of the random ball in pool, and anyways he&#39;s inside the 8-ball, and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.020" end="01:02:28.040" style="s2">he&#39;s shooting pool with Lampwick, and that&#39;s just another indication of wasting his time, basically, and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.040" end="01:02:33.920" style="s2">you can see in the forefront there&#39;s some cards for gambling, so he&#39;s engaged in these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.920" end="01:02:43.500" style="s2">you might say, pointless, hedonic hedonic pursuits, and he&#39;s enticing Pinocchio along the same route, and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.500" end="01:02:51.640" style="s2">he teaches him to smoke, first, that doesn&#39;t go very well, so Pinocchio takes a huge drag on his cigar</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.640" end="01:02:56.660" style="s2">and it just about kills him, and when Lampwick asks him how he likes it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.660" end="01:03:03.100" style="s2">he shakes his head and says, you know, that it&#39;s really, was really quite good, but he&#39;s so sick that he can hardly stand up</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.100" end="01:03:06.980" style="s2">and he&#39;s hallucinating double balls on the pool table, and</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.980" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">then the cricket shows up and stands on the 8-ball, and kinda gives him one of those declamatory speeches again</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:19.600" style="s2">you know, &#39;cause he still hasn&#39;t quite figured out that standing up proud and spouting off the rules isn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.600" end="01:03:25.940" style="s2">the right way for the conscience to behave; and Lampwick picks him up by the scruff of the neck</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.940" end="01:03:32.160" style="s2">roughly speaking, and first of all asks who he is, so obviously he&#39;s divorced from his own conscience</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.160" end="01:03:37.920" style="s2">and then makes fun of Pinocchio for paying attention to this little bug, and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.920" end="01:03:42.680" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a nice indication of what happens at adolescence, you know, because</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.680" end="01:03:49.540" style="s2">of course as children move away from their parents and into their groups, especially when the groups are misbehaving</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.540" end="01:03:56.740" style="s2">often what happens is that the other members of the group will torture a person who isn&#39;t willing to try something dangerous or foolish</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.740" end="01:04:01.880" style="s2">by making fun of the fact that they&#39;re, you know, too attached to their conscience</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.880" end="01:04:09.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive element to that, because you should take some risks when you&#39;re a teenager, and also later in life, and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.460" end="01:04:14.180" style="s2">if you won&#39;t take any risks, there&#39;s actually something wrong with you, but there&#39;s a negative element in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.180" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">well, you know, teenagers do all sorts of stupid things, and perhaps it&#39;s amazing that we all live all live through it actually, as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:28.060" style="s2">some people take extraordinary risks, extraordinary risks</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.060" end="01:04:34.700" style="s2">and they don&#39;t make it through at all or they end up in the permanently antisocial population</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.700" end="01:04:42.660" style="s2">and then they&#39;re, you know, basically carreer criminals; five percent of the criminals commint 95% of the crimes</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.660" end="01:04:46.680" style="s2">it&#39;s another Pareto distribution, so...</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.680" end="01:04:53.520" style="s2">anyways, Lampwick isn&#39;t gonna listen to Pinocchio or to the Cricket, he laughs at him with this kind of braying laugh</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.520" end="01:04:58.700" style="s2">which is some foreshadowing, and the Cricket gets all upset, puts his coat on backwards</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.700" end="01:05:05.580" style="s2">and ends up dumped down a pool table hole, and otherwise abused, and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.580" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">he stomps on out of there, he tells Pinocchio that he can take care of himself, and he stomps on out of there</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:17.120" style="s2">and so Pinocchio is left without the guidance of conscience, and the Cricket is trying to figure out how to get off Pleasure Island</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.120" end="01:05:23.100" style="s2">BUT! he goes through the gates and he sees what&#39;s actually going on</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.100" end="01:05:28.080" style="s2">and what&#39;s going on is that the Coachman had this like slave boat</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.080" end="01:05:35.440" style="s2">down in the bowels of the island, and he&#39;s got all these black-suited minions with the glowing eyes</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.440" end="01:05:40.460" style="s2">working for him, and they&#39;re rounding up what looked like donkeys</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.460" end="01:05:45.560" style="s2">and so they&#39;re beast of burden, right? and so there&#39;s an idea here that if you produce...</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.560" end="01:05:50.200" style="s2">if you pursue impulsive pleasure to the detriment of the development of your character</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.200" end="01:05:54.800" style="s2">you&#39;re going to end up a beast of burden, you&#39;re going to end up a slave to a tyrant</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.800" end="01:05:59.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly right, and so, anyways, the Cricket doesn&#39;t...</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.140" end="01:06:05.100" style="s2">you can see one of those black-suited horrors here, hauling donkeys out of this crate</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.100" end="01:06:09.300" style="s2">and one of them has a hat on, and they look very sad</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.300" end="01:06:14.480" style="s2">and they&#39;re in different crates, and one of them says: sold to the salt mines, and one of them says: sold to the circus</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">so they&#39;re shipped off to be slaves, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:24.440" style="s2">and they look very sad, and then one of them gets hauled out of a crate, and he&#39;s still got a hat on</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.440" end="01:06:29.860" style="s2">he has a hat on and a sweater, and he can still talk, he&#39;s a boy, it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.860" end="01:06:35.980" style="s2">that&#39;s been half-transformed into a jackass, a brying jackass prior to being enslaved</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.980" end="01:06:42.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s another thing that&#39;s quite interesting about the story, you know, it also makes the case that if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.080" end="01:06:50.460" style="s2">replace your voice with stupid braying, that the probability that you&#39;re going to become enslaved by a tyrant is extraordinarily high</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.460" end="01:06:57.260" style="s2">and I always can&#39;t help but think about ideologues in that manner, you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.260" end="01:07:02.220" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn wrote about the radical left ideologues that got thrown in the gulag archipelago, you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.220" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">so they were part stalwarts, this happened to a lot of people, true believers</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:12.300" style="s2">who were vacuumed up by the stalinist machine and thrown into the gulag anyways, and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.300" end="01:07:16.800" style="s2">he said that those people suffered in some ways more than everyone else, because</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.800" end="01:07:20.240" style="s2">what did he say? they were  bit by the beloved hand that fed them</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.240" end="01:07:24.340" style="s2">and so the first while when they were in the camps, Solzhenitsyn didn&#39;t really know what to do with people like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.340" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">because on the one hand, well, they were in the camps, and wasn&#39;t that awful, and they&#39;ve been torn away from their family</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:34.620" style="s2">and you know, stripped of all their identity, and their status, so that&#39;s pretty rough</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.620" end="01:07:38.120" style="s2">but on the other hand they were writing letters protesting their innocence</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.120" end="01:07:46.300" style="s2">and assuming that everyone else in the camp was guilty, but they were innocent, and they were still strident believers in the communist process</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.300" end="01:07:51.400" style="s2">and so, you know, it was a conundrum, here they are being terribly punished</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.400" end="01:07:56.460" style="s2">but by the same token they&#39;re also the perpetrators of their own demise, so how do you deal with them?</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.460" end="01:08:00.680" style="s2">they used to play &quot;comrades&quot;, he said they used to play &quot;comrades&quot; with people like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.680" end="01:08:08.180" style="s2">and invite them into an ideological discussion about the camp situation, and the situation in the country as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.180" end="01:08:14.320" style="s2">and let them rattle out their ideological justifications for everything that had happened</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.320" end="01:08:19.840" style="s2">trying to make them parody themselves, roughly speaking, it was a rough game</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.840" end="01:08:28.360" style="s2">and Solzhenitsyn also concluded that there was no helping someone like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.360" end="01:08:34.140" style="s2">when they were still ensconced inside that braying ideology, you could predict everything they were going to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.140" end="01:08:39.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like someone had a crank, you could just crank it, and out would come the proper ideological formulas</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.240" end="01:08:44.580" style="s2">but then he realized that as soon as they, let&#39;s call it, repented of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.580" end="01:08:48.620" style="s2">and started to realize they&#39;re own role in it or the error of the system</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.620" end="01:08:57.020" style="s2">then he would start communicating with them, you know, as if they were people who you could communicate with</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.020" end="01:08:59.960" style="s2">yeah, that was very interesting, as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.960" end="01:09:05.200" style="s2">anyways, this kid is still a little bit human, he starts to cry for his mom</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.200" end="01:09:09.560" style="s2">and the Coachman basically throws him back into the crate and says that he&#39;s not ready yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.560" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">and the reason for that is that he could still... he still had the power of independent speech</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:19.600" style="s2">you remember, right at the beginning of the movie, when the mouth was painted on Pionokio</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.600" end="01:09:26.660" style="s2">we saw that mask that was really glaring at the process, I said that character recurrs continuously throughout the movie</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.660" end="01:09:32.200" style="s2">and this is a good example of that, because the Coachman is the enemy of anything that has it&#39;s own voice</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.200" end="01:09:38.600" style="s2">so he&#39;s the anti-Gepetto, that&#39;s a good way of thinking about it, he&#39;s the tyrannical aspect of the culture</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.600" end="01:09:44.900" style="s2">but insofar as one of these mostly donkeys, mostly jackasses can still talk</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.900" end="01:09:53.060" style="s2">then they&#39;re not completely fit for slavery; and you remember this movie was also being made at about the same time that</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.060" end="01:09:59.160" style="s2">the Nazi transformation of Germany was taking place, and so all these terrible ounderground things</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.160" end="01:10:06.500" style="s2">you know, this process whereby people were being reduced to ideological slaves, say</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.500" end="01:10:11.160" style="s2">and in this terrible process that was all playing out in Europe in a very big way</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.160" end="01:10:18.880" style="s2">It was not that people were not aware of that. It was in the air. So...</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.880" end="01:10:25.600" style="s2">Anyway, the donkeys and the jackass can still talk.</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.600" end="01:10:28.840" style="s2">Crying and complaining and repenting, and</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.840" end="01:10:33.060" style="s2">the Coachman turns into a  full tyrant again cracks a whip if I remember correctly,</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.060" end="01:10:35.980" style="s2">and says: &quot;You had your fun, and now you&#39;re gonna pay for it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.980" end="01:10:41.580" style="s2">The Cricket gets word of all this, he gets wind of it, he starts to understand what happened</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.580" end="01:10:46.500" style="s2">is that all these bad kids were enticed out onto this island so that they could be enslaved</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.500" end="01:10:50.360" style="s2">and he&#39;s really taken aback by that, to say the least</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.360" end="01:10:57.240" style="s2">when he realizes what&#39;s going on, so he runs back to find Pinokio, and then the scene switches back to the 8-ball bar where</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.240" end="01:11:03.400" style="s2">where Lampwick is drinking beer and complaining about what the conscience said</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.400" end="01:11:07.400" style="s2">you know, &#39;cause he&#39;s kinda guilty and ashamed, but he won&#39;t admit it, &#39;cause he doesn&#39;t admit anything</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.400" end="01:11:14.060" style="s2">he knows everything, he&#39;s not gonna admit anything about himself that isn&#39;t perfect, he&#39;s a real totalitarian in training</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.060" end="01:11:18.160" style="s2">and he drinks this beer, and he&#39;s laughing about the conscience and putting him down</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.160" end="01:11:22.340" style="s2">and then he says, well, what does he say exactly...?</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.340" end="01:11:26.500" style="s2">&quot;what does he think I am, a jackass?&quot; or something like that, maybe that&#39;s not the words exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.500" end="01:11:34.360" style="s2">and then he grows these ears, and Pinokio sees that and immediately takes a look at the beer and stops drinking it</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.360" end="01:11:40.240" style="s2">and then Lampwick transforms one more time, and his face turns into the face of a donkey</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.240" end="01:11:46.340" style="s2">and he&#39;s laughing still, and then his hands... oh yes, he laughs and then he starts to bray</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.340" end="01:11:53.680" style="s2">like a jackass, he&#39;s horrified by that, and then Pinokio laughs, and the braying comes out as well</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.680" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">so now they&#39;re absolutely horrified, and Lampwick actually figures out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:03.100" style="s2">he figures out that he&#39;s been tricked and that he&#39;s transforming and he&#39;s completely horrified by it</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.100" end="01:12:08.720" style="s2">he becomes conscious of what&#39;s happening to him; and there&#39;s one particularly, I would say, dramatic scene where</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.720" end="01:12:18.020" style="s2">his hands have transformed into hooves, and he&#39;s kicking and leaping around the room in panic</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.020" end="01:12:23.020" style="s2">and he comes up to a mirror, he sees himself as the jackass, and then he turns around and breaks the mirror</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.020" end="01:12:27.560" style="s2">so, you know, he&#39;s self-conscious for a moment, then he destroys his capacity for self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.560" end="01:12:32.520" style="s2">then he transforms entirely into a jackass, he&#39;s farther down the road than Pinokio [should be &#39;further&#39;]</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.520" end="01:12:37.760" style="s2">and he comes crawling to Pinokio to save him, and asks that the conscience comes back</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.760" end="01:12:41.260" style="s2">so that he can get out of this, but of course it&#39;s a bit too late, and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.260" end="01:12:45.860" style="s2">so then Pinokio grows jackass ears, and</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.860" end="01:12:49.980" style="s2">he&#39;s absolutely terrified by it as well, he knows what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.980" end="01:12:56.620" style="s2">and the cricket comes back, and guides him off Pleasure Island, and so then they end up on a cliff</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.620" end="01:13:01.460" style="s2">because this is an island, after all, and they have to jump into the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.460" end="01:13:08.360" style="s2">right, out of this impulsive, adolescent, hedonic playground into the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.360" end="01:13:13.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s how they escape; so that&#39;s the first time that Pinokio has to leave...</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.800" end="01:13:21.440" style="s2">this is the first scene where he has to jump into the water to make a clean break from something pathological</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">so tyranny... you see this echoed... you see echoes of this in the story of Moses leading his people from Egypt</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:34.580" style="s2">because Moses is a master of water, right? he hits a rock with a stick and water comes out of it</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.580" end="01:13:39.200" style="s2">and he&#39;s floating on water when he&#39;s an infant, and he parts the red sea, and</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.200" end="01:13:47.340" style="s2">so he&#39;s a master of water and transformation, and the pharaoh&#39;s kingdom is represented as desert stone, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.340" end="01:13:52.300" style="s2">and so, the idea there is that, well, the kingdom is solid ground</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.300" end="01:13:59.860" style="s2">but it can be a tyranny, and the water is chaos, but it can be the thing that you have to leap into to free yourself from the tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.860" end="01:14:07.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not like in the Moses story that that comes easy, right, because the Hebrews leave Egypt, which is a terrible tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.780" end="01:14:10.480" style="s2">and you think, well, that&#39;s good, they escaped from the tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.480" end="01:14:15.040" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what happens, they escape from the tyranny, they actually end up somewhere arguably worse</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.040" end="01:14:18.520" style="s2">&#39;cause they&#39;re wandering around in the desert for forty years</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.520" end="01:14:22.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s... it&#39;s a brilliant element of that story, because it states clearly that</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.880" end="01:14:28.020" style="s2">when you go from a bad place to a better place you go to a worse place first</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.020" end="01:14:31.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s a great... it&#39;s a great thing to know</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.200" end="01:14:35.800" style="s2">because it also tells you why you might be unwilling to take the next step</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.800" end="01:14:41.780" style="s2">you know, you&#39;re aiming up, but in order to aim up you have to let go of something you already have</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.780" end="01:14:43.940" style="s2">and then that will put you into a state of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.940" end="01:14:49.420" style="s2">and unless you&#39;re willing to undergo that intermediary state of chaos, and you might not recover from it</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.420" end="01:14:54.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get to the next level</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.480" end="01:14:58.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s rough, well, so Pinokio, he decides that chaos is better than tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.740" end="01:15:02.820" style="s2">and guided by his conscience</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.820" end="01:15:06.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t see anything happening in the water in this particular scene</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.080" end="01:15:13.540" style="s2">they come back to shore all half-drowned and exhausted by their adventure</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.540" end="01:15:22.120" style="s2">and they go back home, and I think maybe we&#39;ll take a break now, let&#39;s see, this is a good time to take a break</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.120" end="01:15:27.780" style="s2">1:30, perfect, so let&#39;s break for 15 minutes, okay? alright</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.780" end="01:15:37.540" style="s2">alright, so</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.540" end="01:15:45.220" style="s2">Carl Jung talked about this phenomenon he...</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.220" end="01:15:52.040" style="s2">he described as retrogressive restoration of the persona</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.040" end="01:15:59.820" style="s2">and so, it&#39;s a complicated idea, but basically what it means is that sometimes you take a leap forward</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.820" end="01:16:05.840" style="s2">and you learn some things, but you can&#39;t catalyze a new identity, so you try to go back and hide in your old identity</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.840" end="01:16:14.720" style="s2">and that actually doesn&#39;t work, because, well, things have changed, and you&#39;ve learned something, and that isn&#39;t who you are anymore</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.720" end="01:16:21.940" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like you have to cut parts of yourself off in a destructive manner to fit back into the person that you were</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.940" end="01:16:28.740" style="s2">now, what happens here is that Pinokio escapes from this tyrannical situation</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.740" end="01:16:34.080" style="s2">and undergoes this descent into chaos, but he tries to go back home, he tries to go back to what he was</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.080" end="01:16:42.220" style="s2">and he can&#39;t do that anymore, his father isn&#39;t at home anymore, and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.220" end="01:16:48.400" style="s2">so when he goes home he finds that there&#39;s no home there, now</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:52.660" style="s2">this happens to people sometimes, and it&#39;s often a shock to them, so</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.660" end="01:17:01.620" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve noticed about Peter Pan type... I&#39;m gonna speak about men here, because I&#39;ve observed it more in men</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.620" end="01:17:07.880" style="s2">is that they often stay under the thumb of their father, and you think, well</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.880" end="01:17:12.720" style="s2">why would someone do that, because it means they subject to the tyrannical judgment of their father</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.720" end="01:17:19.080" style="s2">they&#39;re always concerned about what their father would think or whether their father approves of them and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.080" end="01:17:26.760" style="s2">and you think, well, that&#39;s gotta be an unpleasant place to be, why would you do that?</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.760" end="01:17:31.700" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;ve suggested to my clients and to other people sometimes is that...</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.700" end="01:17:37.860" style="s2">here&#39;s a weird little exercise that you can undertake, a little thought experiment</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.860" end="01:17:42.900" style="s2">so you have your parents and of course your parents have friends who are about their age, and</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.900" end="01:17:48.660" style="s2">maybe some of them are people you only know peripherally, and I might ask you, well</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.660" end="01:17:55.040" style="s2">do you care more about what your parents think than you care about what these peripheral people who know your parents think?</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.040" end="01:18:01.520" style="s2">and then the answer to that is, well, of course, and then the question that arises out of that is:</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.520" end="01:18:04.120" style="s2">why?</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.120" end="01:18:09.480" style="s2">I mean, for someone else your parents are the peripheral people, and their parents are central, like</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.480" end="01:18:14.780" style="s2">why is it logical that your parents&#39; opinion makes any more difference to you</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.780" end="01:18:22.300" style="s2">than the opinion of some randomly selected people who are approximately that age</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.300" end="01:18:26.120" style="s2">why is it the case that you would consider that they know more than someone else?</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.120" end="01:18:31.120" style="s2">I mean, I know that they know you better, and fair enough, but that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.120" end="01:18:36.320" style="s2">and then another point there is that to the degree that your parents&#39; opinion about you matters more</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.320" end="01:18:41.920" style="s2">than some randomly selected people of approximately the same age, Jung would say, well</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.920" end="01:18:49.900" style="s2">you haven&#39;t exactly separated out the God-image from your parents, and so you&#39;re still under that combination</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.900" end="01:18:55.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like... it&#39;s a complicated thing to talk about, but think about the Harry Potter series</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.540" end="01:19:02.420" style="s2">Harry has two sets of parents, right, he&#39;s got the Dursley parents, and then he&#39;s got these, like, magical parents that sort of float behind</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.420" end="01:19:07.380" style="s2">and he should know the difference between them, they shouldn&#39;t be one and the same, they&#39;re not - for him</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.380" end="01:19:11.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like, well, you have your parents and you have nature and culture as parents</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.800" end="01:19:17.620" style="s2">and you shouldn&#39;t be thinking that your parents are nature and culture as well, they shouldn&#39;t have final dominion over you</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.620" end="01:19:20.500" style="s2">it means that you&#39;re not an individual yet if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.500" end="01:19:26.860" style="s2">Freud said for example that no one could be a man unless his father had died</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.860" end="01:19:31.100" style="s2">and Jung said yes, but that death can take place symbolically</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.100" end="01:19:36.240" style="s2">ok, so there&#39;s that part of the idea, and then another part of the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.240" end="01:19:40.580" style="s2">one of the times in your life when you actually realize that you&#39;re an individual</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.580" end="01:19:46.480" style="s2">is when you&#39;ll go and ask your parents something, and you&#39;ll realize they actually don&#39;t know any more about</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.480" end="01:19:50.580" style="s2">what you should do than you do, and that sucks</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.580" end="01:19:56.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly why people are often willing to maintain a tyrant-slave relationship with their father; it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.460" end="01:20:03.240" style="s2">on the one hand you have to be inferior in a relationship like that, you know, you&#39;ve always got the judge watching you</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.240" end="01:20:06.620" style="s2">but on the other hand there&#39;s always someone who knows what to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.620" end="01:20:11.580" style="s2">there&#39;s always someone standing between you and the unknown that you can go ask: what should I do?</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.580" end="01:20:18.100" style="s2">well, at some point you&#39;ll realize that the reason you can&#39;t ask that anymore is because they actually don&#39;t know any more than you do</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.100" end="01:20:21.860" style="s2">and then that&#39;s a pain, that is a symbolic death</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.860" end="01:20:26.380" style="s2">that&#39;s also when you establish a more individual relationship with your parents</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.380" end="01:20:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s at that point that you can conceivably start taking care of them instead of the reverse</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.020" end="01:20:35.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s a time that should come, but you have to let that image of perfection go</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.780" end="01:20:37.780" style="s2">and that exposes you</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.780" end="01:20:41.580" style="s2">well, that&#39;s what happens here, you know, Pinokio goes home</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.580" end="01:20:44.580" style="s2">and he wants things to be the way they were</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.580" end="01:20:48.840" style="s2">and he wants to stay under the careful care of the benevolent father</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.840" end="01:20:55.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s no longer possible, he&#39;s passed that point, and that&#39;s why the father has disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.240" end="01:21:01.260" style="s2">and so, Gepetto has gone off to look for Pinokio, because he also needs a son</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.260" end="01:21:04.380" style="s2">but in any case, the house is abandoned</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.380" end="01:21:10.820" style="s2">and so then we see inside the house that everything&#39;s covered in cobwebs, and everything&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.820" end="01:21:15.980" style="s2">and Pinokio and the Cricket sit on the steps and they&#39;re very concerned; first of all they wonder where he went</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.980" end="01:21:21.640" style="s2">so they&#39;re actually concerned that he&#39;s gone, but they also don&#39;t know what to do, because there&#39;s just no going home</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.640" end="01:21:27.700" style="s2">and so, you know, that&#39;s also the case that once you hit a certain point in your development...</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.700" end="01:21:34.000" style="s2">well, it&#39;s the same thing we already talked about, the answers that you are looking for are not going to be found in your parents&#39; house</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.000" end="01:21:40.460" style="s2">it&#39;s as simple as that, now you could artificially maintain your dependency, but, you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.460" end="01:21:46.060" style="s2">if you do that for too long, things get pretty ugly, so you get pretty stale, and</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.060" end="01:21:49.700" style="s2">you know, you&#39;re like bread that&#39;s been on the shelf for too long</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.700" end="01:21:53.220" style="s2">so, now they&#39;re wondering what to do, and where he could be</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.220" end="01:21:59.300" style="s2">and then something very strange happens, the star shows up again, and it turns into a dove</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.300" end="01:22:12.740" style="s2">and the dove flies down and puts a piece of paper bathed in light with gold writing on it in front of the Cricket and the puppet</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.740" end="01:22:18.140" style="s2">so what in the world is going on there? well, we know what the star is, we&#39;ve seen it multiple times, right</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.140" end="01:22:27.620" style="s2">it&#39;s also the place that the blue fairy came from, but it&#39;s this transcendent place, it&#39;s this place that occurs sort of as this ultimate ideal</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.620" end="01:22:35.860" style="s2">and this time it delivers a message; so what&#39;s happening here is that...</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.860" end="01:22:41.040" style="s2">Pinokio is fundamentally oriented by the wish that his father made so long ago, right?</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.040" end="01:22:47.740" style="s2">and the wish was that he would become a fully functioning individual; and so that&#39;s that transcendent place</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.740" end="01:22:53.160" style="s2">and Jung would say...</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.160" end="01:22:58.340" style="s2">when you orient your vision, different things appear to you in the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.340" end="01:23:04.900" style="s2">so, and I mean this literally, so, because you can&#39;t see everything -</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.900" end="01:23:11.580" style="s2">you vision calculates what&#39;s necessary, your brain calculates what&#39;s necessary for you to see so that you get to the point that you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.580" end="01:23:16.520" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean that metaphorically, I mean it literally</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.520" end="01:23:23.580" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t relevant to what you&#39;re seeking, you won&#39;t see them</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.580" end="01:23:31.360" style="s2">unless they get in your way, and they have to really block your pathway before they will be literally visible</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.360" end="01:23:40.280" style="s2">so you orient yourself towards something, and that makes some things visible that wouldn&#39;t be visible and makes others invisible that you might have seen</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.280" end="01:23:45.820" style="s2">and so when you change your orientation, what manifests itself in the world also changes</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.820" end="01:23:54.340" style="s2">now, Pinokio is in despair here, and he asks himself: where could my father have gone?</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.340" end="01:24:00.220" style="s2">and so, the question is: what exactly is he asking under those circumstances?</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.220" end="01:24:10.920" style="s2">and what he&#39;s asking is something like: I had a structure that was orienting me properly in relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.920" end="01:24:17.020" style="s2">and as far as it was embodied in my actual father it&#39;s now gone</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.020" end="01:24:21.660" style="s2">is there any possibility that I can find that again?</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.660" end="01:24:27.720" style="s2">and that is what you want, you see, like if you&#39;re in a chaotic circumstance, maybe you&#39;ve escaped, let&#39;s say, from a bad relationship</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.720" end="01:24:31.860" style="s2">or something like that, and you&#39;re out of it, but now you don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.860" end="01:24:37.580" style="s2">what you&#39;re hoping is that you can get your life back together, right?</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.580" end="01:24:41.120" style="s2">that you can put the pieces that have fallen apart back together</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.120" end="01:24:46.560" style="s2">and so you&#39;re automatically going to generate a fantasy about producing another, let&#39;s call it stable state</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.560" end="01:24:51.300" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be looking for the spirit that yould enable that state to be generated</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.300" end="01:24:55.320" style="s2">&#39;cause really what it is in some sense is your new personality</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.320" end="01:25:02.160" style="s2">you&#39;re in chaos, you have to become something new in order to get out of chaos, and so you&#39;re hoping for that, you&#39;re hoping that you&#39;ll see it</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.160" end="01:25:11.280" style="s2">and so, that&#39;s going to make certain things visible to you, that&#39;s the proper way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.280" end="01:25:16.820" style="s2">you know, when you get curious about something, maybe you&#39;re curious about something and you walk into a bookstore</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.820" end="01:25:20.720" style="s2">that curiosity is going to guide you to a certain set of books</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.720" end="01:25:26.060" style="s2">the fact that you have a question in mind is going to open your eyes to certain kinds of possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.060" end="01:25:32.600" style="s2">and so if your goal is to reestablish your union with the positive father, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.600" end="01:25:38.060" style="s2">then certain things are gonna appear, and other things aren&#39;t, and that&#39;s what this represents</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.060" end="01:25:43.280" style="s2">the transcendent star is the goal, which is this developmental process</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.280" end="01:25:49.400" style="s2">it&#39;s capable of, let&#39;s say, delivering a message to you; in some sense that&#39;s what&#39;s happening when you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.400" end="01:25:54.320" style="s2">you know, because you have a problem you wanna solve, you have somewhere you wanna go with your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.320" end="01:26:01.020" style="s2">and as a consequence of that information reveals itself to you in the interior landscape</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.020" end="01:26:06.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a very strange thing; you know, in some sense it feels as though you&#39;re producing the thoughts, but</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.200" end="01:26:11.140" style="s2">it could equally be said that you&#39;re watching the thoughts reveal themselves</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.140" end="01:26:17.100" style="s2">and which of those is more accurate is by no means obvious; you can certainly have thoughts that surprise you</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.100" end="01:26:21.840" style="s2">which is very strange, it&#39;s like,  they&#39;re your thoughts. How in the world can they surprise you, but they do</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.840" end="01:26:26.940" style="s2">so, it&#39;s like you didn&#39;t know them before you thought them up and then the question is well where did they come from</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.940" end="01:26:28.940" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t know them before you thought them up?</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.940" end="01:26:30.940" style="s2">Well, they sort of spring out of the void.</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.940" end="01:26:35.280" style="s2">That&#39;s one way of thinking about it. Anyways...</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.740" end="01:26:41.680" style="s2">this is a Holy Ghost symbol, this dove, as well, so that puts some Christian imagery in here again</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.380" end="01:26:48.240" style="s2">You could think of it as a manifestation of the spirit of transformation.</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.240" end="01:26:53.560" style="s2">That&#39;s another way of looking at it. Anyways, it&#39;s the conscience that interprets the letter</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.560" end="01:26:57.960" style="s2">figuring out what the next thing should be, and weirdly enough, what the letter says is that</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.960" end="01:27:04.060" style="s2">Geppetto was out looking for Pinocchio and he got swallowed by a whale</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.060" end="01:27:09.340" style="s2">which makes very little sense to put it bluntly</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.340" end="01:27:16.860" style="s2">Geppetto went to search for Pinocchio and now he&#39;s at the bottom of the sea in a giant whale.</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.860" end="01:27:22.560" style="s2">We leap right over that tremendous gap in logic</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.560" end="01:27:27.360" style="s2">and follow the story nonetheless. Okay, so what&#39;s the idea here?</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.360" end="01:27:32.660" style="s2">The idea is that if you fall into a chaotic state and everything falls apart...</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.500" end="01:27:41.880" style="s2">there&#39;s the possibility that things can come back together</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.880" end="01:27:47.340" style="s2">including what you&#39;ve just learned, in a new state.</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.340" end="01:27:52.580" style="s2">And  so you can conceptualize that symbolically as</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.580" end="01:27:58.040" style="s2">the existence of the dead father at the bottom of the chaotic landscape</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.040" end="01:28:01.960" style="s2">That&#39;s the proper way, as far as I can tell, to think about it.</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.960" end="01:28:07.280" style="s2">It&#39;s like there&#39;s something down there that&#39;s capable of re-forming and reemerging that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.280" end="01:28:12.340" style="s2">that incorporates the previous state but that takes it farther.</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.340" end="01:28:16.400" style="s2">And you&#39;re not going to find that unless you descend into this chaotic place where</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.400" end="01:28:18.960" style="s2">it feels like all order is gone.</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.960" end="01:28:22.320" style="s2">well, you generate order, it&#39;s going to be akin to the order that you had before</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.320" end="01:28:26.840" style="s2">but there&#39;s going to be something new about it as well, so it&#39;s down to the bottom of the chaotic state,</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.840" end="01:28:30.600" style="s2">to bring up what you&#39;re missing.</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.600" end="01:28:36.040" style="s2">And, that&#39;s one level of analysis. Another level of analysis you think is well that&#39;s also what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.040" end="01:28:40.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what you should be doing, in principle, when you&#39;re going to university</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.520" end="01:28:44.640" style="s2">You know, you&#39;re...you come to university</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.640" end="01:28:47.420" style="s2">in roughly the same state as Pinocchio.</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.420" end="01:28:51.580" style="s2">You know, you&#39;re a bit of a puppet, and you&#39;re kind of a jackass, and what the hell do you know?</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.580" end="01:28:55.360" style="s2">And it&#39;s chaotic because you haven&#39;t found your place in the world properly.</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.360" end="01:29:00.360" style="s2">And I don&#39;t mean merely for career, not that that&#39;s not relevant, because it is,</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.360" end="01:29:03.860" style="s2">but it&#39;s more important than that. It&#39;s because you&#39;re a historical creature.</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.860" end="01:29:07.960" style="s2">Because, you are a product of history, unless you</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.960" end="01:29:13.020" style="s2">are encultureated properly, which means you understand</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.020" end="01:29:18.600" style="s2">your past, in the sense that the humanities can allow for that, then</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.440" end="01:29:24.320" style="s2">you haven&#39;t been able to incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.320" end="01:29:29.100" style="s2">the wisdom of your ancestors into your day to day pursuits, and that&#39;s going to make you weak,</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.100" end="01:29:32.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea anyways. And so when you come to university,</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.580" end="01:29:38.420" style="s2">this is what university is for. It&#39;s so that you can go into the chaos,</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.420" end="01:29:42.340" style="s2">and you can pull something out of it that&#39;s truly of value.</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.340" end="01:29:46.480" style="s2">and you can incorporate that in your own personality, and that makes you much, much</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.480" end="01:29:51.200" style="s2">stronger, like literally stronger, not more educated, but</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.200" end="01:29:53.800" style="s2">not, it&#39;s not like you know more facts,</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.800" end="01:29:57.360" style="s2">it&#39;s that you literally are a better person, and &quot;better&quot; means</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.360" end="01:30:02.240" style="s2">you can do far more things. You can articulate your - that&#39;s something that&#39;s of crucial importance is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.240" end="01:30:04.900" style="s2">you can articulate yourself properly, which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.900" end="01:30:09.880" style="s2">more useful than anything else you can possibly manage, like if you guys come out of university</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.880" end="01:30:13.200" style="s2">capable of making coherent</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.200" end="01:30:16.180" style="s2">arguments, and using language properly,</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.180" end="01:30:22.900" style="s2">you&#39;re so powerful that it&#39;s ridiculous. You always</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.900" end="01:30:26.160" style="s2">you can lay out a strategy and pursue it successfully</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.160" end="01:30:30.660" style="s2">and maybe the strategy is oriented towards something good, something that will actually work</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.660" end="01:30:33.160" style="s2">work for you, and work for other people as well</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.160" end="01:30:37.900" style="s2">and I don&#39;t really understand why people aren&#39;t told this when they come to university, is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.900" end="01:30:46.820" style="s2">your goal is to make yourself as articulate in writing and thinking and speaking as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.820" end="01:30:52.960" style="s2">because that opens the door to everything that you&#39;ll wanna do in the future, no matter what it is</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.960" end="01:30:59.280" style="s2">the more articulate person always rises, always</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.280" end="01:31:08.220" style="s2">because they lay out strategies more effectively, they lay out the reasons for doing something or for not doing something</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.220" end="01:31:17.740" style="s2">more particularly; they convince people, and properly so, that they can grapple with potential that lies ahead</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.740" end="01:31:23.340" style="s2">effectively; and they can defend themselves when they&#39;re challenged</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.340" end="01:31:30.240" style="s2">and so, all of that is going into the past, into the chaos of the past, you could even say</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.240" end="01:31:35.700" style="s2">and pulling up the spirit that inhabits that from the bottom and uniting with it</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.700" end="01:31:45.560" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t do that, well, you&#39;re defenceless in the case of... in the face of the tragedy of life</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.560" end="01:31:52.020" style="s2">and then, that&#39;s not so good, because if you&#39;re defenceless in the face of the tragedy of life</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.020" end="01:31:56.800" style="s2">then you get way more hurt than you would otherwise get, and so will the people around you; and then</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.800" end="01:32:01.380" style="s2">the probability that you&#39;re gonna be resentful and bitter about that is really high, because</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.380" end="01:32:07.240" style="s2">no one likes to fail continually; and then you get bitter and resentful</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.240" end="01:32:13.280" style="s2">and then once you&#39;re bitter and resentful, well, being vengeful and mean is the next step</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.280" end="01:32:18.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take much of a transformation to move from that place to the next</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.840" end="01:32:24.700" style="s2">so now Pinokio has to face the thing that he&#39;s afraid of most</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.700" end="01:32:31.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s a complicated idea as well; so Jung had this</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.340" end="01:32:36.480" style="s2">phrase that he took from the alchemists, which was &quot;in sterqualinas invenetur&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.480" end="01:32:42.080" style="s2">and what it meant was: &quot;what you most wanna find will be found where you least wanna look&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.080" end="01:32:46.900" style="s2">there&#39;s this old story that&#39;s from King Arthur, and King Arthur has these knights, right</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.900" end="01:32:51.300" style="s2">they all sit around the Round Table, which means they&#39;re roughly equal, that&#39;s what the round table means</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.300" end="01:32:56.600" style="s2">and they&#39;re off to find the Holy Grail, and the Holy Grail is the most valuable object, that&#39;s what it means</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.600" end="01:33:01.380" style="s2">so they&#39;re off to find the most valuable thing, but they don&#39;t know what it is, and they don&#39;t know where it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.380" end="01:33:06.920" style="s2">but they know that there&#39;s a most valuable thing, so in osme sense it&#39;s akin to them orienting themselves by the star</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.920" end="01:33:12.120" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know where to look, and so what they decide is</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.120" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">they have the castle and it&#39;s in the middle of a forest; so each knight decides to start looking for the Holy Grail</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:22.220" style="s2">by entering the forest at the point that looks darkest to him</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.220" end="01:33:27.060" style="s2">and so what&#39;s the idea there?</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.060" end="01:33:32.240" style="s2">well, imagine there are things that come easy to you and that you&#39;re fond of pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.240" end="01:33:36.680" style="s2">and that you&#39;re happy about pursuing; so you&#39;ve found them and pursued them</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.680" end="01:33:43.420" style="s2">and you&#39;ve mastered them, so you know all that; but then there&#39;s another place that you don&#39;t wanna go</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.420" end="01:33:46.920" style="s2">and so you haven&#39;t gone there and you haven&#39;t mastered it, and</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.920" end="01:33:52.960" style="s2">you&#39;re very small in comparison to it, because you haven&#39;t mastered it, and so it has this monstrous aspect</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.960" end="01:33:57.040" style="s2">...</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.040" end="01:34:03.640" style="s2">but if what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t working, it&#39;s where you haven&#39;t gone that you need to go</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.640" end="01:34:07.380" style="s2">and so, I can give you another example of this, so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.380" end="01:34:13.500" style="s2">you&#39;re an agreeable person, and so you don&#39;t like conflict and you won&#39;t stand up for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.500" end="01:34:21.280" style="s2">and you regard anger and the proclivity to provoke and to engage in conflict as something that&#39;s positively terrible</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.280" end="01:34:25.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that you&#39;re not good at it, it&#39;s actually that it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.780" end="01:34:29.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s where you have to go if you&#39;re gonna learn how to stand up for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.440" end="01:34:33.760" style="s2">and imagine that you&#39;re afraid, maybe you have something like agoraphobia</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.760" end="01:34:38.300" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole bunch of things that you&#39;re afraid of, and you don&#39;t wanna go there</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.300" end="01:34:42.340" style="s2">but if you wanna put yourself together, then that&#39;s exactly where you have to go</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.340" end="01:34:51.100" style="s2">and so it&#39;s frequently the case that what you wanna find is to be found where you least wanna find it</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.100" end="01:34:57.560" style="s2">and that idea&#39;s echoed in the prominent stories of dragons and gold</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.560" end="01:35:05.320" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly the same idea, is that the dragon is this terrible thing, it&#39;s this terrible predatory thing that lives forever and is very, very wise</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.320" end="01:35:10.520" style="s2">and lives underground, and it&#39;ll kill you, it&#39;ll burn you up in a second</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.520" end="01:35:16.860" style="s2">but it hoards gold; and so you have to go there, into the dragon&#39;s lair if you&#39;re gonna get the gold</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.860" end="01:35:22.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s a representation of peoples&#39; paradoxical relationship with reliaty, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.160" end="01:35:27.220" style="s2">you have to go out there and confront it in order to incorporate what it has to offer to you</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.220" end="01:35:33.380" style="s2">but the probability that that&#39;s going to be intensely dangerous and push you right to the limit...</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.380" end="01:35:40.360" style="s2">first of all, those are actually the same thing; if it didn&#39;t push you to the limit, you wouldn&#39;t gain anything valuable from it</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.360" end="01:35:45.400" style="s2">so you don&#39;t get one without the other, you don&#39;t get the gold without the dragon</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.400" end="01:35:51.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strange, very very strange idea, but it seems to be accurate</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.180" end="01:35:56.280" style="s2">so all of that&#39;s lurking underneath this in this imagery of the whale</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.280" end="01:36:03.080" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s at the bottom of... now, the whale, you can think of the story of Jonah</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.080" end="01:36:09.040" style="s2">what happens with Jonah is that, roughly speaking, he is a prophet</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.040" end="01:36:15.160" style="s2">and God tells him that he has to, if I rmember correctly, God tells him that he has to go to this city, and</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.160" end="01:36:21.400" style="s2">straighten it out, because it&#39;s veered off the path and it&#39;s heading towards doom, and</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.400" end="01:36:27.140" style="s2">Jonah thinks: I&#39;m not going to that city to tell those people anything like that, because they&#39;re not gonna be very happy</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.140" end="01:36:31.300" style="s2">with me just showing up there and telling them, you know, everything they&#39;re doing is wrong, and so</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.300" end="01:36:39.040" style="s2">he hops on a boat and tries to get out of there, and then God conjures up this huge storm, and the boat is about to be swamped</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.040" end="01:36:45.240" style="s2">and the sailors, they&#39;re worried, I think, about making the boat lighter, something like that</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.240" end="01:36:51.060" style="s2">they all draw lots to see who gets tossed overboard, and Jonah admits that it&#39;s actually his fault</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.060" end="01:36:56.880" style="s2">because God&#39;s upset with him, because he got this direct command to go straighten out this city and he ran off, and so</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.880" end="01:37:01.840" style="s2">the sailors throw... they&#39;re not happy about this, but they throw Jonah overboard, and the seas calm</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.840" end="01:37:06.080" style="s2">and a great fish comes up, a whale, and swallows him, and then he&#39;s down in the fish for three days</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.080" end="01:37:11.880" style="s2">and it throws him up on the dry land, and then he&#39;s learned his lesson by that time, and he goes off to have this...</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.880" end="01:37:19.260" style="s2">to pursue his proper destiny; so that&#39;s echoed in this story as well</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.260" end="01:37:25.560" style="s2">that if you don&#39;t follow the pathway that you&#39;re supposed to follow</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.560" end="01:37:31.960" style="s2">the seas will become stormy for you, and something will come up and pull you down</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.960" end="01:37:36.100" style="s2">and you&#39;ll be in a terrible place for some length of time, &#39;till you learn your lesson</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.100" end="01:37:41.700" style="s2">and if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll get spit back up on shore, and then you can go do what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.700" end="01:37:48.160" style="s2">well, I mean that&#39;s not a lesson that anybody needs to have interpreted, I think everybody understands that</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.160" end="01:37:54.340" style="s2">anyways, the Cricket tells Pinokio what he has to do</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.340" end="01:37:59.120" style="s2">and then something kind of paradoxical happens, Pinokio decides he&#39;s gonna go do this</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.120" end="01:38:04.320" style="s2">and then the Cricket has got this weird, paradoxical response to that; on the one hand he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.320" end="01:38:09.800" style="s2">he&#39;s sort of pulling Pinokio back, saying: look, you know, this is foolhardy</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.800" end="01:38:14.760" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna go all the way down to the ocean, you&#39;re gonna confront this terrible whale, this is really, really dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.760" end="01:38:22.180" style="s2">but at the same time, when Pinokio&#39;s on the edge of the cliff, the Cricket helps him tie his tail around a rock</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.180" end="01:38:29.140" style="s2">and he holds his finger in place, so that Pinokio can tie the knot, it&#39;s like the conscience is conflicted about this</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.140" end="01:38:34.120" style="s2">really dangerous and foolhardy, but it&#39;s also necessary, and so he plays this dual role</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.120" end="01:38:41.540" style="s2">and Pinokio&#39;s leading at this point; so into the ocean he goes</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.540" end="01:38:48.040" style="s2">I guess partly what this means is that if you&#39;re not oriented properly in the world, you should take your...</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.040" end="01:38:52.080" style="s2">you should take your doubts and the chaos that you&#39;re enveloped in seriously</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.080" end="01:38:55.780" style="s2">you should face it and think it through, you should go into it as far as you can go into it</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.780" end="01:39:04.380" style="s2">because you&#39;ll find something at the bottom of it; the alternative is to pretend that it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.380" end="01:39:12.240" style="s2">so then Pinokio is at the bottom of the water; he can actually breathe down there, it turns out, so</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.240" end="01:39:16.780" style="s2">you could think that he&#39;s gone into the unknown, he&#39;s outside of dry land,</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.780" end="01:39:22.400" style="s2">he&#39;s in the unconscious, all of those things are true, and</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.400" end="01:39:28.880" style="s2">you might think, well, why would it be the world outside of what&#39;s known and the unconscious at the same time?</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.880" end="01:39:34.460" style="s2">this weird intermingling of those two things; and as far as I can tell, that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.460" end="01:39:39.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re in chaos and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, then you start imagining what might be going on</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.880" end="01:39:44.120" style="s2">and that imagination is partly the world as it might be</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.120" end="01:39:49.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s also partly the structure of your unconscious mind, which is producing the fantasies, and so</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.800" end="01:39:54.420" style="s2">when you&#39;re truly in chaos, then the distinction between your fantasies and reality isn&#39;t clear</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.420" end="01:39:59.640" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what constitutes the chaos; so imagine this, so</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.640" end="01:40:03.400" style="s2">you&#39;re in a relationship, and the person betrays you</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.400" end="01:40:07.620" style="s2">and you knew who they were, at least you thought you did, before that moment</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.620" end="01:40:12.200" style="s2">but now you&#39;re looking at them and you don&#39;t know who they are</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.200" end="01:40:15.820" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know what the past was, and you don&#39;t know what the present is</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.820" end="01:40:20.520" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know what the future&#39;s going to be; all of that&#39;s been thrown up into the air in a major way</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.520" end="01:40:24.620" style="s2">that&#39;s traumatic, so much has fallen apart that it&#39;s traumatic</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.620" end="01:40:29.780" style="s2">so what do you start to do? you start to imagine what might be the situation</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.780" end="01:40:34.600" style="s2">well, then the reality, like, the reality is the reality and your imagination at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.600" end="01:40:42.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not pulled apart at all, you cannot distinguish between them, and so</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.160" end="01:40:48.680" style="s2">it was a Jungian idea... I could say that&#39;s the snitch that Harry Potter&#39;s chasing, by the way</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.680" end="01:40:56.420" style="s2">I know that&#39;s a terrible leap, but that is what it is, it&#39;s that weird intermingling of potential and reality that</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.420" end="01:41:03.500" style="s2">that can manifest itself as the world if you pursue it, it&#39;s roughly that</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.500" end="01:41:09.300" style="s2">so Pinokio&#39;s in this situation that&#39;s half-fantasy and half-reality, in this chaotic state</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.300" end="01:41:13.080" style="s2">and he has to go down to find the thing that he least wants to find</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.080" end="01:41:20.420" style="s2">and he&#39;s hoping that it... he&#39;s got this intuition that in facing that thing, that chaos that life really is, that chaos</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.420" end="01:41:28.460" style="s2">that he&#39;s going to find his father and reunite with him</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.460" end="01:41:35.340" style="s2">so you could also say that in some sense it&#39;s a decision of faith, i suppose, because</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.340" end="01:41:43.020" style="s2">you might ask yourself, well, why bother confronting chaos? if chaos is the ultimate reality, then what the hell use is facing it?</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.020" end="01:41:47.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s just gonna reveal itself as the ultimate reality and drown you</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.260" end="01:41:52.000" style="s2">but the myths always say the same thing, they say: &quot;no, no, if you confront what&#39;s really disturbing you</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.000" end="01:41:56.740" style="s2">if you really confront it, and you do it voluntarily, you&#39;re gonna find order in it eventually&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.740" end="01:41:59.380" style="s2">or at least that&#39;s the only way you&#39;re gonna find order</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.380" end="01:42:05.160" style="s2">now, it&#39;s not like these stories are optimistic, and it&#39;s not as if they give you a sure guide to success</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.160" end="01:42:09.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing, it&#39;s not like they&#39;re unerringly accurate, because</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.180" end="01:42:17.100" style="s2">you can be subsumed by chaos that&#39;s so total that even if you face it, you&#39;re not gonna prevail</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.100" end="01:42:21.980" style="s2">I mean, that&#39;s why people die, that&#39;s one way of looking at it anyways</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.980" end="01:42:25.700" style="s2">but the mythology basically says that this is your best bet</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.700" end="01:42:30.600" style="s2">if there&#39;s a process that&#39;s going to work, this is it</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.600" end="01:42:35.740" style="s2">and so, and then you might think, well, the better you do it, the better the chances are of success</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.740" end="01:42:39.860" style="s2">or the more consistently you do it, the better the chances of success are</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.860" end="01:42:42.400" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.400" end="01:42:45.960" style="s2">ok, so anyways, Pinokio&#39;s down at the bottom of the ocean</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.960" end="01:42:51.320" style="s2">and every time he says... he&#39;s trying  to find out where Monstro is</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.320" end="01:42:58.020" style="s2">and they ask questions to the fish down there, but every time they mention Monstro&#39;s name, all the fish disappear</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.020" end="01:43:02.040" style="s2">that&#39;s like Voldemort, right? he&#39;s the guy whose name you cannot say</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.040" end="01:43:08.640" style="s2">and Monstro is precisely that, it&#39;s the thing that frightens everyone, and so</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.640" end="01:43:16.480" style="s2">asking questions down there isn&#39;t helping very much, and so Pinokio, what he does is he&#39;s calling for his father, and he keeps going deeper and deeper into the depths</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.480" end="01:43:21.700" style="s2">and there&#39;s a scene where</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.700" end="01:43:27.320" style="s2">the darkness of the ocean turns into an even more profound darkness, and that&#39;s what Pinokio disappears into</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.320" end="01:43:34.680" style="s2">and then we see Monstro, he&#39;s in this sort of foggy representation, this huge thing that lies very much at the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.680" end="01:43:40.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s no life or anything around him except, I think these are mackerel, but maybe they&#39;re tuna</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.940" end="01:43:43.700" style="s2">they&#39;re animated anyway, so it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.700" end="01:43:49.100" style="s2">but there&#39;s no life down there, he&#39;s so far down at the bottom of the ocean that there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s alive down there</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.100" end="01:43:53.180" style="s2">so, and then we go inside the whale, which is, of course, abzurd</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.180" end="01:43:58.220" style="s2">we see that the whale has eaten a boat at some point in the past, this is one whopping whale</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.220" end="01:44:02.080" style="s2">and Gepetto is sitting with the kitten, of all things,</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.080" end="01:44:06.880" style="s2">he&#39;s also got that litte goldfish bowl full of goldfish with him too, which is quite the feat</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.880" end="01:44:13.140" style="s2">anyways, he&#39;s sitting there and he knows that he&#39;s trapped in the belly of the whale too, and that he can&#39;t get out</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.140" end="01:44:19.320" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an interesting issue, because it&#39;s not only Pinokio is lacking his father, which isn&#39;t a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.320" end="01:44:26.000" style="s2">but the father is lacking the son, and there&#39;s some indication that the father can&#39;t get out of the whale without the son</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.000" end="01:44:31.860" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like the possibility for order is down there in this chaotic state</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.860" end="01:44:39.000" style="s2">but unless there&#39;s an active agent to go seek it out, it can&#39;t pull itself... it&#39;s not animated enough to get out by itself</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.000" end="01:44:42.980" style="s2">you know, and you could say, well, there&#39;s wisdom in the libraries, but it&#39;s not going to..</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.980" end="01:44:51.060" style="s2">without you going in there and gathering it, and embodying it, all it does is sit there in potential in all of that...</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.060" end="01:44:54.520" style="s2">imlicit form, that&#39;s a good way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.520" end="01:44:58.160" style="s2">so anyways, Gepetto is feeling pretty hopeless</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.160" end="01:45:02.180" style="s2">because he can&#39;t figure out any way of getting out of the whale, and he&#39;s also starving</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.180" end="01:45:06.300" style="s2">he&#39;s starving in the belly of the whale</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.300" end="01:45:13.180" style="s2">here&#39;s a way of thinking about that:</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.180" end="01:45:16.900" style="s2">Gepetto&#39;s a good guy, but he&#39;s old</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.900" end="01:45:21.920" style="s2">and that means his way of doing things is no longer fruitful, that&#39;s why he&#39;s starving</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.920" end="01:45:25.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s especially not fruitful, &#39;cause he&#39;s missing his son</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.640" end="01:45:31.640" style="s2">he&#39;s missing the active element that the child represents, say, the playful and transformative element that the child represents</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.640" end="01:45:36.560" style="s2">and so, if you get stuck doing something the same old way, at some point it&#39;s no longer going to work</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.560" end="01:45:39.960" style="s2">even if it was good at some point; it has to be updated</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.960" end="01:45:45.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s updated by, let&#39;s call it the spirit of youth, or the spirit of attention, or the spirit of play, something like that</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.720" end="01:45:51.700" style="s2">the willingness to break boundaries and take risks; and Gepetto is very, very skilled, but</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.700" end="01:45:55.460" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t have that, and that&#39;s symbolized by the loss of his son</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.460" end="01:46:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why he was out looking for his son too, he needs him; and so, they&#39;re in despair down there</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.880" end="01:46:04.880" style="s2">trying to fish and not getting anything, and so...</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.880" end="01:46:08.700" style="s2">Monstro wakes up</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.700" end="01:46:13.900" style="s2">a mackerel happens to swim by and Monstro wakes up, and so...</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.900" end="01:46:17.780" style="s2">I think they&#39;re tuna, actually, they look like tuna to me</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.780" end="01:46:23.160" style="s2">and so, Monstro wakes up and he opens his mouth, and a bunch of water starts to come in</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.160" end="01:46:30.740" style="s2">and so, and then you see Pinokio with the fish, now...</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.740" end="01:46:35.660" style="s2">there&#39;s very intense implicit Christian symbolism in this part of the film</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.660" end="01:46:39.400" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna lay it out point by point, so</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.400" end="01:46:43.000" style="s2">you may remember and perhaps you don&#39;t, and perhaps you don&#39;t know, that</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.000" end="01:46:46.680" style="s2">one of the symbols for Christ is a fish, ichthys, right?</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.680" end="01:46:52.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s a play on the Greek representation of Christ&#39;s name, buyt there&#39;s more to it than that, because</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.000" end="01:46:55.100" style="s2">all of Christ&#39;s followers are fishermen</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.100" end="01:46:59.100" style="s2">and he performs a bunch of miracles with fish; and fish are strange things</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.100" end="01:47:02.540" style="s2">because, well, you can pull then up out of the depths, that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.540" end="01:47:08.100" style="s2">and so they&#39;re things that can be pulled out of the depth; and you could say that...</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.100" end="01:47:14.300" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be very difficult for me to take this apart, but you can say in some sense that Christ is a meta-fish</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.300" end="01:47:18.780" style="s2">a fish is something that you can dine on</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.780" end="01:47:25.420" style="s2">but a way of being is something that provides you with something to dine on on a continual basis</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.420" end="01:47:30.500" style="s2">and so, you might say, well, is it better to have a fish or to be a fisherman?</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.500" end="01:47:35.480" style="s2">that&#39;s another way of thinking about it, and obviously it&#39;s better to be a fisherman, because then you can get more fish</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.480" end="01:47:43.440" style="s2">and so, it&#39;s one thing to have something, but it&#39;s another thing completely to know how to generate good things</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.440" end="01:47:48.040" style="s2">and so, if you had any sense, you&#39;d take the latter over the former</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.040" end="01:47:53.700" style="s2">even though the former is more instantaneously gratifying and requires less work and responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.700" end="01:47:58.820" style="s2">and so, anyways, the whale opens his mouth and goes chasing these fish</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.820" end="01:48:03.420" style="s2">and Pinokio tries... he&#39;s trying to get the hell out of there, even though he wants to find the whale</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.420" end="01:48:05.800" style="s2">when he actually sees the whale, he leaves</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.800" end="01:48:13.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s also a very common mythological, umm, what would you call it? plot element</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.320" end="01:48:18.260" style="s2">it&#39;s very frequently that what happens when the hero first sees the terrible thing, the dragon, say</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.260" end="01:48:22.400" style="s2">the terrible thing that he&#39;s come to conquer he freezes and gets the hell out of there, because</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.400" end="01:48:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s far worse than he thought it was going to be; and so Pinokio is like: no way, man</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.520" end="01:48:33.480" style="s2">I&#39;m not going near that whale; and away he swims, and he&#39;s actually at the forefront of all the fish, which is quite interesting too</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.480" end="01:48:41.320" style="s2">so, in the mean time Monstro has opened his mouth, and the fish are pouring in, and Gepetto is fishing like mad, and he&#39;s catching fish</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.320" end="01:48:45.420" style="s2">like crazy; and so, the little cat is...</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.420" end="01:48:49.340" style="s2">Gepetto is flinging the fish backwards into this, like, box</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.340" end="01:48:54.960" style="s2">and the little cat is there, whacking them to kill them while they&#39;re flopping around</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.960" end="01:49:00.800" style="s2">and so they&#39;re pretty excited about this, because... they have a problem, the problem is how to get out of the whale</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.800" end="01:49:06.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the actual problem; but a nested problem inside that is how not to starve to death</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.080" end="01:49:11.920" style="s2">and so, Gepetto&#39;s pretty happy that even though he&#39;s not getting out of the whale, that he gets to have something to eat</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.920" end="01:49:16.000" style="s2">so you could say as well, that he&#39;s not exactly focused on the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.000" end="01:49:20.940" style="s2">he&#39;s focused on the micro-problem instead of the macro-problem, and that makes him kind of blind</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.940" end="01:49:27.180" style="s2">so anyways, the whale swallows up Pinokio, and</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.180" end="01:49:31.700" style="s2">Gepetto keeps fishing; and then he snags Pinokio</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.700" end="01:49:37.600" style="s2">now this is cool, because... and this is another example of that meta-fish idea</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.600" end="01:49:44.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like... Gepetto&#39;s actually looking not for a fish, he&#39;s looking for a way out of the damn whale</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.120" end="01:49:47.880" style="s2">and then he catches a bunch of fish, and he&#39;s like focused on that like mad</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.880" end="01:49:52.360" style="s2">and then he catches Pinokio, and Pinokio represents what would get him out of the whale</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.360" end="01:49:56.260" style="s2">but he&#39;s so bloody obsessed with the fish tha he doesn&#39;t even notice</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.260" end="01:49:59.240" style="s2">so he catches Pinokio and flings him into the fish basket</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.240" end="01:50:04.100" style="s2">and so, it signifies the blindness of Gepetto&#39;s orientation</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.100" end="01:50:11.540" style="s2">when he&#39;s inside the whale, that&#39;s kind of a comment on his aged and insufficient nature</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.540" end="01:50:15.640" style="s2">he&#39;s solving the wrong... he&#39;s solving the problem very well, but it&#39;s the wrong problem</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.640" end="01:50:19.940" style="s2">so anyways, he fires Pinokio into the fish bin, and</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.940" end="01:50:28.780" style="s2">Pinokio says: Father! I&#39;m here; and Gepetto says: Don&#39;t bother me right now, Pinokio, I&#39;m busy fishing</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.780" end="01:50:34.580" style="s2">well then, that&#39;s fine, so then he kinda wakes up, he has this little moment of insight, this little revelation, that</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.580" end="01:50:39.780" style="s2">well, he&#39;s caught Pinokio, so who cares about the damn fish; so then he runs over to the fish box to grab Pinokio</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.780" end="01:50:42.700" style="s2">and instead he grabs a fish, and gives it a kiss</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.700" end="01:50:45.600" style="s2">and so that is another way of hammering home the fact that he&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.600" end="01:50:48.380" style="s2">there&#39;s this confusion that he&#39;s suffering from</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.380" end="01:50:53.820" style="s2">he can&#39;t distinguish the local truth from the transcendent truth</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.820" end="01:50:58.860" style="s2">and so anyways, he does figure it out; he tosses the fish aside and he grabs Pinokio</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.860" end="01:51:02.920" style="s2">they&#39;re all thriled to death to see each other, and so they&#39;re united</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.920" end="01:51:07.500" style="s2">so Pinokio has found his father, but they&#39;re still trapped in the belly of the whale; now</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.500" end="01:51:12.200" style="s2">Pinokio takes off his hat, he gets covered with a blanket, he takes off his hat, and</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.200" end="01:51:15.440" style="s2">he reveals his jackass ears, and so</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.440" end="01:51:21.420" style="s2">he&#39;s found his father, but he&#39;s damaged, and not... Pinokio, he&#39;s damaged and not in good shape</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.420" end="01:51:27.980" style="s2">he isn&#39;t becoming what he was supposed to be; in fact, he&#39;s actually degenerated since Gepetto saw him last</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.980" end="01:51:31.700" style="s2">and so, he becomes embarrassed, and he says he has a tail</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.700" end="01:51:35.840" style="s2">he says: that&#39;s nothing, I have a tail too, and then he spins that around kinda laughing</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.840" end="01:51:40.040" style="s2">and he brays and gets really embarrassed, and so, that&#39;s what you see here, he looks like, well...</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.040" end="01:51:44.220" style="s2">he&#39;s revealed himself as a jackass to his father</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.220" end="01:51:50.040" style="s2">but you know, that&#39;s actually a good thing, because...</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.040" end="01:51:58.680" style="s2">he is a jackass, and if he was unwilling to admit his insufficiency</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.680" end="01:52:06.840" style="s2">he wouldn&#39;t have ever gone on this pursuit, so...</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.840" end="01:52:13.060" style="s2">it&#39;s this perverse willingness to note that he isn&#39;t all that he could be</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.060" end="01:52:17.220" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what drives him to find everything that his father represents</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.220" end="01:52:22.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a humility, and it&#39;s an admission of insufficiency</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.840" end="01:52:27.560" style="s2">and you need that before you&#39;re going to learn anything, because before you learn anything you have to</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.560" end="01:52:32.480" style="s2">admit that there are things that are important that you don&#39;t know, and that you&#39;re a fool</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.480" end="01:52:35.360" style="s2">and maybe that you&#39;re a braying jackass</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.360" end="01:52:39.980" style="s2">and so, that&#39;s why there are injunctions in many religious in many religious writings</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.980" end="01:52:45.380" style="s2">that positively portray humility, as the antidote to arrogance</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.380" end="01:52:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way of thinking about it, is that humility means: I still have something to learn</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.120" end="01:52:53.760" style="s2">I&#39;m insufficient, I still have something to learn</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.760" end="01:52:57.220" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly the opposite, say of Lampwick&#39;s attitude</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.220" end="01:53:03.800" style="s2">anyways, Gepetto decides that son puppet who&#39;s half-jackass is better than no son at all</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.800" end="01:53:08.560" style="s2">which is another indication of his relatively positive orientation towards the world</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.560" end="01:53:11.460" style="s2">and they reunite; and then</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.460" end="01:53:17.260" style="s2">Pinokio immediately sets his eyes on the main problem, it&#39;s like: hey, we&#39;re stuck in this whale, we need to get out of here!</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.260" end="01:53:22.100" style="s2">and it turns out that Geppetto has already built a raft, but there&#39;s a problem, and the problem is that</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.100" end="01:53:26.600" style="s2">as Gepetto says... Pinokio says: well, we&#39;ll wait for his mouth to open</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.600" end="01:53:33.480" style="s2">and Gepetto says: that doesn&#39;t work, because when he opens his mouth, Monstro opens his mouth, everything comes in, and nothing goes out</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.480" end="01:53:36.800" style="s2">so, raft - fine, but there&#39;s no way of using it</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.800" end="01:53:41.360" style="s2">and so, Gepetto decides that they&#39;re not going to bother with that problem</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.360" end="01:53:44.840" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna go have some fish</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.840" end="01:53:49.740" style="s2">but Pinokio, his eyes is still on the main prize, he thinks: no way, man, we&#39;re getting out of this whale</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.740" end="01:53:54.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the fundamental think, we&#39;re not going to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.480" end="01:53:59.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to attend to the fact that it&#39;s sinking, we&#39;re gonna keep our eye on the primary problem</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.200" end="01:54:02.920" style="s2">so he&#39;s a little more awake by now; so Pinokio says:</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.920" end="01:54:06.900" style="s2">we&#39;ll make a fire; now that&#39;s cool, I think, because</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.900" end="01:54:11.600" style="s2">he&#39;s down in chaos, where his father is trapped, and the first thing he does is to use fire</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.600" end="01:54:15.700" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s exactly what people do, right, &#39;cause we&#39;re fire-users; and so</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.700" end="01:54:22.840" style="s2">and shaman, for example, are masters of fire; but there&#39;s this really primordial element to this story right here, and</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.840" end="01:54:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s an indication that the thing that can transform chaos into productive order</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.720" end="01:54:33.200" style="s2">is also the same spirit that mastered fire</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.200" end="01:54:37.080" style="s2">and so, Pinokio lays that out; and he says: we&#39;re gonna build a fire!</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.080" end="01:54:41.160" style="s2">and we&#39;ll fill him up with smoke!</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.160" end="01:54:45.040" style="s2">and Gepetto says: great, smoked fish!</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.040" end="01:54:47.420" style="s2">so he&#39;s still stuck on this whole fish thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.420" end="01:54:52.260" style="s2">and so Pinokio runs around gathering up all the spare wood on the boat</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.260" end="01:54:55.900" style="s2">including the furniture, which he starts to break; and Gepetto says:</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.900" end="01:54:59.020" style="s2">well, what are we going to sit on? you know, while we eat our smoked fish</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.020" end="01:55:04.900" style="s2">and Pinokio basically says, politely: you know, enough with the damn fish thing</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.900" end="01:55:11.280" style="s2">I&#39;m going to fill the whale with smoke, and that&#39;s gonna make him sneeze, and then we can get the hell out of here</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.280" end="01:55:16.900" style="s2">and Gepetto says: that&#39;s gonna make him mad, it&#39;s not a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.900" end="01:55:24.060" style="s2">and, well, I would say that that&#39;s the stance of the benevolent state against innovation</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.060" end="01:55:28.460" style="s2">you know, even if the innovation is positive, and even if it&#39;s transformative and freeing</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.460" end="01:55:32.480" style="s2">the old state, even if it&#39;s good, it&#39;s going to stand in opposition to that</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.480" end="01:55:36.680" style="s2">and so that&#39;s also something that&#39;s very useful to know, because otherwise you can get bitter about that</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.680" end="01:55:40.380" style="s2">anyways, Pinokio makes this big fire, Gepetto&#39;s pretty worried about it</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.380" end="01:55:45.620" style="s2">and he starts to fill the whale up with smoke; and so this is where the whale turns into a fire-breathing dragon</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.620" end="01:55:52.860" style="s2">which is quite cool, it&#39;s like in Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent turns into a fire-spewing dragon as well</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.860" end="01:55:57.880" style="s2">and if you watch the Little Mermaid, that... what&#39;s her name? Ursula</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.880" end="01:56:03.020" style="s2">she turns into a gigantic snake-like creature as well, although she doesn&#39;t exactly spew fire</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.020" end="01:56:10.040" style="s2">but the transformation of the ultimate monster into something like a dragon is very, very common</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.040" end="01:56:14.780" style="s2">&#39;cause it&#39;s the ultimate symbol of the unknown for a variety of reasons that we&#39;ll dusciss later</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.780" end="01:56:21.660" style="s2">so anyways... yes, it&#39;s a symbol of chaos</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.660" end="01:56:27.200" style="s2">anyways, and this is quite a horrifying scene; when my son watched, and he watched Pinokio when he was about 4</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.200" end="01:56:32.660" style="s2">he watched this scene over, and over, and over; I don&#39;t know how many times he watched that movie, but it must&#39;ve been a hundred times</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.660" end="01:56:36.660" style="s2">but he was really fascinated by this scene</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.660" end="01:56:44.200" style="s2">and you know, he was like locked on to it, it was frightening, but there was something in it that he was processing and catching (?) on to</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.200" end="01:56:51.360" style="s2">so anyways, you see the whale is starting to prepare to sneeze, and he&#39;s belching out huge quantities of smoke and fire</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.360" end="01:56:59.440" style="s2">and Pinokio and Gepetto and the cat and the goldfish bowl are all on the raft</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.440" end="01:57:05.440" style="s2">trying desperately to get out of the whale, which inhales and pulls them back, and then sneezes and pushes them forward</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.440" end="01:57:11.140" style="s2">and at some point they actually break free, and there&#39;s a &#39;gates of hell&#39; image there with the whale</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.140" end="01:57:15.220" style="s2">belching out smoke like mad and  its jaws open</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.220" end="01:57:19.860" style="s2">so they&#39;re paddling madly away, to get away from this whale</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.860" end="01:57:24.300" style="s2">and the whale is very angry, just as Gepetto suggested</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.300" end="01:57:28.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s interesting sound effects that go along with this</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.360" end="01:57:33.600" style="s2">the whale actually turns into a...</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.600" end="01:57:36.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens when your phone is smarter than you are</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.780" end="01:57:40.100" style="s2">the whale actually turns into into something that&#39;s like a locomotive</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.100" end="01:57:47.020" style="s2">and the sound effects become industrial; so it&#39;s this monstrous, machine-like locomotive dragon</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.020" end="01:57:52.460" style="s2">that&#39;s bent on the destruction of Pinokio</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.460" end="01:57:57.400" style="s2">and you could say it&#39;s an amalgam of natural and social forces, completely unleashed</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.400" end="01:58:02.120" style="s2">everything&#39;s unleashed against Pinokio and his father, and so...</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.120" end="01:58:06.060" style="s2">they&#39;re having a hell of a time, there&#39;s big waves, and they end up...</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.060" end="01:58:11.640" style="s2">the whale actually abandons them, but before he does that, it nails them with its tail, and blows the raft into smithereens</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.640" end="01:58:15.780" style="s2">and so then they&#39;e both in the water, and Gepetto and Pinokio are drowning</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.780" end="01:58:22.500" style="s2">and Gepetto actually goes down for the third time, so to speak; and as he&#39;s going down, he says to Pinokio:</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.500" end="01:58:25.100" style="s2">save yourself, save yourself</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.100" end="01:58:31.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s kinda Pinokio&#39;s last temptation, because Gepetto&#39;s had it, and he could just get to shore on his own</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.960" end="01:58:36.040" style="s2">but he would&#39;ve abandoned his father; and so that&#39;s the thing, is...</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.040" end="01:58:41.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the issues that this movie grapples with, is: what exactly is your responsibility?</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.300" end="01:58:47.680" style="s2">and you could say: well, it&#39;s to save yourself, but the myth that underlies this says: no it&#39;s not, that &#39;s not exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.680" end="01:58:53.560" style="s2">it&#39;s to rescue your father from the chatic depths, and integrate with that, and to save both</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.560" end="01:58:58.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s your duty to your culture; but more than that, it&#39;s also your duty to your soul</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.540" end="01:59:03.520" style="s2">it isn&#39;t gonna work, if you just save yourself, &#39;cause you&#39;re still gonna be a jackass puppet</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.520" end="01:59:06.120" style="s2">even though you&#39;re gonna be back on shore</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.120" end="01:59:12.000" style="s2">so anyways, Pinokio grabs Gepetto and carries him to shore; and the whale shows back up</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.000" end="01:59:17.060" style="s2">and gives them one more good wallop; and then we see everybody on shore</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.060" end="01:59:21.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s peaceful again, Gepetto is in his back on the dry land</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.360" end="01:59:28.880" style="s2">and the kitten washes up, and the goldfish bowl washes up, and the cricket washes up, he&#39;s been outside the whale all this time</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.880" end="01:59:36.260" style="s2">and we see the Cricket calling for Pinokio, and then we see him lying in a pool of water, dead</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.260" end="01:59:39.360" style="s2">so he&#39;s died</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.360" end="01:59:41.820" style="s2">rescuing his father, he died</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.820" end="01:59:47.920" style="s2">well, why? well, he is a jackass puppet, and maybe he was supposed to die if he rescued his father</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.920" end="01:59:51.640" style="s2">because that insufficiency that characterized him</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.640" end="01:59:56.160" style="s2">is something that&#39;s descroyed by the process of encountering the chaos</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.160" end="01:59:59.460" style="s2">which was so difficult it reforms the personality</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.460" end="02:00:06.820" style="s2">and the same occurs when he rescues his father and incorporates that, so it&#39;s like...</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.820" end="02:00:16.080" style="s2">Bilbo in the first part of the... what is it called? The Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit!</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.080" end="02:00:22.320" style="s2">he&#39;s this sort of jackass puppet guy, little overprotected Shire-dweller at the beginning</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.320" end="02:00:30.080" style="s2">and he goes on this tremendous adventure, and he has to develop the negative parts of his character, he actually has to become a professional thief</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.080" end="02:00:38.220" style="s2">and he has to develop his bravery, and... and so the old personality in some sense has to die to give life to the new one</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.220" end="02:00:43.760" style="s2">and so...</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.760" end="02:00:47.840" style="s2">you see in the Harry Potter series, too, at the very end</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.840" end="02:00:51.760" style="s2">Potter dies, and then is resurrected, right, that&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.760" end="02:00:56.220" style="s2">and that actually happens to a slightly lesser degree in the second movie</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.220" end="02:01:02.280" style="s2">where the resurrection is aided by the phoenix tears, after he gets eaten by the... or he gets chomped by that big snake</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.280" end="02:01:05.840" style="s2">which is, roughly speaking, the same thing that&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.840" end="02:01:07.500" style="s2">sorry about that</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.500" end="02:01:10.920" style="s2">okay, so anyways, Pinokio&#39;s dead, that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.920" end="02:01:16.220" style="s2">so, the next scene we see them back at home, and he&#39;s lying dead on the bed</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.220" end="02:01:21.160" style="s2">and Gepetto and everyone else are mourning his loss</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.160" end="02:01:28.200" style="s2">and then we see this magic transformation, and we hear the Blue Fairy&#39;s voice</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.200" end="02:01:35.140" style="s2">and so, it&#39;s like he&#39;s pushed himself to his limits, and a natural process kicks back in, and revivifies him</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.140" end="02:01:41.580" style="s2">but now he&#39;s no longer a jackass puppet, he&#39;s actually something that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.580" end="02:01:48.420" style="s2">and so then he wakes up and he notices that now, you know, he&#39;s undergone this proper transformation</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.420" end="02:01:50.960" style="s2">he notices his hands in particular</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.960" end="02:01:58.920" style="s2">and then he tells Gepetto, who refuses to even notice; he says: no, no, kid, you&#39;re dead, lie down</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.920" end="02:02:03.440" style="s2">so, you know, Pinokio convinces him that he&#39;s not dead, and then</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.440" end="02:02:07.900" style="s2">in celebration they start the clocks again, and so time kicks back in at that point</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.900" end="02:02:15.920" style="s2">and so, then they have a big celebration, music happens again, because this is a celebratory moment</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.920" end="02:02:23.300" style="s2">and they dance, and the harmony&#39;s restored, the good old guy has his son, and so</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.300" end="02:02:29.120" style="s2">the house is properly set up, and the old state has its vision, and its capacity for transformation</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.120" end="02:02:34.860" style="s2">and the thing that transforms has the stability of the culture behind it, and so - perfect</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.860" end="02:02:42.120" style="s2">and then the Cricket goes outside, and he&#39;s talking to the Start and the Blue Fairy, and he says that he&#39;s pretty happy about how this has gone</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.120" end="02:02:46.700" style="s2">and so, then she gives him this little medal</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.700" end="02:02:50.680" style="s2">which is made out of gold, and it&#39;s a sun, and it&#39;s a mandala, all at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.680" end="02:02:58.420" style="s2">and it&#39;s made out of gold, and gold is a noble metal, it doesn&#39;t mate indiscriminately with other metals</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.420" end="02:03:06.240" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t tarnish, and so it&#39;s a metal that represents the sun; and he flashes his little badge at the Star</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.240" end="02:03:14.060" style="s2">establishing a relationship between his function as the proper conscience and his orientation towards the highest good</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.060" end="02:03:19.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s it there, so he&#39;s got this little sun, he&#39;s wearing his little sun</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.320" end="02:03:24.340" style="s2">so he&#39;s also transformed and developed as a consequence of this entire process</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.340" end="02:03:28.020" style="s2">no Pinokio&#39;s conscience is properly oriented</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.020" end="02:03:34.560" style="s2">it&#39;s oriented towards the highest value; and then the movie closes</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.560" end="02:03:39.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s &quot;Pinokio&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.640" end="02:03:58.260" style="s2">so, I&#39;ll give you a minute, and I&#39;ll take some questions, and try to figure out how to shut my phone up</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.260" end="02:04:03.260" style="s2">so does anybody have any questions? yes -&gt;</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.260" end="02:04:10.600" style="s2">[student] you seem to have a vaguely psychoanalytic approach to kind of extracting the inarticulated messages</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.600" end="02:04:14.800" style="s2">from the mythologies and the stories and religion that&#39;s developed over time</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.800" end="02:04:22.760" style="s2">so could you almost say that those are kind of constructing this to a societal level out of the individual level</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.760" end="02:04:25.060" style="s2">that these are kind of the dreams of the collective unconscious?</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.060" end="02:04:28.420" style="s2">[Peterson] sure, that&#39;s exactly what they are</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.420" end="02:04:32.860" style="s2">they&#39;re the fantasies of the collective unconscious, that&#39;s one way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.860" end="02:04:37.700" style="s2">I mean, they also take a socially determined form</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.700" end="02:04:47.400" style="s2">right, because it&#39;s animated, and that&#39;s a technology, and it&#39;s obviously something that exists in a particular time and place</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.400" end="02:04:53.620" style="s2">but yeah, they&#39;re... it&#39;s a collective attempt to give voice to the oldest of behavioral patterns</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.620" end="02:04:56.880" style="s2">and so, here&#39;s one way of thinking about that</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.880" end="02:05:01.500" style="s2">which we&#39;ll talk about in some detail, which you should have read about, at least to some degree, already</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.500" end="02:05:05.980" style="s2">the question is: where is that knowledge represented?</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.980" end="02:05:13.620" style="s2">and Jung would say, well it&#39;s part of the collective unconscious, and it&#39;s got a biological origin, but</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.620" end="02:05:21.100" style="s2">his description of the biological nature of the collective unconscious is quite ambiguous</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.100" end="02:05:24.640" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s because it actually is ambiguous, like</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.640" end="02:05:34.200" style="s2">for example, we know that primates, and humans in particular, are at least biologically predisposed to be afraid of snakes</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.200" end="02:05:41.640" style="s2">so we can learn that very easily; now, you could make a case that it&#39;s more than biological predisposition, and that it&#39;s actually built in</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.640" end="02:05:49.080" style="s2">but I would say the predisposition idea is actually a better one, because you at least need the exposure to the snake to get it going</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.080" end="02:05:55.360" style="s2">so that would take place as a consequence of your experience, so it&#39;s not purely biological, although</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.360" end="02:06:03.320" style="s2">it is the case that snake fear tends to become more intense as you get older, which is not necessarily what you would expect</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.320" end="02:06:09.660" style="s2">and the... I just read a paper this week, localizing snake fear in primates, and it was hypothalamic</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.660" end="02:06:15.360" style="s2">it&#39;s really old, because the hypothalamus is a very old part of the brain, it&#39;s older than the amygdala</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.360" end="02:06:20.140" style="s2">and the amygdala is involved in snake fear as well, it&#39;s really, really old</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.140" end="02:06:26.300" style="s2">so you could say, well, you&#39;re prepared to develop snake fear, like you&#39;re prepared to develop language</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.300" end="02:06:30.260" style="s2">and like you&#39;re prepared to walk by your biological structure</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.260" end="02:06:36.820" style="s2">now, whether that actually  constitutes the contents of your memory, which is what Jung seems to imply</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.820" end="02:06:42.240" style="s2">is an open question, but it doesn&#39;t really matter, because...</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.240" end="02:06:50.200" style="s2">so, one time when I went to visit my nephew, he was running around in a knight suit</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.200" end="02:06:57.720" style="s2">he was only about 4 or 5; so he&#39;s acting out this mythological pattern, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.720" end="02:07:03.240" style="s2">and you&#39;d say, well, how did he know how to do that, and the answer would be: well, it was represented all around him in the culture</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.240" end="02:07:06.300" style="s2">in fragments, and like</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.300" end="02:07:09.440" style="s2">kids are pretty good in putting fragments of stories together</p>
<p begin="02:07:09.440" end="02:07:14.020" style="s2">that&#39;s really what understanding is, is to put fragments into story form</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.020" end="02:07:21.000" style="s2">and so, he watched Disney movies and his parents had read him storeis, and he did pretend play with the other kids, and</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.000" end="02:07:25.040" style="s2">all of those were like exemplars of this underlying narrative</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.040" end="02:07:32.220" style="s2">they&#39;re variants of it; and because he can abstract and generalize, he&#39;s pulling out the central features of those narratives</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.220" end="02:07:36.540" style="s2">the heroic features, and then embodying them; so you could say, well</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.540" end="02:07:43.620" style="s2">the central features of these narratives are fragmented and distributed across the entire culture</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.620" end="02:07:49.320" style="s2">and so, they don&#39;t have to be exactly inside your head, they don&#39;t have to be part of your memory</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.320" end="02:07:54.880" style="s2">they&#39;re distributed in the behavior, and the actions, and the stories of the entire culture</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.880" end="02:07:58.400" style="s2">and they just... you can put them together out of that</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.400" end="02:08:02.800" style="s2">so, and people do that, that&#39;s why they&#39;re so hungry for stories like...</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.800" end="02:08:10.660" style="s2">well, like this one, or like Star Wars, or like Star Trek, or like the Marvel movies, or like Harry Potter</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.660" end="02:08:15.100" style="s2">[student] yeah, what you said about the last scene, your son watching it over and over again</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.100" end="02:08:19.640" style="s2">my little brother did the same thing with the last scene of the first Harry Potter movie, the guy with the two faces?</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.640" end="02:08:22.000" style="s2">he watched that probably 20 or 30 times</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.000" end="02:08:27.320" style="s2">yeah, that&#39;s really interesting, watching little kids interact... like those movies are unbelievably complex</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.320" end="02:08:33.780" style="s2">I mean, you know, by the time you&#39;re your age, and you&#39;ve seen, you know, several hundred of then at minimum</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.780" end="02:08:38.020" style="s2">the impact wears off, but it&#39;s really something, sitting down with a four-year-old</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.020" end="02:08:44.220" style="s2">who hasn&#39;t watched very many movies, and walking through one with them, I mean they&#39;re so turned on it&#39;s just...</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.220" end="02:08:49.800" style="s2">I took my daughter when she was too young, actually... I took her to see &quot;The Mask&quot;, the Jim Carrey movie</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.800" end="02:08:53.840" style="s2">Jesus, I mean she survived it, I don&#39;t think I traumatized her</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.840" end="02:09:00.300" style="s2">but she was sitting on my lap, and it was really like gripping a bundle of barbed wire</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.300" end="02:09:03.780" style="s2">she was just like that the entire movie, you know</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.780" end="02:09:09.360" style="s2">and half way through I thought: well, that&#39;s probably a little too much psychophysiological intensity for one small body</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.360" end="02:09:13.780" style="s2">you know, but she... those movies, they just have a massive impact on little kids</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.780" end="02:09:18.960" style="s2">and they will do exactly that, they&#39;ll watch it over and over, and over, and you think: what are they doing exactly?</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.960" end="02:09:23.520" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to understand, they&#39;re gripped by it somehow</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.520" end="02:09:28.480" style="s2">right, and it&#39;s like they&#39;re deeply curious, they know there&#39;s something in it</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.480" end="02:09:34.420" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to extract out what it is, and they&#39;ll repeat it, and repeat it, so...</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.420" end="02:09:44.240" style="s2">they&#39;re hungry for the information &#39;cause it&#39;s part of rescuing their father from chaos, that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.240" end="02:09:49.620" style="s2">other questions?</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.620" end="02:09:56.440" style="s2">well, good enough then, let&#39;s call it a day; oh, there is one more question</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.440" end="02:10:02.280" style="s2">[student] so, in Maps of Meaning there is the idea that you keep returning to about</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.280" end="02:10:11.240" style="s2">when you first encounter the unknown it&#39;s like, it&#39;s first fearful; and then Jung has the idea of archetypes, so</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.240" end="02:10:19.320" style="s2">are there other kinds of meaning that people will find in new information that&#39;s already patterned into them?</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.320" end="02:10:21.940" style="s2">[Peterson] that&#39;s patterned into them or into the new information?</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.940" end="02:10:26.860" style="s2">[student] that&#39;s patterned into them, like ???, do people actually...?</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.860" end="02:10:32.460" style="s2">sure, well, they project the contents of their fantasy onto the unknown thing</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.460" end="02:10:37.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly a process of self-discovery</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.400" end="02:10:45.600" style="s2">you know, so, for example, let&#39;s say that you, you know, you&#39;re gripped by love at first sight or something like that</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.600" end="02:10:49.440" style="s2">now, you don&#39;t know anything about the person that you&#39;re tremendously attracted to</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.440" end="02:10:52.060" style="s2">but you&#39;ll have fantasies about them</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.060" end="02:10:55.960" style="s2">and that fantasy... in fact, your image of them is a fantasy</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.960" end="02:11:02.120" style="s2">and if you take that fantasy apart, you&#39;ll find out what you value</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.120" end="02:11:06.040" style="s2">so you are projecting, you&#39;re projecting yourself into the world; and you can discover...</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.040" end="02:11:11.960" style="s2">I mean you may also discover something about them, because there may be elements of them that match the ideal quite nicely, if you&#39;re fortunate</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.960" end="02:11:15.920" style="s2">and if your ideal is, you know, of a reasonable sort</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.920" end="02:11:20.660" style="s2">but you can... you definitely encounter yourself if you look at the unknown</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.660" end="02:11:25.620" style="s2">because you use your fantasy to structure the contact</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.620" end="02:11:30.620" style="s2">you know, and the fundamental structure is:the heroic encounter with the unknown</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.620" end="02:11:38.260" style="s2">because that&#39;s the pathway... that&#39;s the fundamental pathway of human beings, &#39;cause we&#39;re information foragers, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="02:11:38.260" end="02:11:44.900" style="s2">[student] so it&#39;s that automatic response and the fantasies as well, that are part of the first contact...</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.900" end="02:11:51.720" style="s2">[Peterson] sure, sure, well, that&#39;s also... yes, absolutely, that&#39;s exactly right, yes, so...</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.720" end="02:11:57.240" style="s2">I mean, imagine this, imagine that you&#39;re attracted to someone, and you&#39;re just too terrified to go speak to her</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.240" end="02:12:02.080" style="s2">well, what&#39;s happening? well, you have a fantasy of a judge</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.080" end="02:12:08.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s your imagined representation of your own insufficiency in relationship to the ideal</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.800" end="02:12:13.700" style="s2">and you project that on this person as a judge, and then you&#39;re too paralyzed to even open your mouth around her</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.700" end="02:12:17.160" style="s2">very common experience</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.160" end="02:12:25.260" style="s2">okay, let&#39;s call it a day, we&#39;ll see you in a week</p>
