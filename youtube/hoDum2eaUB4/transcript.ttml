<p begin="00:02:22.260" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">mescaline would be a heaven-sent gift</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:28.349" style="s2">without a counter poison but I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:31.400" style="s2">profoundly mistrustful of the pure gifts</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.349" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">of the gods you pay very dearly for them</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.400" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">this is not the point at all to know of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">or about the unconscious nor does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">story end here on the contrary it is how</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:43.319" style="s2">and where you begin the real quest if</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:44.849" style="s2">you are too unconscious it is a great</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.319" end="00:02:46.829" style="s2">relief to know a bit of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.849" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">unconscious but it soon becomes</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.829" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">dangerous to know more because one does</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">not learn at the same time how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">balance it through a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:56.220" style="s2">equivalent that is the mistake Aldous</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">Huxley makes he does not know that he is</p>

<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:21.800" style="s2">yeah so the reason that couple</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">paragraphs there came to mind I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.800" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">what young is getting at there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:31.740" style="s2">perhaps it cuts very close to the core</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">of what the element of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.740" end="00:03:35.430" style="s2">that&#39;s incumbent on anyone who decides</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:39.390" style="s2">they want to take a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.430" end="00:03:42.330" style="s2">substance has to come to terms with you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.390" end="00:03:45.210" style="s2">know we&#39;ve been talking about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.330" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">that these are if nothing else strange</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.210" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">and powerful things where strange here</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:52.500" style="s2">is the very essence of strange and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.890" end="00:03:54.330" style="s2">powerful is at least on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.500" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">psychological and perhaps spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.330" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">level the very essence of power and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:03.390" style="s2">question then becomes if you have such</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">experiences you can&#39;t quite put into</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.390" end="00:04:11.370" style="s2">words but feel somehow filled with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">sense of meaning to take or integrate</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.370" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">some of that experience into a life well</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">how do you go about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:24.510" style="s2">what should you orient towards what kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:27.960" style="s2">of life facilitates the integration of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.510" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">some of these experiences now young of</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:36.510" style="s2">collective unconscious and it&#39;s a vast</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.630" end="00:04:39.690" style="s2">domain of study filled with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.510" end="00:04:42.300" style="s2">requirement to have a real deep relation</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.690" end="00:04:45.060" style="s2">to a kind of psychological symbolism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.300" end="00:04:48.480" style="s2">an appreciation of thematic content that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.060" end="00:04:51.660" style="s2">I think cuts at this area of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.480" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">about truth and where something like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.660" end="00:04:55.410" style="s2">mystical parts of our world might meet</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:57.510" style="s2">the scientific endeavor and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.410" end="00:05:01.760" style="s2">these strange things that are brought</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.510" end="00:05:04.140" style="s2">together that pop up through and from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.760" end="00:05:06.300" style="s2">place that we can construe as the</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.730" end="00:05:15.240" style="s2">they pop up in our experience and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:18.810" style="s2">have the power in fact to orient our</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.240" end="00:05:22.140" style="s2">action but also reveal how it is we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.810" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">already acting how we might be relating</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.140" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">to our parents or</p>
