<p begin="00:00:40.770" end="00:00:46.720" style="s2">but we need these conversations to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.110" end="00:00:49.540" style="s2">become more public now I thinking we</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.720" end="00:00:52.150" style="s2">should start a club we can be the first</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.720" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">then we&#39;ll get to the third and we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.340" end="00:01:15.399" style="s2">as many as we can in an hour I also</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:18.789" style="s2">wanted to thank our moderator who is</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.399" end="00:01:22.329" style="s2">anonymous but is a good friend and doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.789" end="00:01:24.700" style="s2">just a bang-up job and we we appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.329" end="00:01:25.840" style="s2">you greatly and we don&#39;t we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.700" end="00:01:28.810" style="s2">the chats really see the super check</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.840" end="00:01:30.249" style="s2">questions but we know from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.810" end="00:01:32.829" style="s2">assessment that the moderator gives us</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.249" end="00:01:34.840" style="s2">after every time that you&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.829" end="00:01:35.459" style="s2">the good fight thank you indeed thanks</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.840" end="00:01:39.189" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.459" end="00:01:40.539" style="s2">ok so without further ado we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.189" end="00:01:41.950" style="s2">there was one question there have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.539" end="00:01:44.409" style="s2">questions every time that we&#39;ve missed</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.950" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">that have been good but there was one in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.409" end="00:01:47.950" style="s2">particular that we just didn&#39;t even see</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:50.709" style="s2">last time it came in at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.950" end="00:01:52.090" style="s2">super chat that was excellent I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.709" end="00:01:53.380" style="s2">to start with it and it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.090" end="00:01:56.740" style="s2">the same person has rewritten the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.380" end="00:01:59.349" style="s2">question this time so that gives me even</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.740" end="00:02:01.179" style="s2">more reason to prioritize this Morrigan</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.349" end="00:02:02.380" style="s2">rights if the left wants to win they</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.179" end="00:02:03.039" style="s2">need to care about the civil rights of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.380" end="00:02:05.919" style="s2">the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.039" end="00:02:07.869" style="s2">I have no public voice no news no social</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.919" end="00:02:09.340" style="s2">media gives me a platform the left will</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.869" end="00:02:11.740" style="s2">have no mercy for me or anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.340" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">thinks like I do if they win convince me</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.740" end="00:02:16.750" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:17.819" style="s2">yeah the this is really question of how</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.750" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">you parse things</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.819" end="00:02:22.349" style="s2">that thing out there that is putting</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:24.090" style="s2">people against the wall forcing them to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.349" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">bend the knee all of the things that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:28.109" style="s2">is doing it&#39;s not the left those people</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">may think they&#39;re the left but this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.109" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">the most intolerant movement I have seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">in my lifetime so the thing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:41.670" style="s2">understand is that essentially left and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:44.040" style="s2">right have become unimportant at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.670" end="00:02:46.680" style="s2">moment because what we are looking at is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.040" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">a challenge to the things that unite</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.680" end="00:02:52.919" style="s2">left and right now I got a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">from Dave Rubin yesterday in which he</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.919" end="00:02:56.909" style="s2">basically said that what we are all</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:58.739" style="s2">seeing is a demonstration that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.909" end="00:03:00.329" style="s2">Conservatives had it right all along and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.739" end="00:03:02.250" style="s2">that us liberals have to admit it this</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.329" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">is not the case this country was founded</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:09.980" style="s2">by radicals and liberals who have</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">upgraded the system again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.980" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">conservatives provide a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:18.980" style="s2">tension the Liberals left to their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">devices would muck the thing up with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.980" end="00:03:24.840" style="s2">overly great enthusiasm for change and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">for attempts to fix things and an</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.840" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">insufficient appreciation for unintended</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:33.209" style="s2">consequences so the tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">instinct to improve things and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.209" end="00:03:37.639" style="s2">desire to preserve that which functions</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:39.989" style="s2">is the magic that makes America work so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.639" end="00:03:41.970" style="s2">that is to say if you are on the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:43.979" style="s2">you are united with those on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.970" end="00:03:45.659" style="s2">who are making sense no matter how few</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.979" end="00:03:47.790" style="s2">of us there may be and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.659" end="00:03:49.650" style="s2">it&#39;s as few as as one might be led to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.790" end="00:03:51.209" style="s2">believe I think a lot of us have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.650" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">portrayed is on the right in order that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.209" end="00:03:54.629" style="s2">the left doesn&#39;t have to deal with us</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:58.259" style="s2">for the same reason they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.629" end="00:03:59.729" style="s2">science empowered they don&#39;t want cogent</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.259" end="00:04:01.259" style="s2">people on the Left saying hey wait a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.729" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">minute this isn&#39;t making sense to me get</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.259" end="00:04:06.359" style="s2">off your knees they don&#39;t want that so</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">anyway we&#39;re in this together the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.359" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">Patriots the people who understand the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:15.719" style="s2">values that make the West so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">and that make it the envy of the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.719" end="00:04:20.340" style="s2">the world those things are in jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">and we must all defend them so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.340" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">no left to right it&#39;s not that you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:26.980" style="s2">your rights protected as somebody on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">right if you&#39;re an honorable person</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.980" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">then you&#39;re on board with the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:34.570" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to protect all of our rights</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:36.490" style="s2">oh well I&#39;m gonna push back on that a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.570" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">little bit because I think that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.490" end="00:04:40.900" style="s2">wonderful but it sounds a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:42.220" style="s2">like fantasy space because we are we do</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.900" end="00:04:44.980" style="s2">have different you know we share values</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.220" end="00:04:47.500" style="s2">we share values across almost the entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.980" end="00:04:50.020" style="s2">left and almost the entire right but we</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.500" end="00:04:51.610" style="s2">do as you have most aptly of anyone I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.020" end="00:04:53.410" style="s2">ever heard described what you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.610" end="00:04:57.310" style="s2">differences are that we share values and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.410" end="00:04:58.450" style="s2">we and we disagree too on the extent to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.310" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">which we have already achieved those</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.450" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">values in society and on the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:04.750" style="s2">solutions that we that we seek to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:08.620" style="s2">resolve the remaining inequalities and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.750" end="00:05:10.420" style="s2">problems in society so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.620" end="00:05:12.670" style="s2">there are real differences and we do</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.420" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">speak in terms of left and right but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.670" end="00:05:17.710" style="s2">certainly agree with you that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:20.830" style="s2">leftists so-called just like the alt</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.710" end="00:05:22.990" style="s2">rightists so-called our extremists who</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.830" end="00:05:26.530" style="s2">really bear no resemblance to in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.990" end="00:05:28.360" style="s2">case of the leftist a liberal and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.530" end="00:05:29.170" style="s2">progressive understanding of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.360" end="00:05:30.820" style="s2">that we should be doing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.170" end="00:05:32.890" style="s2">just as the old rightists don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.820" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">resemblance to what good faith</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.890" end="00:05:38.830" style="s2">conservatives believe but I will say to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:40.390" style="s2">to the writers question Zach if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.830" end="00:05:44.020" style="s2">would put up this screen I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.390" end="00:05:46.290" style="s2">to show a screenshot of a tweet I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.020" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">a couple days ago in a long tweet thread</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.290" end="00:05:50.470" style="s2">totalitarianism always flies in on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">wings of beautiful ideals it lands</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.470" end="00:05:53.620" style="s2">gently flatters you and charms you makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.330" end="00:05:54.490" style="s2">you feel smart for recognizing how</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.620" end="00:05:57.100" style="s2">beautiful it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.490" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">do not be fooled it is dangerous those</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.100" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">ideals they are not what they seem and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:06.730" style="s2">it got a lot of attention but someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:08.740" style="s2">says to me in response you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.730" end="00:06:11.950" style="s2">definitely definitely not on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.740" end="00:06:13.420" style="s2">and this person is trying to claim the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.950" end="00:06:16.410" style="s2">mantle of being on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.420" end="00:06:19.330" style="s2">basically saying that I by speaking to</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.330" end="00:06:24.030" style="s2">cannot possibly be on the left and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.730" end="00:06:26.530" style="s2">strikes me as simultaneously a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.030" end="00:06:28.990" style="s2">horrifying misunderstanding of what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.530" end="00:06:31.450" style="s2">would be to seek to live in a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.990" end="00:06:36.010" style="s2">society and also take it down please</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.450" end="00:06:38.440" style="s2">sack also sorry I lost my train of</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.070" end="00:06:47.380" style="s2">though I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.380" end="00:06:52.600" style="s2">obviously there is and the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.870" end="00:06:55.180" style="s2">would say I&#39;m a radical is that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.600" end="00:06:56.229" style="s2">believe we need change now that we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.180" end="00:06:57.820" style="s2">in trouble in our current trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.229" end="00:06:59.889" style="s2">we&#39;ll be fatal if we don&#39;t have it which</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.820" end="00:07:02.889" style="s2">puts me on the left but I also have said</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.889" end="00:07:05.470" style="s2">I want to live in a civilization that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.889" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">so fair and so functional that I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.470" end="00:07:08.650" style="s2">afford to be a conservative we should</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:12.389" style="s2">all want to live in that society and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.650" end="00:07:14.770" style="s2">people who are who feel that they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.389" end="00:07:16.389" style="s2">always going to be in favor of change</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.770" end="00:07:17.590" style="s2">are basically telling you that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.389" end="00:07:19.660" style="s2">not really interested in building</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.590" end="00:07:22.419" style="s2">something wonderful so we can safely</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.660" end="00:07:27.460" style="s2">ignore them my point is just look we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.419" end="00:07:30.070" style="s2">facing a very powerful enemy and it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.460" end="00:07:31.510" style="s2">threatening the values that we share</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.070" end="00:07:34.510" style="s2">so of course we&#39;re on the same team</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.510" end="00:07:36.520" style="s2">right we&#39;re we&#39;re allies by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.510" end="00:07:38.050" style="s2">the fact that there&#39;s no disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.520" end="00:07:40.780" style="s2">amongst the good people about the values</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.050" end="00:07:43.030" style="s2">that are now under threat so anyway yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.780" end="00:07:44.410" style="s2">we can let&#39;s let&#39;s repeal this threat</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.030" end="00:07:46.060" style="s2">and get to a place where we can again</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.410" end="00:07:48.490" style="s2">fight over whether or not we need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.060" end="00:07:50.620" style="s2">make progress or preserve things as they</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.490" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">are that&#39;ll be wonderful if we get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.620" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">that point</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:07:57.820" style="s2">next question there&#39;s a good argument to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.530" style="s2">ignore race and genetics a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.820" end="00:08:01.930" style="s2">seems to be persistent historical</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.530" end="00:08:03.340" style="s2">anti-semitism Jewish success in many</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.930" end="00:08:06.070" style="s2">fields includes a quarter of Nobel</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.340" end="00:08:07.930" style="s2">laureates and that seems to be either a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.070" end="00:08:10.270" style="s2">general cognitive advantage or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.930" end="00:08:11.889" style="s2">Jewish conspiracy it&#39;s what I think I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.270" end="00:08:13.479" style="s2">think Eric and particular was talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.889" end="00:08:14.620" style="s2">about this and in the last live stream a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.479" end="00:08:17.320" style="s2">little bit I think he addressed some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.620" end="00:08:18.970" style="s2">this well you know that here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.320" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">problem is that the answer to this one</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.970" end="00:08:25.150" style="s2">is uncomfortable right is there</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:27.389" style="s2">something cognitively special about Jews</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.150" end="00:08:31.300" style="s2">or isn&#39;t there and I think the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.389" end="00:08:33.070" style="s2">there is but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s genetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.300" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not certainly not inherently</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.070" end="00:08:38.589" style="s2">genetic what I would say is there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:41.169" style="s2">something about the level of oppression</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.589" end="00:08:43.150" style="s2">and enduring it in other words there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.169" end="00:08:44.920" style="s2">something very anti fragile about Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.150" end="00:08:48.250" style="s2">thinking as a result of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.920" end="00:08:50.860" style="s2">challenges that you have faced and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.250" end="00:08:53.290" style="s2">you know I know from experience as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.860" end="00:08:54.730" style="s2">cultural geo not a religious Jew I know</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.290" end="00:08:56.350" style="s2">that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:08:58.540" style="s2">in the culture about holding each</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.350" end="00:09:01.720" style="s2">other&#39;s feet to the fire right it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.540" end="00:09:05.650" style="s2">dinner table conversation it was you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">know Passover Seder as it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.650" end="00:09:11.500" style="s2">baked into what it meant to be Jewish so</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:15.990" style="s2">much so that it was baked in it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.500" end="00:09:15.990" style="s2">actually big and you know the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.440" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">when you do that when every interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.420" end="00:09:23.050" style="s2">involves what I think people have</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.130" end="00:09:25.240" style="s2">actually frankly seen in our podcast</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.050" end="00:09:27.400" style="s2">hear us pushing back on each other and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.240" end="00:09:31.780" style="s2">it not being personal and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.400" end="00:09:33.640" style="s2">affection being a constant and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.780" end="00:09:37.300" style="s2">washing back and forth in the ebb and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.640" end="00:09:40.570" style="s2">flow of belief right that culture works</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.300" end="00:09:44.050" style="s2">to make you insightful and what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.570" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">said and it is sorry but it has me on my</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.050" end="00:09:49.570" style="s2">observation growing up in a non-jewish</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:50.950" style="s2">family but with my mother&#39;s dearest</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.570" end="00:09:52.390" style="s2">friend and business partner was Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.950" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">and so we spent a lot of time with her</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.390" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">and I came to think of her almost as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:58.540" style="s2">as a secondary mom and I had you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.100" style="s2">many Jewish friends whose homes I went</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.540" end="00:10:02.470" style="s2">to and spent time at and then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.100" end="00:10:05.500" style="s2">having spent a lot of time with your</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.470" end="00:10:07.410" style="s2">natal family at this point that the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.500" end="00:10:10.420" style="s2">consistent thing between all of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.410" end="00:10:14.860" style="s2">all of these families all of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.420" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">Jewish homes is the simultaneous loan</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.860" end="00:10:19.570" style="s2">respect and willingness to disagree and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">push back and it is that thing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.570" end="00:10:23.560" style="s2">exactly the opposite of the concept of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.400" end="00:10:25.570" style="s2">safe space and you know these super</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.560" end="00:10:27.250" style="s2">fragile little beings that can&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.570" end="00:10:29.290" style="s2">have disagreements the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.250" end="00:10:31.930" style="s2">helicopter parenting it&#39;s the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.290" end="00:10:34.990" style="s2">of so much of what we&#39;ve been taught to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.930" end="00:10:37.720" style="s2">value and that we see being ascendant in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.990" end="00:10:42.340" style="s2">modern culture and so you know why why</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.720" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">is that correlated with success in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.340" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">world in which not just collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">but yes also competition is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:52.870" style="s2">important well it&#39;s it is effectively an</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.910" style="s2">informal scientific method you end up</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.870" end="00:10:56.710" style="s2">testing your ideas because anytime you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.910" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">say anything that&#39;s wrong you know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.710" end="00:11:00.790" style="s2">people at the table are gonna figure out</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:02.530" style="s2">why it&#39;s wrong or try to help you figure</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.790" end="00:11:06.280" style="s2">out why it&#39;s wrong it just will happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.530" end="00:11:07.990" style="s2">yep and I want to push back slightly on</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.280" end="00:11:10.300" style="s2">the idea that you didn&#39;t grow up and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.990" end="00:11:16.120" style="s2">home because I think no I mean the point</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.300" end="00:11:18.279" style="s2">look but I know it&#39;s a head scratcher</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.120" end="00:11:19.959" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s not really because look I</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.279" end="00:11:21.160" style="s2">suspect my mother and my brother are</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.959" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">watching right now they&#39;re like what</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.160" end="00:11:27.190" style="s2">what are you talking right well here</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:30.990" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m talking about the magic</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.190" end="00:11:33.520" style="s2">of human beings is that they are a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.990" end="00:11:37.029" style="s2">generalist platform physically we are a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.520" end="00:11:39.910" style="s2">generalist creature with a mind that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.029" end="00:11:41.380" style="s2">not highly pre-programmed it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.910" end="00:11:42.670" style="s2">say it&#39;s a blank slate it isn&#39;t but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.380" end="00:11:45.730" style="s2">the blank a slate that has ever existed</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.670" end="00:11:48.970" style="s2">in nature right that blanks that blank</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.730" end="00:11:50.830" style="s2">ish slate allows a software program to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.970" end="00:11:52.390" style="s2">be loaded onto the mind and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.830" end="00:11:53.860" style="s2">your home wasn&#39;t Jewish in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.390" end="00:11:56.200" style="s2">that either of your parents were Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.860" end="00:11:57.700" style="s2">but you were you went to school with</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.200" end="00:11:58.890" style="s2">lots of Jews by virtue of where you</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.700" end="00:12:02.440" style="s2">lived in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.890" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">your mom&#39;s best friend was Jewish your</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.440" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">dad&#39;s work environment and computer</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:08.589" style="s2">science would have been filled with many</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:11.950" style="s2">Jews and the point is look it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.589" end="00:12:13.779" style="s2">every aspect of Jewishness is fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.950" end="00:12:15.220" style="s2">but the basis never had a seder at home</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.779" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.220" end="00:12:19.660" style="s2">culture wasn&#39;t omnipresent in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:22.089" style="s2">right and you know we live like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.660" end="00:12:24.130" style="s2">elsewhere right like we&#39;d take you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.089" end="00:12:26.529" style="s2">tomatoes to be part of Italian cuisine</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.130" end="00:12:28.149" style="s2">they&#39;re not they are not originally part</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.529" end="00:12:29.620" style="s2">of Italian cuisine but they&#39;ve been they</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.149" end="00:12:31.690" style="s2">can&#39;t be they come from a totally</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.620" end="00:12:33.700" style="s2">different continent right so the point</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.279" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">with tomatoes no of course not the point</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.779" end="00:12:42.520" style="s2">is tomatoes have been naturalized into</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.670" end="00:12:45.480" style="s2">Italian cuisine the way a Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.520" end="00:12:48.640" style="s2">perspective where I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.480" end="00:12:51.610" style="s2">affection and affinity are orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.640" end="00:12:52.990" style="s2">from agreement that is to say we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.610" end="00:12:54.910" style="s2">disagree and it has nothing to do about</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.990" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">whether we love each other and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.910" end="00:12:58.870" style="s2">I think you had a lot of that in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:00.579" style="s2">life I think it&#39;s you know herbs and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.870" end="00:13:02.589" style="s2">flows through judeo-christian culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.579" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">and the most important thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.589" end="00:13:06.310" style="s2">whatever extent it&#39;s good I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:07.329" style="s2">it&#39;s singular there are other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.310" end="00:13:10.120" style="s2">that will have every one of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.329" end="00:13:12.730" style="s2">aspects somewhere it&#39;s democratizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.120" end="00:13:15.339" style="s2">right yeah because it&#39;s culture and not</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.730" end="00:13:16.839" style="s2">dreams it can be passed on it can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.339" end="00:13:18.610" style="s2">utilized by anybody just like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.839" end="00:13:20.350" style="s2">scientific method and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.610" end="00:13:21.730" style="s2">democratization of the tools that work</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.350" end="00:13:23.769" style="s2">is the key</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.730" end="00:13:25.750" style="s2">and to the extent that Jews have</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.769" end="00:13:28.600" style="s2">demonstrated that it is possible to be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.750" end="00:13:29.949" style="s2">small and often despised group of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.600" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">and still thrive</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.949" end="00:13:35.230" style="s2">maybe Jews know something about how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:36.699" style="s2">do it so anyway I know that&#39;s complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.230" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">and weird but I do think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.699" end="00:13:41.860" style="s2">that Ruth flies I think we should come</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:44.050" style="s2">back to this frequently actually okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.860" end="00:13:46.060" style="s2">next question where does this go if</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.050" end="00:13:47.769" style="s2">social media and everyone in the public</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:49.959" style="s2">eye continues to kneel and effectively</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.769" end="00:13:51.459" style="s2">show their jugular to the Bob how can</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.959" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">the silent majority get the truth out to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.459" end="00:13:55.269" style="s2">those who are on the fence or who truly</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:56.620" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the issues so these</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.269" end="00:13:59.019" style="s2">again these are questions from the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.620" end="00:14:11.649" style="s2">live stream you know before we were on</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.019" end="00:14:14.170" style="s2">with with Eric unfortunately people want</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.649" end="00:14:16.089" style="s2">something they often want something from</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.170" end="00:14:17.470" style="s2">us I know I get approached frequently by</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.089" end="00:14:19.660" style="s2">people navigating these kinds of issues</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.470" end="00:14:22.120" style="s2">in their in their own life you know do I</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.660" end="00:14:23.949" style="s2">stand up I&#39;m in jeopardy how do I do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.120" end="00:14:25.990" style="s2">how do I make it safe there&#39;s no good</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.949" end="00:14:29.980" style="s2">answer and as I think we were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.990" end="00:14:31.449" style="s2">clear earlier today there&#39;s nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.980" end="00:14:34.740" style="s2">makes this moment safe in fact it could</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.449" end="00:14:37.899" style="s2">hardly be more perilous I know of no</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.740" end="00:14:39.250" style="s2">feature of the environment but that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.899" end="00:14:42.100" style="s2">stands between what we are currently</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.250" end="00:14:43.959" style="s2">seeing and a flat-out Maoist revolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.100" end="00:14:45.010" style="s2">that overturns everything right it could</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.959" end="00:14:46.569" style="s2">happen will it happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.010" end="00:14:48.519" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but it could and if it did</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.569" end="00:14:50.110" style="s2">what would that mean about what your</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.519" end="00:14:53.740" style="s2">fate would be for standing up I have no</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.110" end="00:14:56.980" style="s2">idea but what I can say is there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.740" end="00:14:59.649" style="s2">safety in cow towing to the mob or at</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.980" end="00:15:02.889" style="s2">least no safety that you&#39;d want it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.649" end="00:15:05.350" style="s2">a it&#39;s not a viable position for an</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.889" end="00:15:07.660" style="s2">intelligent person you will hate</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.350" end="00:15:10.209" style="s2">yourself for doing it and you will be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.660" end="00:15:13.060" style="s2">reviled by history so I think the answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.209" end="00:15:15.160" style="s2">do you do I mean I this is we are now in</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.060" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">a different position than we would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.160" end="00:15:20.110" style="s2">been if this were happening four years</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:22.089" style="s2">ago and we were unknown you know beloved</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.110" end="00:15:26.139" style="s2">at our college but unknown to the rest</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.089" end="00:15:28.060" style="s2">of the world biologists and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.139" end="00:15:29.649" style="s2">are doing what we know how to do but</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.060" end="00:15:31.660" style="s2">we&#39;re but it&#39;s still it&#39;s still too</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.649" end="00:15:33.370" style="s2">little and we&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.660" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">what else to do and you know the idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.370" end="00:15:35.500" style="s2">that you know Eric&#39;s going to get the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.959" end="00:15:38.080" style="s2">band back</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.500" end="00:15:42.360" style="s2">together its use his framing on social</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.080" end="00:15:46.290" style="s2">media and and you know bring together a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.360" end="00:15:49.270" style="s2">bigger conversation is is critical but</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.290" end="00:15:51.730" style="s2">what about people who don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.270" end="00:15:53.890" style="s2">kind of platform who are you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.730" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">finding themselves in zoom meetings</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.890" end="00:15:59.280" style="s2">right now where everyone begins by</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.560" end="00:16:02.830" style="s2">announcing their pronouns and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.280" end="00:16:04.300" style="s2">explaining how their inner racist is</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.830" end="00:16:07.510" style="s2">finally clear to them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.300" end="00:16:10.750" style="s2">apologetic for years to come and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.510" end="00:16:14.050" style="s2">know incidentally to Eric&#39;s point that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.750" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">he made in the last livestream about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.050" end="00:16:19.900" style="s2">seeming to be often the people with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:21.640" style="s2">least actual intimate knowledge you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.900" end="00:16:24.520" style="s2">in terms of friendship and family and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.640" end="00:16:26.260" style="s2">experience of other of people who look</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.520" end="00:16:27.760" style="s2">different who are doing this most this</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.260" end="00:16:29.200" style="s2">is actually a point that I have as you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.760" end="00:16:31.840" style="s2">as you know that I have made many times</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.200" end="00:16:33.550" style="s2">that I observed anecdotally I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.840" end="00:16:35.410" style="s2">even actually know how to begin to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.550" end="00:16:38.980" style="s2">the stats on it but I sort of began to</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.410" end="00:16:42.040" style="s2">try to what we saw at Evergreen was that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.980" end="00:16:44.589" style="s2">the people who were most loud and most</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.040" end="00:16:47.860" style="s2">most vociferous about their whiteness</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.589" end="00:16:50.200" style="s2">and their racism were exactly the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.860" end="00:16:52.060" style="s2">who I know just because I know who they</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.200" end="00:16:54.010" style="s2">are to have the least experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.060" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">world to have traveled the least to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.010" end="00:17:00.190" style="s2">the most sort of the most limited</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">homogeneous experience of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.190" end="00:17:04.030" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">wondering if they&#39;re racist or if they</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.030" end="00:17:08.170" style="s2">were just going wow I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:11.380" style="s2">but the fact is that those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.170" end="00:17:14.500" style="s2">actually have traveled have lived have</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.380" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">been in places where we aren&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.500" end="00:17:18.730" style="s2">we aren&#39;t the dominant phenotype even</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:20.290" style="s2">though our skin color always carries</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.730" end="00:17:23.260" style="s2">privilege no matter where we go on this</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.290" end="00:17:25.780" style="s2">planet we can we can look into our</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.260" end="00:17:28.870" style="s2">hearts and say you actually know not</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.780" end="00:17:30.460" style="s2">racist so stop making me pretend that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.870" end="00:17:32.110" style="s2">am something that I&#39;m not because I know</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.460" end="00:17:34.780" style="s2">what happens if you start making me lie</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.110" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">so the people who can&#39;t look into</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.780" end="00:17:38.980" style="s2">themselves and say well am i I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.930" style="s2">sure who can&#39;t come back with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.980" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">resounding I&#39;m sure or not are most</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.930" end="00:17:44.200" style="s2">likely to be the ones who are carrying</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:47.889" style="s2">the flags and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.200" end="00:17:50.860" style="s2">and you know basically making the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.889" end="00:17:52.659" style="s2">loudest of themselves in the streets and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.860" end="00:17:55.679" style="s2">trying to force the others to do the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.659" end="00:18:00.429" style="s2">same okay so here&#39;s my advice then good</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.679" end="00:18:03.100" style="s2">the the fact is if you do what they want</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.429" end="00:18:05.139" style="s2">you to do if you get on your knees and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.100" end="00:18:06.970" style="s2">you beg forgiveness and you swear that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.139" end="00:18:09.730" style="s2">they&#39;re right about what their claims</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.970" end="00:18:11.529" style="s2">are they will not respect you they will</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.730" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">use you and then they will throw you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.529" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">away at the end your fate is not going</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:18.779" style="s2">to be an honorable one you will either</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:25.299" style="s2">end up a servant or in a ditch that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.779" end="00:18:27.730" style="s2">means the best thing to do is to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.299" end="00:18:30.100" style="s2">your peace with the fact that there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.730" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">no safety to be had and then make your</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.100" end="00:18:34.539" style="s2">point about why it is that you are not</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:36.490" style="s2">compelled about this now if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.539" end="00:18:38.440" style="s2">honor on the other side it will</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.490" end="00:18:40.600" style="s2">recognize that the strength to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.440" end="00:18:43.230" style="s2">what&#39;s true and to stand up to this even</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.600" end="00:18:46.299" style="s2">though they don&#39;t like it is the sign of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.230" end="00:18:48.970" style="s2">somebody with integrity somebody with</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.299" end="00:18:50.590" style="s2">depth of character and it will not</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.970" end="00:18:53.409" style="s2">protect you it may put you on their</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.590" end="00:18:55.090" style="s2">radar but what it means is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.409" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">end you will be able to look at yourself</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.010" end="00:19:09.789" style="s2">consequence is the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.570" end="00:19:11.409" style="s2">personally to me of pretending I agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.789" end="00:19:13.480" style="s2">with this stuff would be so catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.409" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2">that there&#39;s just it&#39;s easy there&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.820" end="00:20:32.290" style="s2">necessary and true and honorable but</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.630" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to end well it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.020" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">struck me at the time that that was sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.929" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">of where I was too you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:53.380" style="s2">obviously I was I was behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:56.049" style="s2">you know with your emails and such but</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.380" end="00:21:00.730" style="s2">and you know and living a lot of it more</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.049" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">deeply than than they were but they</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.730" end="00:21:06.309" style="s2">almost I think they were almost asking</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:09.490" style="s2">me like given that he must know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.309" end="00:21:11.590" style="s2">danger does he understand the risks and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.490" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">at the same time these two people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.590" end="00:21:16.049" style="s2">both know you pretty darn well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:18.610" style="s2">saying we understand it&#39;s not a choice</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.049" end="00:21:20.860" style="s2">yeah it was it&#39;s not choice it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.610" end="00:21:24.460" style="s2">choice yeah and you know I think this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.860" end="00:21:26.950" style="s2">also has something to do with with</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.460" end="00:21:28.660" style="s2">Jewish culture especially growing up</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.950" end="00:21:30.970" style="s2">when we did which you know and she</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.660" end="00:21:32.260" style="s2">aren&#39;t my oldest friend our good friend</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.970" end="00:21:36.820" style="s2">from only time I get was also Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.260" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">she&#39;s also doing and I&#39;m sure he his</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.820" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">father is his Japanese japanese-american</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:43.660" style="s2">his father was in the camps the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:46.540" style="s2">Japanese internment camps so both of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.660" end="00:21:48.940" style="s2">these people have familial history</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.540" end="00:21:51.700" style="s2">oh you&#39;ll experience deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.940" end="00:21:55.990" style="s2">oppression but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.700" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">you know we were we were both born in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.990" end="00:22:01.960" style="s2">1969 so that seemed during our</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:02.890" style="s2">childhoods at least to me like a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.960" end="00:22:05.050" style="s2">long distance from</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.890" end="00:22:07.450" style="s2">world war ii world war ii felt like deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.050" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">history but of course it wasn&#39;t right it</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.450" end="00:22:15.550" style="s2">was recent and anyway the discussions</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:17.500" style="s2">amongst kids the discussions at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.550" end="00:22:19.270" style="s2">dinner table all those things were kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.500" end="00:22:21.670" style="s2">of preparation for well what if this</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.270" end="00:22:25.570" style="s2">happens again right it can happen again</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.670" end="00:22:27.700" style="s2">it can always happen and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.570" end="00:22:28.930" style="s2">there&#39;s just there&#39;s a circuit people</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.700" end="00:22:31.030" style="s2">say you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.930" end="00:22:35.650" style="s2">we would have done you know in nazi</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.030" end="00:22:37.390" style="s2">germany you don&#39;t know and i feel like i</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.650" end="00:22:39.550" style="s2">know right and you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.390" end="00:22:42.670" style="s2">swallow them what would have happened</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.550" end="00:22:44.620" style="s2">well would have taken a shot at as many</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.670" end="00:22:46.450" style="s2">nazis as i could and i probably would</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.620" end="00:22:50.220" style="s2">have died in the process period it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.450" end="00:22:52.330" style="s2">not have ended up in the camp right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.220" end="00:22:55.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which that&#39;s unfair</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.330" end="00:22:56.860" style="s2">because germans at the time german jews</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.330" end="00:22:57.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the experience of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.860" end="00:23:00.010" style="s2">where it was going</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.730" end="00:23:01.660" style="s2">but having grown up at a time when i did</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.010" end="00:23:03.790" style="s2">have the benefit of seeing what happened</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.660" end="00:23:05.800" style="s2">in those circumstances it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.790" end="00:23:07.810" style="s2">even a question now there are things</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.800" end="00:23:08.260" style="s2">that give one pause it always looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.810" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.260" end="00:23:12.160" style="s2">of course right like so you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:16.330" style="s2">any you history doesn&#39;t repeat itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.160" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">you know but it rhymes right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.330" end="00:23:20.290" style="s2">how close does it have to be for you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:22.750" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.290" end="00:23:24.580" style="s2">that&#39;s a it&#39;s the same enough thing this</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.750" end="00:23:26.260" style="s2">is so weird to talk about because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.580" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">so personal but i feel like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.260" end="00:23:30.370" style="s2">matter okay you know and i feel like it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.360" end="00:23:33.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter because it has to lie it</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.370" end="00:23:35.950" style="s2">has to lie that ideology yeah yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.850" end="00:23:37.660" style="s2">has to lie and if it has to lie then all</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.950" end="00:23:40.210" style="s2">you have to do is be resistant to being</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.660" end="00:23:41.890" style="s2">able to be forced into a line and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.210" end="00:23:43.990" style="s2">certainly safe from becoming part of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.890" end="00:23:48.510" style="s2">you&#39;re not safe but you say from</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.990" end="00:23:48.510" style="s2">becoming part of it and so no i feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.690" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">pretty much completely secure that such</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.700" end="00:23:56.230" style="s2">a thing could not arise and trick me</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:57.700" style="s2">right it&#39;s not to say i can&#39;t be fooled</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.230" end="00:24:00.280" style="s2">by anything but if it&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.700" end="00:24:02.890" style="s2">power grabs that forces you into an</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.280" end="00:24:05.500" style="s2">ideology that isn&#39;t right in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.890" end="00:24:08.110" style="s2">its bidding because it&#39;s obvious what</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.500" end="00:24:09.610" style="s2">it&#39;s doing so once and some of it is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.110" end="00:24:12.250" style="s2">know some of some of the easier advice</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.610" end="00:24:15.570" style="s2">to give is look at what look at how</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.250" end="00:24:17.639" style="s2">cults function yeah and if</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.570" end="00:24:21.629" style="s2">if it yells at you when you start</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.639" end="00:24:23.609" style="s2">questioning it it run away if you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.629" end="00:24:25.590" style="s2">allowed to assess how it came to its</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.609" end="00:24:28.409" style="s2">conclusions or disagree with any of its</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.590" end="00:24:35.999" style="s2">conclusions right away yeah James</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.409" end="00:24:38.580" style="s2">Lindsay has been lazy yeah and his</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.999" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">poison is his strongest point in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.580" end="00:24:43.799" style="s2">realm is at the point that it distances</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:45.479" style="s2">you from your family you know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.799" end="00:24:47.100" style="s2">up to if it doesn&#39;t want you talking to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.479" end="00:24:49.849" style="s2">your family and friends there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.100" end="00:24:51.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s because it cannot withstand</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.849" end="00:24:53.159" style="s2">pushback yeah it cannot withstand</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.960" end="00:24:56.940" style="s2">scrutiny yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.159" end="00:24:58.499" style="s2">so all I can say is I think you&#39;ll feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.940" end="00:25:00.539" style="s2">better the sooner you make your peace</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.499" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">with the danger and the sooner you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.539" end="00:25:05.190" style="s2">become clear about what you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:06.809" style="s2">why and then you know it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.190" end="00:25:09.979" style="s2">interesting story to be on the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.809" end="00:25:12.419" style="s2">side of so good luck</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.979" end="00:25:14.489" style="s2">oK we&#39;ve got a couple of comments before</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.419" end="00:25:16.919" style="s2">more question so many questions here</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.489" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">really comes through three of them this</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.919" end="00:25:20.970" style="s2">is a comment continuous equivocation</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.820" end="00:26:43.410" style="s2">people being by equitable because until</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.610" end="00:26:46.049" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone down this rabbit hole you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.410" end="00:26:47.660" style="s2">think it means you think equity is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.049" end="00:26:50.309" style="s2">same thing as equality and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.660" end="00:26:52.760" style="s2">equality is something we can and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.309" end="00:26:55.169" style="s2">should get behind equality under the law</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.760" end="00:27:00.679" style="s2">equality of opportunity insofar as it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.169" end="00:27:04.440" style="s2">possible but equity is a way of changing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.679" end="00:27:07.530" style="s2">changing outcomes after all of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.440" end="00:27:12.150" style="s2">opportunity has already ended such that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.530" end="00:27:15.510" style="s2">some people are lifted up in a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.150" end="00:27:17.580" style="s2">unequal way so there&#39;s that that there</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.510" end="00:27:19.620" style="s2">is a lot in the concept of equity that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.580" end="00:27:21.929" style="s2">legitimately can be pushed back against</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.620" end="00:27:24.809" style="s2">I&#39;d be interested to hear good faith</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.929" end="00:27:25.980" style="s2">defense of the concept of equity but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.809" end="00:27:27.390" style="s2">is it is one of these things that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.980" end="00:27:29.460" style="s2">slid in as if it&#39;s equivalent to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.390" end="00:27:32.039" style="s2">equality and it&#39;s not and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.460" end="00:27:34.200" style="s2">other question is about anti-racist I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.039" end="00:27:37.140" style="s2">was how is it not being racist distinct</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.200" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">from being anti-racist so the problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.140" end="00:27:43.880" style="s2">with all of these things is that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:46.260" style="s2">are they are Trojan horse concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.880" end="00:27:48.539" style="s2">obviously any reasonable person should</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.260" end="00:27:49.710" style="s2">be anti-racist until people define that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.539" end="00:27:52.169" style="s2">term in such a way that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.710" end="00:27:54.360" style="s2">possibly be it because it is the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.169" end="00:27:55.980" style="s2">of anti racism all right these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.360" end="00:27:57.630" style="s2">are all going to be turned on their head</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.980" end="00:28:00.270" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.630" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">equity equity used to mean something</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.270" end="00:28:04.860" style="s2">very close to equality and then it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:08.429" style="s2">transmuted into something that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.860" end="00:28:12.030" style="s2">actually so if you know if equality of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.429" end="00:28:14.039" style="s2">opportunity is the desired goal then</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.030" end="00:28:16.049" style="s2">equity is like the communist version or</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.039" end="00:28:18.360" style="s2">was like the communist version which has</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.049" end="00:28:20.549" style="s2">a quality of outcome and now equity has</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.360" end="00:28:22.830" style="s2">been transmuted into something even far</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.549" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">beyond what communism communism doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.830" end="00:28:27.900" style="s2">work but it&#39;s at least coherent the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">claim is coherent what it&#39;s a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.900" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">ideology yeah it&#39;s a coherent ideology</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.640" end="00:28:33.059" style="s2">that won&#39;t work for reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:34.679" style="s2">actually come down to group selection</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.059" end="00:28:35.470" style="s2">and game theory but never mind we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.679" end="00:28:39.190" style="s2">talk about that another</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.470" end="00:28:41.650" style="s2">but the equity movement now is not even</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.190" end="00:28:44.380" style="s2">communist it&#39;s beyond communist because</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.650" end="00:28:45.850" style="s2">what it is really advocating for is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.380" end="00:28:47.860" style="s2">state and you can you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.850" end="00:28:51.610" style="s2">hear it in the the thing that Eric read</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.860" end="00:28:52.870" style="s2">from was it Caltech or you can hear it</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.610" end="00:28:55.090" style="s2">in what was being said to us at</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.870" end="00:28:58.390" style="s2">Evergreen that equity will not be</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.090" end="00:29:00.970" style="s2">achieved until every single person</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.390" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">graduating is equally capable right or</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.970" end="00:29:05.620" style="s2">ignores in the case of Celt in the case</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:06.970" style="s2">of just like the example that we know so</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:08.049" style="s2">well evergreen in the case of evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.970" end="00:29:12.570" style="s2">which is when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.049" end="00:29:16.539" style="s2">yep the goal that they stated was that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.570" end="00:29:19.809" style="s2">they needed to see equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.539" end="00:29:23.650" style="s2">as well yeah at the end of a college</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.809" end="00:29:26.710" style="s2">graduation having let people in a mere</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.650" end="00:29:29.289" style="s2">four years earlier with extremely</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.710" end="00:29:31.390" style="s2">unequal beginnings now are those</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.289" end="00:29:32.980" style="s2">extremely unequal beginnings at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.390" end="00:29:36.059" style="s2">point that they&#39;re 18 or 20 or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.980" end="00:29:39.100" style="s2">they are at the point they enter college</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.059" end="00:29:41.350" style="s2">honorable and should we you know should</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.100" end="00:29:43.570" style="s2">we think that that&#39;s okay in a free and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.350" end="00:29:45.610" style="s2">liberal society no but the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.570" end="00:29:48.370" style="s2">can fix all of the problems that led to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.610" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">people entering college with unequal</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.370" end="00:29:53.260" style="s2">levels of degree of preparation and</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.610" end="00:30:07.030" style="s2">the thing though obviously it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.320" end="00:30:08.679" style="s2">preposterous logical claim that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.030" end="00:30:11.169" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly be what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.679" end="00:30:13.450" style="s2">and so what they are saying how is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.169" end="00:30:16.179" style="s2">that you could take a college of four</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.450" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">thousand students and guarantee that on</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.179" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">graduation everybody is equally capable</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.179" end="00:30:28.690" style="s2">they graduate there is no feat of magic</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.460" end="00:30:30.070" style="s2">that could be done there&#39;s no amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.690" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">money you could invest in the process</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.070" end="00:30:33.580" style="s2">that would make that happen well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:35.320" style="s2">you you could pull a Vonnegut level find</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.320" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">you do they are inherently talking about</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.950" end="00:30:48.460" style="s2">that they claim that they want so at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:49.149" style="s2">point that you realize we&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.820" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">of racists right and and then I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.780" end="00:33:58.020" style="s2">asked her and I think she at that point</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:01.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t know the answer I don&#39;t think she</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.020" end="00:34:02.780" style="s2">does to this day actually are they going</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.140" end="00:34:06.350" style="s2">to be shocked when you show up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.780" end="00:34:08.669" style="s2">deliver an actually inclusive message or</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.350" end="00:34:13.020" style="s2">do the people who hired you know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.669" end="00:34:15.929" style="s2">you are and are they actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.020" end="00:34:17.790" style="s2">subvert the postmodern BS paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.929" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">has taken over and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.790" end="00:34:20.220" style="s2">which it was but it kind of doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.690" end="00:34:21.780" style="s2">matter because she reported it always</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.220" end="00:34:23.610" style="s2">had to be the latter</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.780" end="00:34:25.290" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think it matters</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.610" end="00:34:27.080" style="s2">because you know she came and she did</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.290" end="00:34:31.020" style="s2">her two-day workshop and she reported</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.080" end="00:34:34.290" style="s2">such you know such community tears of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.020" end="00:34:36.780" style="s2">joy and of and of sadness but you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.290" end="00:34:39.000" style="s2">just this glorious coming together to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.780" end="00:34:43.050" style="s2">left people feeling enriched and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.000" end="00:34:44.790" style="s2">uplifted and hopeful and that&#39;s what can</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.050" end="00:34:48.510" style="s2">be done so I don&#39;t know of any other</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.790" end="00:34:51.270" style="s2">example but yes it can be done well okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.510" end="00:34:53.429" style="s2">I don&#39;t know of any other examples like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.270" end="00:34:55.889" style="s2">that one yeah but the basic idea here</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.429" end="00:34:59.490" style="s2">this is I mean we have been learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.889" end="00:35:02.430" style="s2">this trick all along right since May of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.490" end="00:35:04.530" style="s2">2017 and before and the question is can</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.430" end="00:35:06.060" style="s2">you figure out how to phrase what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.530" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">actually believe explain why you</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.060" end="00:35:11.610" style="s2">actually believe it without succumbing</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:13.710" style="s2">to the stigma that is used to cancel</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.610" end="00:35:15.720" style="s2">people and the very fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.710" end="00:35:18.300" style="s2">here tells you that this has work</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.720" end="00:35:21.119" style="s2">so far all right being able to outline</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.300" end="00:35:24.540" style="s2">why you believe what you believe is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">learned art and in this culture where</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.540" end="00:35:27.660" style="s2">people are gunning for you especially if</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:29.790" style="s2">you&#39;re in a position to reveal why</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.660" end="00:35:32.750" style="s2">they&#39;re being absurd foolish and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.790" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">dangerous it is an important one so</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.750" end="00:35:36.390" style="s2">anyway you&#39;re right yes those statements</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:38.940" style="s2">would be great I would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.390" end="00:35:42.630" style="s2">practicing this and discovering what</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.940" end="00:35:44.700" style="s2">works and what fails and why and what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.630" end="00:35:46.740" style="s2">need really is everybody to bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.700" end="00:35:48.119" style="s2">the part of a response that they are in</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:49.349" style="s2">a good position to deliver and those</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.119" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">statements would be a very good</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.349" end="00:35:58.050" style="s2">contribution yes they would okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:35:59.369" style="s2">gonna read three more from here and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.050" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll get back to them if there aren&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.369" end="00:36:00.900" style="s2">ton of questions and the other live</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:03.630" style="s2">chats</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.900" end="00:36:04.770" style="s2">I&#39;m also I&#39;ve also pulled aside excuse</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.630" end="00:36:07.619" style="s2">me there are a few questions directly</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.770" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">speaking to the podcast that you put up</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.619" end="00:36:11.940" style="s2">with URI digan beggin beggin I never get</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:13.470" style="s2">it right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.940" end="00:36:16.020" style="s2">so we&#39;re just gonna put those aside for</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.470" end="00:36:18.060" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do a live stream Q&amp;A with</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.020" end="00:36:20.930" style="s2">him at some point soon so I&#39;ll make sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.060" end="00:36:23.160" style="s2">you&#39;ll get those to answer those later</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.930" end="00:36:25.260" style="s2">do you have thoughts on the similarities</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.160" end="00:36:27.030" style="s2">between Instagram black squares forced</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.260" end="00:36:29.849" style="s2">public privileged apologies washing feet</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.030" end="00:36:31.589" style="s2">etc and the two minutes of hate slash</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.589" end="00:36:36.599" style="s2">five while still smelling rats at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.180" end="00:36:39.420" style="s2">end of 1984 and I think I think this was</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.599" end="00:36:43.470" style="s2">asked pretty early in the first live</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.420" end="00:36:46.710" style="s2">stream and yeah I I don&#39;t think we are</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.470" end="00:36:49.410" style="s2">living exactly in a 1984 world I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.710" end="00:36:52.740" style="s2">it&#39;s more brave new world but there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.410" end="00:36:54.540" style="s2">obviously remarkable similarities</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.740" end="00:36:56.550" style="s2">especially in terms of the tactics I</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.540" end="00:36:58.619" style="s2">think Orwell got the tactics exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.550" end="00:37:00.630" style="s2">right without getting the resulting</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.619" end="00:37:03.930" style="s2">world described quite as accurately as</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.630" end="00:37:06.570" style="s2">what um Huxley didn&#39;t it&#39;s a chimera I</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.930" end="00:37:08.580" style="s2">would say yeah and I would also say the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.570" end="00:37:10.980" style="s2">important thing especially with respect</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.580" end="00:37:15.930" style="s2">to or well is that Orwell wrote</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.980" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">extensively not in narrative form and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.930" end="00:37:19.170" style="s2">the extent that nineteen eighty-four</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">resonates and that we find passages in</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.170" end="00:37:22.170" style="s2">it absolutely shocking because of their</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:23.730" style="s2">match for what we are living through the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.170" end="00:37:27.480" style="s2">point is it reflects well on his model</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.730" end="00:37:28.710" style="s2">of how things function and he gave us a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.480" end="00:37:29.320" style="s2">pretty good indicator of what he thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.710" end="00:37:31.060" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.320" end="00:37:34.780" style="s2">unless you know just the obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.060" end="00:37:35.890" style="s2">a plug for narrative right that the vast</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.780" end="00:37:38.440" style="s2">majority of us wouldn&#39;t know who or</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.890" end="00:37:41.800" style="s2">Allah was if he only did his scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.440" end="00:37:42.910" style="s2">nonfiction analysis yeah but you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.800" end="00:37:45.220" style="s2">and then the same with Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.910" end="00:37:47.860" style="s2">I think Huxley also did some analysis</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.220" end="00:37:52.690" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t fiction but certainly Orwell</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.860" end="00:37:54.580" style="s2">did next question if one were to learn</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.690" end="00:37:56.530" style="s2">one of the hard sciences at a PhD level</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.580" end="00:37:59.740" style="s2">outside of institutions one is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:38:02.050" style="s2">possible to if so how hmm readily</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.740" end="00:38:02.740" style="s2">possible readily possible especially in</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.050" end="00:38:06.130" style="s2">this era</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.740" end="00:38:07.960" style="s2">now you can HD level he asks well it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.130" end="00:38:11.500" style="s2">depends what you mean I would say most</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.960" end="00:38:14.800" style="s2">PhDs are not very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.500" end="00:38:17.620" style="s2">contributions and so you know in terms I</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.800" end="00:38:20.470" style="s2">would say the the methods though of many</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.620" end="00:38:22.360" style="s2">of the sciences require and this is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.470" end="00:38:24.610" style="s2">is because of the way the socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.360" end="00:38:26.350" style="s2">model of big science in universities has</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.610" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">gone not because of anything intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.350" end="00:38:32.170" style="s2">to science but most PhD level science</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:34.780" style="s2">over in the skin and biology and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.170" end="00:38:36.340" style="s2">chemistry realms require labs with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.780" end="00:38:38.710" style="s2">of money so that&#39;s gonna that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.340" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">very hard to to source on your own</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.710" end="00:38:44.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of sort of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:46.810" style="s2">evolutionary theory and over in math</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.050" end="00:38:49.540" style="s2">space and potentially in physics space</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.810" end="00:38:51.790" style="s2">that you can potentially do well without</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.540" end="00:38:53.470" style="s2">the labs suffice it to say there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.790" end="00:38:54.910" style="s2">things you cannot do because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.470" end="00:38:56.740" style="s2">technology cannot be sourced</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.910" end="00:38:58.660" style="s2">individually that is certainly do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.740" end="00:39:00.790" style="s2">if you&#39;re a physicist whose work</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.660" end="00:39:03.640" style="s2">requires a Collider you need access to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.790" end="00:39:05.980" style="s2">the collider right right but there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.640" end="00:39:07.270" style="s2">many PhDs where you could figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.980" end="00:39:08.470" style="s2">to do the work I don&#39;t know that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.270" end="00:39:11.740" style="s2">would be worth you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.470" end="00:39:13.120" style="s2">time wasted in a PhD process and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.740" end="00:39:15.310" style="s2">could do better and I think actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.120" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">Yuri dagan is a great demonstration he</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.310" end="00:39:20.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a PhD but he has a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:23.650" style="s2">deep understanding of how the highly</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.710" end="00:39:26.020" style="s2">technical biological realm that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.650" end="00:39:30.820" style="s2">intersects his business life works yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.020" end="00:39:33.450" style="s2">and so look autodidact are wonderful the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.820" end="00:39:35.980" style="s2">tools that are available to you between</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.450" end="00:39:37.600" style="s2">you know people on youtube we&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.980" end="00:39:38.950" style="s2">to teach you to do just about anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.600" end="00:39:40.059" style="s2">you would want to do at a technical</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.950" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.059" end="00:39:45.189" style="s2">and all of the source material that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:50.709" style="s2">would tell you how to process think</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.189" end="00:39:53.859" style="s2">about the the resulting data yes of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.709" end="00:39:56.949" style="s2">course it&#39;s possible but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.859" end="00:39:59.019" style="s2">about PhDs that is a waste of your time</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.949" end="00:40:01.029" style="s2">and so you could probably do the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.019" end="00:40:05.949" style="s2">equivalent in terms of getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.029" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">value in three years if you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.949" end="00:40:11.709" style="s2">to please a committee that had other</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:13.180" style="s2">obligations and things like them okay do</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.709" end="00:40:15.729" style="s2">you think that today is overly</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.180" end="00:40:18.670" style="s2">nihilistic pop culture which deifies the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.729" end="00:40:20.769" style="s2">bad guys as in Game of Thrones Joker</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.670" end="00:40:22.420" style="s2">Rick and Morty Bojack horseman is</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.769" end="00:40:25.809" style="s2">reflective of some of the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.420" end="00:40:28.569" style="s2">Theory&#39;s surfacing today as in the 16:19</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.809" end="00:40:32.519" style="s2">project so let me just parse that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.569" end="00:40:36.719" style="s2">little bit the 16:19 project being this</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.519" end="00:40:40.630" style="s2">ascendant attempt by the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.719" end="00:40:43.259" style="s2">to describe the history of the United</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.630" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">States entirely through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.259" end="00:40:50.709" style="s2">everything was built on on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:51.939" style="s2">labor on the enslaved labor of black</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.709" end="00:40:55.209" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.939" end="00:40:58.839" style="s2">the 16:19 project has I think earned a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.209" end="00:41:01.059" style="s2">Pulitzer at this point it is right it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.839" end="00:41:02.859" style="s2">it has been adopted in several school</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.059" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">curricula for I believe starting next</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.859" end="00:41:10.979" style="s2">year and it has been widely widely</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:13.660" style="s2">discredited by many historians across</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.979" end="00:41:16.439" style="s2">many demographic markers including at</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.660" end="00:41:18.759" style="s2">least political ideology and race so</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.439" end="00:41:21.099" style="s2">there are there are many reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.759" end="00:41:23.729" style="s2">think that this is in fact a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.099" end="00:41:26.769" style="s2">take on the history of race in America</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.729" end="00:41:29.650" style="s2">which obviously in here you know Eric&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.769" end="00:41:32.679" style="s2">words ring in my ear do we need to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.650" end="00:41:33.939" style="s2">that slavery existed and that it was bad</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.679" end="00:41:39.099" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we do</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.939" end="00:41:42.939" style="s2">but the 16:19 project is obviously at</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.099" end="00:41:44.349" style="s2">one level an attempt to describe that</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.939" end="00:41:46.150" style="s2">but it does not appear to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.349" end="00:41:48.339" style="s2">good-faith attempt any more than a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.150" end="00:41:50.170" style="s2">hashtag black lives matter appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.339" end="00:41:51.220" style="s2">good faith and yet it is ascendant to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.170" end="00:41:53.140" style="s2">justice hash</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.220" end="00:41:56.500" style="s2">black lives matters so the question then</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.140" end="00:41:59.770" style="s2">is the deification of bad guys in</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.500" end="00:42:03.160" style="s2">today&#39;s Neil istic pop culture does that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.770" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">contribute to the ascendancy of pomo</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.160" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">Bowl like the 16:19 project you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:12.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fair question but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:15.250" style="s2">think that that&#39;s it&#39;s far from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.750" end="00:42:17.619" style="s2">description purely of what&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.250" end="00:42:20.770" style="s2">place in pop culture in other words even</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.619" end="00:42:22.780" style="s2">in places where there&#39;s a lot of glory</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.770" end="00:42:24.550" style="s2">shown amongst the bad guys</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.780" end="00:42:27.250" style="s2">it&#39;s very frequently the bad guys with</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.550" end="00:42:30.930" style="s2">honour that are the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.250" end="00:42:33.460" style="s2">characters you and I have a a long</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.930" end="00:42:36.730" style="s2">relationship with the character Omar</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.460" end="00:42:41.319" style="s2">little on the wire who was a bad guy he</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.730" end="00:42:43.810" style="s2">was a gun-toting robber but he robbed</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.319" end="00:42:45.700" style="s2">drug dealers and anyway he was a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.810" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">interesting complex character so I do</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.700" end="00:42:50.130" style="s2">things gotta have a good man gots to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:53.650" style="s2">have a go gotta go</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.130" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">so the thing is really we&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.650" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">we&#39;re rewatching right now with our boys</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:01.780" style="s2">the extraordinary series peaky blinders</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:04.750" style="s2">which yeah they&#39;re they&#39;re mobsters at</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.780" end="00:43:06.930" style="s2">some level I mean that&#39;s nice but boy</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.750" end="00:43:11.950" style="s2">are they complex and rich and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.930" end="00:43:14.380" style="s2">really I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t seen all</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.950" end="00:43:18.760" style="s2">of the things on the list here I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.380" end="00:43:20.650" style="s2">think that we have a problem maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.760" end="00:43:23.319" style="s2">would point than to the particular</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.650" end="00:43:28.060" style="s2">pop-culture references made here rather</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.319" end="00:43:31.089" style="s2">to the deification of superhero culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.060" end="00:43:33.940" style="s2">that soup that that through Marvel</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.089" end="00:43:36.280" style="s2">Comics places the pure good against the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.940" end="00:43:38.500" style="s2">pure evil I think I&#39;m less familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.280" end="00:43:41.560" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in that space but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.500" end="00:43:43.930" style="s2">think that that that is a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.560" end="00:43:45.849" style="s2">what has entered especially kids minds</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.930" end="00:43:48.010" style="s2">growing up into a world in which they</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.849" end="00:43:49.030" style="s2">actually think that if evil always looks</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.010" end="00:43:51.400" style="s2">like that they&#39;ll know it when they see</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.030" end="00:43:53.560" style="s2">it and oh if I&#39;ve got a label that says</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.400" end="00:43:55.690" style="s2">I&#39;m anti that I&#39;m anti fascist or</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.560" end="00:43:57.849" style="s2">whatever it is well then I must be on</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.690" end="00:43:59.740" style="s2">the good side yeah I think that&#39;s deep I</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.849" end="00:44:02.910" style="s2">think that there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.740" end="00:44:04.310" style="s2">cartoon efficacious involved in</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.910" end="00:44:07.710" style="s2">superheroes</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.310" end="00:44:09.930" style="s2">that does result in a tendency to take</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.710" end="00:44:12.120" style="s2">that in which there is grey and shove it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.930" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">one side or the other I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.120" end="00:44:15.270" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:18.780" style="s2">hey Zach you want to show us box again</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.270" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">thank you that resonates for me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.780" end="00:44:22.500" style="s2">let&#39;s keep track of that idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:24.150" style="s2">yeah no it&#39;s it&#39;s something I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.500" end="00:44:26.130" style="s2">about a little bit and I think actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.150" end="00:44:29.340" style="s2">the there&#39;s a there&#39;s another piece of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.130" end="00:44:30.570" style="s2">it which is something we&#39;ve also talked</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.340" end="00:44:33.870" style="s2">about before which is the Disneyfication</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.570" end="00:44:37.710" style="s2">so quite different from the sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.870" end="00:44:40.410" style="s2">know I think especially boys but</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.710" end="00:44:42.540" style="s2">increasingly everyone grow up on these</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.410" end="00:44:45.660" style="s2">these sort of superhero supervillain</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.540" end="00:44:47.730" style="s2">narratives but then the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.660" end="00:44:49.410" style="s2">Disney narratives tend to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.730" end="00:44:51.690" style="s2">simplistic in a way that appeals</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.410" end="00:44:53.730" style="s2">especially to girls but increasingly to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.690" end="00:44:57.870" style="s2">everyone as well and both of these just</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.230" end="00:45:04.650" style="s2">the wrong way right like fiction is</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.910" end="00:45:06.570" style="s2">powerful because it tells us something</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.650" end="00:45:08.610" style="s2">real and deep about ourselves and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.570" end="00:45:10.860" style="s2">allows us access to those truths that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.610" end="00:45:12.600" style="s2">maybe a dispassionate analytical</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.860" end="00:45:13.710" style="s2">analysis would not just exactly in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.600" end="00:45:14.970" style="s2">same way that we know in nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.710" end="00:45:16.830" style="s2">eighty-four and none of us knows the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.970" end="00:45:19.290" style="s2">name of an essay that Orwell wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.830" end="00:45:20.610" style="s2">the same stuff right but it requires</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.290" end="00:45:23.220" style="s2">that the fiction is deep and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.610" end="00:45:25.650" style="s2">complex and the characters are plausibly</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.220" end="00:45:27.870" style="s2">real and the situation&#39;s could happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.650" end="00:45:30.210" style="s2">and you know even I say this as a huge</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.870" end="00:45:32.940" style="s2">fan of and writer of science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.210" end="00:45:33.840" style="s2">that even that stuff which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.940" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">speculative</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.840" end="00:45:38.820" style="s2">you know specfic speculative fiction the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:42.270" style="s2">best of it is not does not have</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.820" end="00:45:45.570" style="s2">one-dimensional societies or systems or</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.270" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">characters and yet so much of literally</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.570" end="00:45:51.530" style="s2">the cartoon universe yeah the superhero</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:53.970" style="s2">universe the Disney universe has</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.530" end="00:45:59.310" style="s2">incredibly simple narratives that leave</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.970" end="00:46:01.620" style="s2">people with a sense of of utopia being</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.310" end="00:46:03.150" style="s2">possible and it&#39;s not so I suspect we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.620" end="00:46:04.860" style="s2">gonna get a lot of pushback on this</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.150" end="00:46:06.510" style="s2">point because there are a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.860" end="00:46:07.770" style="s2">who are deeply involved in these</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.510" end="00:46:09.540" style="s2">universes and I do think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.770" end="00:46:10.920" style="s2">something important taking place there</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.540" end="00:46:12.690" style="s2">but really the question is is there</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.920" end="00:46:13.980" style="s2">something is there a dimension removed</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.690" end="00:46:16.050" style="s2">in order for these stories to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.980" end="00:46:17.160" style="s2">extraordinary and the way they are and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.050" end="00:46:19.740" style="s2">is that thing have</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.160" end="00:46:21.990" style="s2">developmental impact on people and I do</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.740" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">wonder I know Martin Scorsese got in</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.990" end="00:46:26.780" style="s2">trouble for saying effectively that he</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t consider these things cinema I</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.780" end="00:46:30.900" style="s2">didn&#39;t say that no at all and I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:32.849" style="s2">didn&#39;t say they&#39;re not well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.900" end="00:46:34.410" style="s2">think what he said was terrible I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.849" end="00:46:37.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t even I didn&#39;t go that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.410" end="00:46:40.589" style="s2">far Yeah right I am saying I think there</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.140" end="00:46:43.530" style="s2">is a simplicity of character and world</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.589" end="00:46:45.000" style="s2">of development that if it is a majority</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.530" end="00:46:47.190" style="s2">of what you were being exposed to as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.000" end="00:46:49.500" style="s2">child especially if you are also being</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.190" end="00:46:51.900" style="s2">drugged and helicopter parented and kept</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.500" end="00:46:54.299" style="s2">from all risk of course you end up</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.900" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">coming of age supposedly an adult deeply</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.299" end="00:46:57.960" style="s2">confused about the nature of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:46:59.490" style="s2">possible and you may really actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.960" end="00:47:01.650" style="s2">think that abolishing the police is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.490" end="00:47:06.150" style="s2">plausible answer to the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.650" end="00:47:11.160" style="s2">society you may actually I agree yeah ok</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.150" end="00:47:13.859" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna skip to questions from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.160" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">next one and then the next one and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.859" end="00:47:21.720" style="s2">next one let&#39;s say you&#39;ve said sorry</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.880" end="00:47:23.099" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to get to all these</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.720" end="00:47:26.609" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.099" end="00:47:29.130" style="s2">I didn&#39;t hear discuss Marxism in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.609" end="00:47:30.660" style="s2">Dark Horse talk Bret do you believe or</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.130" end="00:47:33.809" style="s2">not believe that Marxist philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.660" end="00:47:37.910" style="s2">driving any of this oh this clearly has</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.809" end="00:47:40.890" style="s2">a relationship to Marxism it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.910" end="00:47:46.020" style="s2">exactly a version of Marxism we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.890" end="00:47:47.039" style="s2">the association with it is you know if</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.020" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">you&#39;re painting with a broad brush it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.039" end="00:47:51.690" style="s2">just does and frankly there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">Marxism in academia and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.690" end="00:47:56.279" style="s2">academic Marxism you know in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:58.140" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s there&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.279" end="00:48:00.690" style="s2">stuff in Marx&#39;s critique of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.140" end="00:48:04.650" style="s2">it&#39;s just not it&#39;s not like everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.690" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">mark said was wrong but the conflation</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.650" end="00:48:08.579" style="s2">of the critique with the prescription</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:12.210" style="s2">the prescription is wrong we know why</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.579" end="00:48:14.760" style="s2">the prescription is wrong right and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.210" end="00:48:16.260" style="s2">fact that a prescription that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.760" end="00:48:17.789" style="s2">that and is even looks to be an</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.260" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">extension of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.789" end="00:48:22.440" style="s2">is unfolding in the streets that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:24.859" style="s2">demands appear not only to be tactically</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.440" end="00:48:27.450" style="s2">Marxist but they also appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.859" end="00:48:29.540" style="s2">thematically Marxist the direction they</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.450" end="00:48:32.810" style="s2">push is clearly a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.540" end="00:48:34.490" style="s2">solution or some Marxist non solution</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.810" end="00:48:37.340" style="s2">it&#39;s an empty set because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.490" end="00:48:39.410" style="s2">utopian that even you know even somebody</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.340" end="00:48:40.730" style="s2">who believed in 20th century Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.410" end="00:48:43.460" style="s2">would know that this was not going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.730" end="00:48:45.950" style="s2">work so anyway yeah it has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.460" end="00:48:47.300" style="s2">with Marxism and I don&#39;t think we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.950" end="00:48:52.310" style="s2">to focus too much on that I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.300" end="00:48:57.080" style="s2">frankly maoism is a better match that</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.310" end="00:49:00.170" style="s2">maoism is obviously a flavour of Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.080" end="00:49:02.510" style="s2">but the Maoism whether or not to Mao ISM</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.170" end="00:49:04.190" style="s2">is great enough that that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.510" end="00:49:07.670" style="s2">ought to look for our best historical</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.190" end="00:49:11.180" style="s2">parallel ok is there any evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.670" end="00:49:13.490" style="s2">aspect intuition or a product of skill</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.180" end="00:49:16.430" style="s2">based behavior which it&#39;s that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.490" end="00:49:19.100" style="s2">counterpoint right right so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.430" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">thing there&#39;s good intuition which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.100" end="00:49:24.890" style="s2">well tutored and there&#39;s naive intuition</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:26.450" style="s2">which is not well tutored intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.890" end="00:49:28.190" style="s2">the product of parts of your mind that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.450" end="00:49:30.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t have direct conscious access</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.190" end="00:49:32.540" style="s2">to which give you a conclusion that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.080" end="00:49:36.700" style="s2">either based on lots of experience or</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.540" end="00:49:41.180" style="s2">not so you know there&#39;s a phrase in</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.700" end="00:49:43.940" style="s2">Aeronautics if it doesn&#39;t look right it</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.180" end="00:49:46.520" style="s2">won&#39;t fly right ok so like for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.940" end="00:49:49.940" style="s2">the the stealth fighter</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.520" end="00:49:51.560" style="s2">nicknamed the hobbling goblin right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.940" end="00:49:54.530" style="s2">a very ugly plane and it doesn&#39;t fly</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.560" end="00:49:56.690" style="s2">very well it does avoid radar right but</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.530" end="00:49:59.240" style="s2">but the basic point is look your</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.690" end="00:50:01.250" style="s2">intuition about what a flying aircraft</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.240" end="00:50:03.020" style="s2">looks like is tutored by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.250" end="00:50:04.580" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen lots of flying aircraft and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.020" end="00:50:06.170" style="s2">people who know flying aircraft well</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.580" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">they know what a dihedral is and these</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.170" end="00:50:10.040" style="s2">sorts of things they have an even better</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:11.900" style="s2">tutored intuition and so they can look</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.040" end="00:50:14.360" style="s2">at a plane and kind of tell whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.900" end="00:50:17.500" style="s2">a plausible design there&#39;s limits to it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.360" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff that you can do you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.500" end="00:50:22.670" style="s2">whatever it is out there in Mojave</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:23.690" style="s2">though something rather composites you</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.670" end="00:50:25.250" style="s2">know these are planes that don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.690" end="00:50:26.990" style="s2">like historical planes that prove that</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.250" end="00:50:30.830" style="s2">these things are possible but</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.990" end="00:50:32.870" style="s2">nonetheless intuition is tutored by</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.830" end="00:50:34.760" style="s2">experience those who have a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.870" end="00:50:36.920" style="s2">experience in a realm will have high</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.760" end="00:50:38.600" style="s2">quality intuition and it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.920" end="00:50:40.790" style="s2">nothing mystical about this it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.600" end="00:50:43.490" style="s2">simply the nature of your mind being</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.790" end="00:50:47.930" style="s2">only partially conscious</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.490" end="00:50:49.430" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve said previously that Trump</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.930" end="00:50:51.740" style="s2">is the wrong leader for the situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.430" end="00:50:53.600" style="s2">what type of leader do we need and is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.740" end="00:51:00.200" style="s2">better to have Trump than an ultra woke</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.600" end="00:51:02.750" style="s2">leader that last parts of tricky one</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.200" end="00:51:06.620" style="s2">yeah anacs like you know it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.750" end="00:51:09.070" style="s2">tricky we did we as much as Biden as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.620" end="00:51:12.080" style="s2">decrepit clown and I won&#39;t vote for him</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.070" end="00:51:15.230" style="s2">one thing we did see was the ultra woke</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.080" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">on the incredibly numerous slate of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.230" end="00:51:21.650" style="s2">democratic Democrats who were running</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.950" end="00:51:24.620" style="s2">did get thrown off relatively quickly</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.650" end="00:51:26.630" style="s2">although what we did see was candidates</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.620" end="00:51:29.420" style="s2">who know someone like Elizabeth Warren</p>

<p begin="00:53:23.089" end="00:53:27.319" style="s2">phrase right side of history annoys me</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.619" end="00:53:28.969" style="s2">that means well nothing if you care</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.939" end="00:53:43.939" style="s2">I&#39;m Jewish I get to use Nazis as an</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.949" end="00:53:47.029" style="s2">example the fact is the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.939" end="00:53:48.650" style="s2">that phrase is not that my side is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.029" end="00:53:50.539" style="s2">right side of history it&#39;s that there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.650" end="00:53:52.489" style="s2">a side that will be understood in</p>

<p begin="00:53:52.489" end="00:53:56.719" style="s2">of history and that this is not based on</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:58.429" style="s2">who won okay the Nazis would have been</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.719" end="00:54:01.249" style="s2">the wrong side of history irrespective</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.429" end="00:54:03.709" style="s2">of who one man in the high castle is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.249" end="00:54:06.859" style="s2">very interesting narrative I suggest it</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.709" end="00:54:08.630" style="s2">it takes the other path through that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.859" end="00:54:11.959" style="s2">moment of history and see how things</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.630" end="00:54:14.689" style="s2">look but nonetheless the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.959" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">can look back on the Nazi era and say I</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.689" end="00:54:21.079" style="s2">know who I want to have been right I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">want to have been this person I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.079" end="00:54:24.650" style="s2">danger being that person so how do I</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.569" style="s2">restructure so I&#39;m no longer in danger</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.650" end="00:54:28.609" style="s2">of being that person and only this</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.569" end="00:54:31.489" style="s2">person is a possibility that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.609" end="00:54:36.199" style="s2">question and frankly I have seen the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.489" end="00:54:38.089" style="s2">term right side of history abused into</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.199" end="00:54:40.009" style="s2">uselessness that&#39;s the problem it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.089" end="00:54:41.569" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t useful it&#39;s very useful</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.009" end="00:54:43.309" style="s2">but it&#39;s also fragile and it cannot</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.569" end="00:54:45.349" style="s2">withstand people abusing it so I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.309" end="00:54:48.409" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re detecting it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.349" end="00:54:50.479" style="s2">abuse of it not the useful utility of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.409" end="00:54:52.369" style="s2">the concept itself so please let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.479" end="00:54:54.439" style="s2">rehabilitate it or at least give it a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.369" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">break it&#39;s not absurd on its face it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.439" end="00:54:59.240" style="s2">absurd in the way people use it</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:00.980" style="s2">are you familiar with media accounts</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.240" end="00:55:02.630" style="s2">from the Ukraine and elsewhere that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.980" end="00:55:04.599" style="s2">claim Russian troll farms are working on</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.630" end="00:55:07.010" style="s2">social media to inflame the protesters</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.599" end="00:55:10.309" style="s2">legitimate journalism or anti Russian</p>

<p begin="00:55:11.540" end="00:55:16.190" style="s2">the final question legitimate journalism</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.369" end="00:55:17.260" style="s2">or anti Russian propaganda always a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.190" end="00:55:19.940" style="s2">question</p>

<p begin="00:55:19.940" end="00:55:25.339" style="s2">I mean here&#39;s what we do know we know</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.549" end="00:55:28.490" style="s2">that there are sock puppets all over</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.339" end="00:55:31.160" style="s2">social media my guess is they&#39;re hired</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.490" end="00:55:33.020" style="s2">routinely by many many different</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.160" end="00:55:34.790" style="s2">entities that have the resources to hire</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.020" end="00:55:36.920" style="s2">them in shape opinion about everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.790" end="00:55:39.619" style="s2">from whether you like this mac and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.920" end="00:55:41.859" style="s2">cheese more than that to whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.619" end="00:55:44.900" style="s2">you think these people our heroes or</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.859" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">runaway Maoists or whatever so so you</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.440" end="00:55:54.410" style="s2">marketing work for like Nike you know to</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.609" end="00:55:57.349" style="s2">figure out if putting a black lives</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.410" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">matter fist up in their advertising is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.349" end="00:56:02.390" style="s2">going to incite site people to buy shoes</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:04.970" style="s2">and site is the wrong word there but</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.390" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">maybe not every manner of manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.970" end="00:56:09.740" style="s2">is happening we know that the Navy had a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:12.140" style="s2">program for sock puppets I just was</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.740" end="00:56:13.970" style="s2">years ago but they had a software to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.140" end="00:56:15.650" style="s2">manage them and all this stuff so look</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.970" end="00:56:18.170" style="s2">there&#39;s sock puppets all over the damn</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.650" end="00:56:19.730" style="s2">thing there are false followers that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.170" end="00:56:21.290" style="s2">people can buy themselves in order to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.730" end="00:56:22.790" style="s2">make themselves look more important than</p>

<p begin="00:56:22.790" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">and worst one of all in my opinion far</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.510" end="00:56:31.369" style="s2">more dangerous than sock puppets and</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:33.619" style="s2">phony followers and stuff like that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.369" end="00:56:35.950" style="s2">the algorithms themselves these these</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.650" end="00:57:15.750" style="s2">having on our suspicions of other people</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.720" end="00:57:17.220" style="s2">and all that stuff so you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.750" end="00:57:20.970" style="s2">like Tristan Harris didn&#39;t try to warn</p>

<p begin="00:57:40.710" end="00:57:46.440" style="s2">to divide us they&#39;re they&#39;re jockeying</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.170" end="00:57:48.270" style="s2">for position yeah he said he thought we</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.440" end="00:57:49.590" style="s2">were being played didn&#39;t know by what</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.270" end="00:57:51.570" style="s2">but he felt strongly we were being</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.590" end="00:57:55.650" style="s2">played look I mean when we&#39;ve got you</p>

<p begin="00:57:55.650" end="00:57:59.880" style="s2">knew I didn&#39;t trust you when he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.270" end="00:58:00.170" style="s2">followed by a you like what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.880" end="00:58:04.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.170" end="00:58:06.890" style="s2">cutter well exactly yeah I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.320" end="00:58:09.390" style="s2">contractor no big enemies now we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.890" end="00:58:11.670" style="s2">finally gone and done it yeah yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.390" end="00:58:13.230" style="s2">gotten the key what you playing everyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.670" end="00:58:15.600" style="s2">is going to agree on is that we&#39;re first</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.230" end="00:58:16.650" style="s2">against the wall right they&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.600" end="00:58:22.290" style="s2">just that&#39;s good that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.650" end="00:58:24.570" style="s2">bring them together okay we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.290" end="00:58:25.890" style="s2">couple of questions almost an hour</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.570" end="00:58:26.790" style="s2">okay I wanna we&#39;re gonna try to get</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.890" end="00:58:30.090" style="s2">through a few more of these we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.790" end="00:58:31.830" style="s2">few questions from a candidate for</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.090" end="00:58:33.360" style="s2">governor in Washington who&#39;s interested</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.830" end="00:58:34.650" style="s2">in defining the police and not for an</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.360" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">income tax who&#39;s trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.650" end="00:58:39.660" style="s2">positive difference is trying to reach</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">out it&#39;s we get a lot of people trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.660" end="00:58:42.900" style="s2">to reach out appreciate that it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:46.140" style="s2">like you may be trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.900" end="00:58:47.610" style="s2">positive difference though you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.140" end="00:58:49.470" style="s2">mentioned that the BLM group isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.610" end="00:58:50.700" style="s2">trustworthy could you expand on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.470" end="00:58:52.560" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to figure out for me what</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.700" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">comes from BLM proper and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.560" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">that is exactly where it is shut down</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:58.410" style="s2">stem actually come from for instance</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.640" end="00:59:00.420" style="s2">yeah a lot of the stuff is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.410" end="00:59:04.470" style="s2">cryptic and some of it can be sorted out</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.420" end="00:59:07.410" style="s2">some of its hiding in plain sight I</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.470" end="00:59:09.750" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how close the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.410" end="00:59:11.730" style="s2">relationship is between BLM and shut</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.750" end="00:59:14.190" style="s2">down stem what I can say is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.730" end="00:59:16.200" style="s2">consistency of those two messages</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.190" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">marching together through time is so</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.200" end="00:59:20.010" style="s2">great that it doesn&#39;t matter the point</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:22.800" style="s2">is it&#39;s one movement it has objectives</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.010" end="00:59:24.810" style="s2">right shut down stem as a side</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.800" end="00:59:26.250" style="s2">project of the thing that is rioting in</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.810" end="00:59:28.080" style="s2">the streets and the riots in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.250" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">are a side project of something that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.080" end="00:59:31.890" style="s2">wants power in all sorts of institutions</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:34.500" style="s2">and it has its plans and basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.890" end="00:59:36.960" style="s2">everything it&#39;s advocating everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.500" end="00:59:39.960" style="s2">it&#39;s advocating is a suspension of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.960" end="00:59:41.760" style="s2">rules that usually allow something</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.960" end="00:59:44.700" style="s2">useful to emerge those rules aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.760" end="00:59:46.620" style="s2">perfect there&#39;s lots of noise right not</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.700" end="00:59:48.090" style="s2">enough signal but what they want is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.620" end="00:59:49.710" style="s2">suspension of the rules where do they</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.090" end="00:59:51.480" style="s2">want a suspension of the rules well</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.710" end="00:59:53.610" style="s2">let&#39;s get rid of the police we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.480" end="00:59:56.850" style="s2">suspend the rules they will suspend the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.610" end="00:59:59.580" style="s2">rule of law will suspend Occam&#39;s razor</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.850" end="01:00:01.530" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna suspend every rule that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.580" end="01:00:03.960" style="s2">usually find frustrating and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.530" end="01:00:05.100" style="s2">gonna put us in charge so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.960" end="01:00:06.870" style="s2">listen to that voice that wants to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.100" end="01:00:09.570" style="s2">suspend all the rules that that way lies</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.870" end="01:00:12.270" style="s2">madness that way is warlordism pure and</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.570" end="01:00:14.070" style="s2">simple yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.270" end="01:00:17.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve lost where I am again because my</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.070" end="01:00:19.470" style="s2">trackpad isn&#39;t working how how would you</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.970" end="01:00:21.270" style="s2">respond to the claim that it is not the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.470" end="01:00:22.590" style="s2">scientific method that is flawed but</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.270" end="01:00:25.920" style="s2">rather that people of color are</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.590" end="01:00:30.390" style="s2">systematically denied access to stem I</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.920" end="01:00:32.040" style="s2">would say that in the past people of</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.390" end="01:00:34.470" style="s2">color were system Athleta night access</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.040" end="01:00:36.360" style="s2">to stem just like women weren&#39;t just you</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.470" end="01:00:39.900" style="s2">know like like as we have already said</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.360" end="01:00:42.720" style="s2">like a lot of people were poor people</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.900" end="01:00:45.180" style="s2">were people people without rich families</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.720" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">were women were people of color all of</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.180" end="01:00:51.270" style="s2">this but I don&#39;t see any evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:53.130" style="s2">this is true now in fact I see quite the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.270" end="01:00:56.630" style="s2">opposite now is the quite the opposite a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.130" end="01:01:01.050" style="s2">fairly new phenomenon maybe but does</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.630" end="01:01:03.840" style="s2">what is going on in stem look open and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.050" end="01:01:06.570" style="s2">inclusive and welcoming even though the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.840" end="01:01:08.850" style="s2">numbers of people aren&#39;t a match for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.570" end="01:01:12.270" style="s2">ratios of those demographics in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.850" end="01:01:15.150" style="s2">general population yeah it looks really</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.270" end="01:01:17.880" style="s2">actually inviting and inclusive in part</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.150" end="01:01:19.830" style="s2">because what stem is is searching for</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.880" end="01:01:23.310" style="s2">what is actually true in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.830" end="01:01:25.380" style="s2">and why on earth in a modern liberal</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.310" end="01:01:28.020" style="s2">world would you hobble yourself by not</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.380" end="01:01:30.210" style="s2">including some people in the equation</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.020" end="01:01:32.910" style="s2">you pick you pick the best regardless of</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.210" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">what else is true of them well it even</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.910" end="01:01:37.710" style="s2">goes beyond that because</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:40.050" style="s2">these Sciences housed inside</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.710" end="01:01:43.080" style="s2">universities universities are for better</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.050" end="01:01:46.410" style="s2">or worse liberal institutions people</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.080" end="01:01:48.300" style="s2">like it when somebody who is from a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.410" end="01:01:50.820" style="s2">demographic that is understood to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.300" end="01:01:52.800" style="s2">oppressed shows up in the room because</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.820" end="01:01:54.450" style="s2">it relieves them and you know even just</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.800" end="01:01:57.600" style="s2">cynically it relieves them of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.450" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">accusation that they are displaying</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.600" end="01:02:06.050" style="s2">racism so it&#39;s welcoming right now in my</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:08.760" style="s2">opinion there are things that prevent</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.050" end="01:02:11.430" style="s2">blacks for example from showing up at</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.760" end="01:02:15.170" style="s2">the upper echelon of the sciences but</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.430" end="01:02:18.450" style="s2">those things have a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.170" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">deeper more complex problems so for</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.450" end="01:02:22.080" style="s2">example what effect is led in your water</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:25.380" style="s2">have on the likelihood that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.080" end="01:02:26.520" style="s2">end up in a math department well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.380" end="01:02:27.600" style="s2">know but there are places with led in</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.520" end="01:02:28.920" style="s2">the water and you&#39;re much more likely to</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.600" end="01:02:33.300" style="s2">have led in your water if you&#39;re black I</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.920" end="01:02:35.130" style="s2">also go what about the fact that taxes</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.300" end="01:02:36.900" style="s2">are collected locally and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.130" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">schools and poor neighbourhoods suck</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.900" end="01:02:40.260" style="s2">more than schools in rich neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:41.700" style="s2">what effect does that have on math</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.260" end="01:02:44.130" style="s2">preparedness and what effect does math</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.700" end="01:02:46.560" style="s2">preparedness have on whether people show</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.130" end="01:02:49.980" style="s2">up in biology chemistry mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.560" end="01:02:53.220" style="s2">physics a lot so so those could be read</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.980" end="01:02:55.350" style="s2">as systemic denial of access to stem</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.220" end="01:02:57.360" style="s2">without it being at all at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.350" end="01:02:59.670" style="s2">the universities or what is going on</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.360" end="01:03:02.220" style="s2">within the disciplines of stem right but</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.670" end="01:03:04.770" style="s2">if it&#39;s a societal level inequality</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.220" end="01:03:06.810" style="s2">society I would say it&#39;s just even an</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.770" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">echo of past discrimination that</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.810" end="01:03:09.900" style="s2">separated us into neighborhoods that</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:11.460" style="s2">have different amounts of resource to</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.900" end="01:03:13.200" style="s2">spend on things like schooling and clean</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.460" end="01:03:16.710" style="s2">water all right got another one yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.200" end="01:03:17.850" style="s2">which is that I had this is years ago so</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.710" end="01:03:20.870" style="s2">when we were in graduate school at</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.850" end="01:03:23.430" style="s2">Michigan and we were both teeing</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.870" end="01:03:25.560" style="s2">basically you know intro bio and more</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.430" end="01:03:28.950" style="s2">advanced bio and most of our students</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.560" end="01:03:30.540" style="s2">there were pre-med because at a big you</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.950" end="01:03:32.460" style="s2">know an r1 university like University of</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.540" end="01:03:35.880" style="s2">Michigan most of the biology majors are</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.460" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">pre-med or pre-dental and I had a number</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.880" end="01:03:41.310" style="s2">of black students and in one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:42.930" style="s2">classes I I had you know enough that</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.310" end="01:03:44.790" style="s2">they and they were they all came into</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.930" end="01:03:47.310" style="s2">the class friends with each other and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.790" end="01:03:48.670" style="s2">happened to be all black men well make</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.310" end="01:03:51.819" style="s2">four or five</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.670" end="01:03:54.190" style="s2">in a class of 25 or so and I was it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.819" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">some lab I was overhearing them talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.190" end="01:03:58.119" style="s2">about their plans and they were all</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:59.619" style="s2">going to med school and none of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.119" end="01:04:00.790" style="s2">were looking to go into science which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.619" end="01:04:03.460" style="s2">to say you know that the STEM fields</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.790" end="01:04:05.619" style="s2">medicine isn&#39;t included in stem often</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.460" end="01:04:08.410" style="s2">because it&#39;s seen you know stem is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.619" end="01:04:09.970" style="s2">pursuit of science for Sciences sake or</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.410" end="01:04:11.770" style="s2">engineering technology whereas medicine</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.970" end="01:04:13.809" style="s2">is this implied thing and ended up in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.770" end="01:04:16.119" style="s2">conversation with these young men and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.809" end="01:04:20.140" style="s2">again this is you know 25 years ago at</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.119" end="01:04:22.299" style="s2">this point but when I asked them you</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.140" end="01:04:23.500" style="s2">know why are none of you interested in</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.299" end="01:04:25.540" style="s2">going into science because at least</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.500" end="01:04:27.339" style="s2">three of them as I remember had had you</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.540" end="01:04:29.290" style="s2">know great facility in scientific</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.339" end="01:04:30.970" style="s2">thinking which is different from being</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.290" end="01:04:34.299" style="s2">able to be a good doctor those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.970" end="01:04:36.819" style="s2">completely overlapping things what they</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.299" end="01:04:39.369" style="s2">to a person said and so of course is not</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.819" end="01:04:42.400" style="s2">going to be true of all young black men</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.369" end="01:04:43.990" style="s2">but what they to a person said was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.400" end="01:04:46.660" style="s2">the first person in my family to have</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.990" end="01:04:49.420" style="s2">this opportunity to go to college there</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.660" end="01:04:51.910" style="s2">is no way that I am going to pass up the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.420" end="01:04:53.140" style="s2">opportunity to you know pay off the debt</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.910" end="01:04:56.619" style="s2">that I&#39;m incurring by going to college</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.140" end="01:04:58.930" style="s2">and not be able to make enough money for</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.619" end="01:04:59.770" style="s2">myself and for my parents and for my</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.930" end="01:05:01.750" style="s2">future family</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.770" end="01:05:03.490" style="s2">the fact is medicine pay at that point</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.750" end="01:05:05.559" style="s2">now it&#39;s not so true but you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.490" end="01:05:07.990" style="s2">in the mid-90s medicine pays science</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.559" end="01:05:10.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not nearly as from Unity</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.990" end="01:05:15.250" style="s2">remunerative and it doesn&#39;t guarantee</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.930" end="01:05:17.470" style="s2">you a position from which you can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.250" end="01:05:19.799" style="s2">financially secure and for people who</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.470" end="01:05:22.660" style="s2">were more likely to be coming from</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.799" end="01:05:24.099" style="s2">socio-economic disparities such that no</p>

<p begin="01:05:24.099" end="01:05:27.760" style="s2">financially secure they were making</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.990" end="01:05:29.710" style="s2">choices to go into medicine rather than</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.760" end="01:05:31.420" style="s2">science precisely because of past</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.710" end="01:05:32.890" style="s2">disparities and there were choices in</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.420" end="01:05:34.750" style="s2">this case they were completely choices</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.890" end="01:05:35.980" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t they&#39;re being forced away from</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.750" end="01:05:37.450" style="s2">science into medicine but they were</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.980" end="01:05:39.040" style="s2">choosing to go into medicine because it</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.450" end="01:05:41.109" style="s2">looked like the better financial bet</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.040" end="01:05:44.099" style="s2">yeah it makes total sense so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.109" end="01:05:47.349" style="s2">lots of forces that might result in</p>

<p begin="01:06:00.210" end="01:06:04.410" style="s2">that ultimate pattern of differential</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.570" end="01:06:21.750" style="s2">science it is trying to blind people by</p>

<p begin="01:06:42.240" end="01:06:44.940" style="s2">two more from this one and see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.530" end="01:06:48.390" style="s2">what showed up in the last livestream</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.940" end="01:06:50.100" style="s2">all right okay what would you suggest to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.390" end="01:06:52.080" style="s2">invite people into this conversation who</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.100" end="01:06:54.090" style="s2">might otherwise be right for it but have</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.080" end="01:06:57.080" style="s2">an aversion largely because of things</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.090" end="01:07:01.890" style="s2">like the stigma against Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.080" end="01:07:04.980" style="s2">well I don&#39;t think we can do it on this</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.890" end="01:07:07.620" style="s2">Q&amp;A but I do think the most important</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.980" end="01:07:09.180" style="s2">question the thing that was very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.620" end="01:07:11.880" style="s2">get anyone to pay attention to at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.180" end="01:07:14.310" style="s2">Evergreen meltdown was that there is an</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.880" end="01:07:16.440" style="s2">alternative story there&#39;s a story that</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.310" end="01:07:18.450" style="s2">treats the question of why the</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.440" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">differential representation happens with</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.450" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">full nuance what is it that happened to</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:27.930" style="s2">black America and why right I think that</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:31.470" style="s2">story is it&#39;s horrifying in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.930" end="01:07:33.090" style="s2">but it&#39;s hopeful because it isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.470" end="01:07:36.180" style="s2">thing that people fear so in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.090" end="01:07:38.820" style="s2">we are drowning out a much better more</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.180" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">interesting more tractable problem with</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.820" end="01:07:45.180" style="s2">fairy tales and the question is can we</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:49.380" style="s2">now talk about that alternative can we</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.180" end="01:07:53.280" style="s2">put the BLM version of events up against</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.380" end="01:07:55.320" style="s2">a scientifically robust competitor right</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:07:57.600" style="s2">can we put them head-to-head rather than</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.320" end="01:07:58.500" style="s2">allow one to shut down the other so I</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.600" end="01:08:03.330" style="s2">think we need to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.500" end="01:08:05.790" style="s2">yeah we do I mean I think I&#39;m waiting</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.330" end="01:08:08.220" style="s2">for the new fiction</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.790" end="01:08:09.870" style="s2">that actually does this right you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.220" end="01:08:12.600" style="s2">me you mean the new fiction like the new</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.870" end="01:08:16.410" style="s2">narrator new good compelling deep and</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.600" end="01:08:16.920" style="s2">rich narrative fiction this is we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.410" end="01:08:19.530" style="s2">have time</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.920" end="01:08:20.970" style="s2">slightly no people can write fast good</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.530" end="01:08:22.140" style="s2">good people can write fast I think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.970" end="01:08:24.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve got some excellent documentary</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.140" end="01:08:27.240" style="s2">filmmakers doing some of this work right</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.600" end="01:08:28.770" style="s2">now which is compelling you know that</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.240" end="01:08:31.710" style="s2">they will often I mean like Mike Nina&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.770" end="01:08:34.290" style="s2">the three piece three-part documentary</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.710" end="01:08:35.730" style="s2">really mixes the analysis in with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.290" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">story and that is part of what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.730" end="01:08:41.700" style="s2">compelling about it to people but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:43.500" style="s2">just I&#39;m thinking of another another</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.700" end="01:08:44.790" style="s2">this is not this is like what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.500" end="01:08:49.109" style="s2">rather than what can we do going forward</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.790" end="01:08:51.030" style="s2">but I&#39;m reminded of a moment boy six</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.109" end="01:08:51.569" style="s2">months ago or so when Zach and I went to</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.030" end="01:08:53.910" style="s2">Powell&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.569" end="01:08:56.880" style="s2">this amazing independent gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.910" end="01:08:59.400" style="s2">bookstore in downtown Portland and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.880" end="01:09:02.819" style="s2">were looking for books young adult books</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.400" end="01:09:06.630" style="s2">that Toby our younger son who&#39;s 14 now</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.819" end="01:09:10.020" style="s2">might be interested in and we must have</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.630" end="01:09:14.370" style="s2">wandered the why a the young adult Isles</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.020" end="01:09:16.470" style="s2">for 20 minutes and literally could not</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.370" end="01:09:20.280" style="s2">find a book written in the last 15 years</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.470" end="01:09:21.870" style="s2">that I was willing to take home actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.280" end="01:09:23.819" style="s2">that&#39;s not sure I took one hi was I</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.870" end="01:09:25.109" style="s2">thought one was wonderful and I took it</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.819" end="01:09:27.210" style="s2">home and I thought I&#39;d read it first</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.109" end="01:09:31.380" style="s2">and I got about 50 pages in and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.210" end="01:09:33.690" style="s2">turned super woke and intolerant and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.380" end="01:09:37.049" style="s2">was you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s like a space</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.690" end="01:09:38.940" style="s2">opera that went into some crazy space</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.049" end="01:09:41.549" style="s2">and this is what the entire young adult</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.940" end="01:09:43.460" style="s2">fiction book shelves look like now you</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.549" end="01:09:46.350" style="s2">know you end up having to go back into</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.460" end="01:09:48.030" style="s2">you know I picked up se Hinton yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.350" end="01:09:49.680" style="s2">outsiders and you know some other good</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.030" end="01:09:51.930" style="s2">stuff that you know it tells real</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.680" end="01:10:00.270" style="s2">stories about real characters with real</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.930" end="01:10:03.950" style="s2">trouble and we we could I think have</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.270" end="01:10:06.390" style="s2">some good fiction quickly here but I</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.950" end="01:10:08.820" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.390" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">the stories need to happen you and I are</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.820" end="01:10:13.200" style="s2">in complete agreement that what changes</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:16.110" style="s2">minds is the narrative version not be</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.200" end="01:10:19.050" style="s2">the academic version mm-hmm but the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.110" end="01:10:21.300" style="s2">problem is this is why people burn books</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.050" end="01:10:22.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s all too easy with the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.300" end="01:10:26.130" style="s2">power I mean look if they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.820" end="01:10:31.230" style="s2">science and nature and the Triple A s</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.130" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2">and Caltech two broadcasts fail t to</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.230" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">their anti science agenda then what they</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.320" end="01:10:40.829" style="s2">will do to any narrative that reveals</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:44.340" style="s2">them is they will make it immoral to</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.829" end="01:10:46.949" style="s2">engage it and the people who will engage</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.340" end="01:10:49.790" style="s2">it in that context are people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.949" end="01:10:52.199" style="s2">need it they may enjoy it it may enhance</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.790" end="01:10:53.639" style="s2">their understanding but the peoples is</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.199" end="01:10:57.300" style="s2">one of the powerful things about fiction</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.639" end="01:11:01.710" style="s2">as it sneaks in again I think we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.300" end="01:11:04.290" style="s2">you know if this dies down if something</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.710" end="01:11:07.380" style="s2">happens that turns this around and we</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.290" end="01:11:10.349" style="s2">get another two years you might be able</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.380" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">to get that fiction lodged someplace</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.349" end="01:11:15.420" style="s2">that would do the job but hey I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:19.010" style="s2">mean I see the force that turns around</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.420" end="01:11:22.110" style="s2">we need we need someone who can see this</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.010" end="01:11:25.949" style="s2">high up enough at some someplace like</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.110" end="01:11:32.579" style="s2">Disney all right some someone who could</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.949" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">actually make non woke anti woke but but</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.579" end="01:11:39.300" style="s2">difficult and honest narrative that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:43.829" style="s2">also compelling I mean again you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.300" end="01:11:45.869" style="s2">talking about every institution has this</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.829" end="01:11:48.270" style="s2">battle going on within it if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.869" end="01:11:48.900" style="s2">Twitter and that&#39;s Facebook and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.270" end="01:11:52.020" style="s2">Instagram</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.900" end="01:11:54.389" style="s2">then how exactly does the thing go viral</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.020" end="01:11:56.940" style="s2">if the algorithm decides it doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.389" end="01:11:58.349" style="s2">it well so I we haven&#39;t we didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.940" end="01:12:00.780" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually seen Joker yet so I</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.349" end="01:12:02.369" style="s2">can&#39;t really speak to it but you know I</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.780" end="01:12:04.469" style="s2">saw a lot of the lead-up to it and how</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.369" end="01:12:06.210" style="s2">enraged people were that it was being</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.469" end="01:12:10.079" style="s2">made and the fact is that it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.210" end="01:12:13.800" style="s2">a big hit in part because some people</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.079" end="01:12:15.239" style="s2">anyway are now seeing the outrage as an</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.800" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">indicator that that&#39;s actually some a</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.239" end="01:12:19.739" style="s2">door I want to go through okay so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:22.110" style="s2">maybe encouraging that is like a look</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.739" end="01:12:23.369" style="s2">look look to the outraged mob and see</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.110" end="01:12:25.619" style="s2">what they&#39;re telling you that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.369" end="01:12:27.270" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t look at and look there well</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.619" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a good guide yeah look at what</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.270" end="01:12:29.010" style="s2">they don&#39;t want you to look at that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:31.650" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.010" end="01:12:32.489" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t catch on to the to the you</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.650" end="01:12:34.610" style="s2">know the masses</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.489" end="01:12:37.590" style="s2">but I actually want to take back my</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.610" end="01:12:40.830" style="s2">pessimism because I now in light of what</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.590" end="01:12:42.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve said I now know the path okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.830" end="01:12:46.290" style="s2">what path is that the fiction has to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.840" end="01:12:48.660" style="s2">subversive sure right it has to be the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.290" end="01:12:50.610" style="s2">antidote it has to be the inverse of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.660" end="01:12:52.980" style="s2">Trojan horse as you were describing</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.610" end="01:12:55.890" style="s2">Chloe Val during yeah and the point is</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.980" end="01:12:59.239" style="s2">the fiction that the enemy doesn&#39;t spot</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.890" end="01:13:02.070" style="s2">as subversive of their message but that</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.239" end="01:13:05.130" style="s2">will cause what we used to say the dime</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.070" end="01:13:07.020" style="s2">to drop for people that fiction has a</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.130" end="01:13:11.070" style="s2">tremendous amount of power and so the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.020" end="01:13:13.230" style="s2">question is do we have a do we have</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.070" end="01:13:14.760" style="s2">writers who are clever enough not just</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.230" end="01:13:16.020" style="s2">to write the fiction well that we need</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.760" end="01:13:18.090" style="s2">but to write it in a form that it</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.020" end="01:13:19.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get spotted yeah well I mean and</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.090" end="01:13:22.830" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had it recently you know it</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.860" end="01:13:23.280" style="s2">like this is what the matrix was at some</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.830" end="01:13:24.960" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.280" end="01:13:28.830" style="s2">well the matrix was the allegory of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.960" end="01:13:32.310" style="s2">cave you know but a lot more people than</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.830" end="01:13:35.100" style="s2">Plato do it does yeah oh yeah true um</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.310" end="01:13:36.780" style="s2">and it reached them now rather than 2500</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.100" end="01:13:38.430" style="s2">years ago or whenever whenever Plato was</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.780" end="01:13:44.270" style="s2">probably off by several hundred years</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.430" end="01:13:47.460" style="s2">but thank you Leighton um yeah like but</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.270" end="01:13:47.880" style="s2">nonetheless there is something to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.460" end="01:13:49.920" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.880" end="01:13:52.530" style="s2">you&#39;re right that people do things I</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.920" end="01:13:55.140" style="s2">mean you know part of the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.530" end="01:13:57.480" style="s2">the movie thing is that the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.140" end="01:14:00.360" style="s2">writes movies and then deploys them is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.480" end="01:14:03.420" style="s2">hybrid of some sort of market force and</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.360" end="01:14:04.530" style="s2">some sort of artistic force yeah and in</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.420" end="01:14:06.900" style="s2">order to do what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.530" end="01:14:11.160" style="s2">you really can&#39;t afford it to be market</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.900" end="01:14:15.030" style="s2">driven it has to be driven by by an or</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.160" end="01:14:17.040" style="s2">well-liked figure yeah okay one more</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.030" end="01:14:19.110" style="s2">here over the last several decades</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.040" end="01:14:20.640" style="s2">academia and science have become bad at</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.110" end="01:14:22.980" style="s2">challenging power structures and self</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.640" end="01:14:24.930" style="s2">defense can resistance to irrational</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.980" end="01:14:27.870" style="s2">authority be introduced as part of</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.930" end="01:14:30.090" style="s2">standard scientific training if so how</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.870" end="01:14:32.070" style="s2">this is exactly what we were doing oh</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.090" end="01:14:36.030" style="s2">yeah this is exactly what we were doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.070" end="01:14:39.330" style="s2">and it it got it it has to be like this</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.030" end="01:14:43.260" style="s2">is the scientific method the way that</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.330" end="01:14:45.420" style="s2">you do science is is inherently about</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.260" end="01:14:45.660" style="s2">rejecting irrational authority about</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.420" end="01:14:47.550" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.660" end="01:14:49.500" style="s2">acting any appeal to Authority if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.550" end="01:14:53.880" style="s2">made simply on the basis of this person</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.500" end="01:14:55.650" style="s2">in a lab code made it yeah so in effect</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.880" end="01:14:58.890" style="s2">what this person is saying and I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.650" end="01:15:02.730" style="s2">they&#39;re right on the money is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.890" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">science has become co-opted it has been</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.730" end="01:15:07.950" style="s2">co-opted by market forces which is true</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:09.690" style="s2">those market forces have deviated it</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.950" end="01:15:11.730" style="s2">from the thing that makes it most potent</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.690" end="01:15:14.850" style="s2">which is that in science if you are</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.730" end="01:15:16.710" style="s2">right then you win right you win by</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.850" end="01:15:19.200" style="s2">virtue of having more productive</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.710" end="01:15:22.260" style="s2">predictive power than the alternatives</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.200" end="01:15:24.480" style="s2">and so that thing is the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.260" end="01:15:26.910" style="s2">location for people with problems with</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.480" end="01:15:28.500" style="s2">authority now Heather&#39;s right we were</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.910" end="01:15:29.940" style="s2">doing this at Evergreen it was only</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.500" end="01:15:32.580" style="s2">really possible at Evergreen because</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.940" end="01:15:36.420" style="s2">evergreen because it was founded by</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.580" end="01:15:38.070" style="s2">subversives gave faculty freedom to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.420" end="01:15:40.020" style="s2">what they thought needed to be done</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.070" end="01:15:41.760" style="s2">without any administrator being able to</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.020" end="01:15:43.770" style="s2">tell you you can&#39;t teach that way or you</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.760" end="01:15:45.980" style="s2">have to teach this subject so it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.770" end="01:15:48.510" style="s2">open to that and almost no place is and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.980" end="01:15:52.050" style="s2">evergreen isn&#39;t now anymore either</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.510" end="01:15:53.760" style="s2">so in some sense yeah scientists needs</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.050" end="01:15:56.130" style="s2">to be part of the scientific education</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.760" end="01:16:00.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a weird thing because it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.130" end="01:16:02.940" style="s2">teach people how to resist Authority</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.390" end="01:16:06.510" style="s2">this is why other and I talked so much</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.940" end="01:16:08.520" style="s2">about the necessity that anybody who is</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.510" end="01:16:10.440" style="s2">gonna do high quality thinking have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.520" end="01:16:12.060" style="s2">relationship with some realm where</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.440" end="01:16:15.720" style="s2">whether you succeeded or failed is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.060" end="01:16:17.580" style="s2">there is not decided by an authority</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.720" end="01:16:19.680" style="s2">it&#39;s decided by whether your tower</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.580" end="01:16:22.680" style="s2">stands up or your motor turns over or</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.680" end="01:16:25.170" style="s2">some things there&#39;s a kiln intact or</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.680" end="01:16:26.730" style="s2">your bicycle runs or your table is flat</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.170" end="01:16:28.170" style="s2">all these things you got to have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.730" end="01:16:29.490" style="s2">relationship with one of those realms</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.170" end="01:16:30.720" style="s2">because then it will tell you when the</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.490" end="01:16:32.880" style="s2">authority in front of you isn&#39;t making</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.720" end="01:16:34.290" style="s2">any sense that will tell you actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.880" end="01:16:36.390" style="s2">you should trust you should trust what</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.290" end="01:16:39.690" style="s2">you know rather than oh if the authority</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.390" end="01:16:40.830" style="s2">so so then it&#39;s true yeah okay so I</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.690" end="01:16:42.810" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna try to answer just a</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.830" end="01:16:45.420" style="s2">couple more here there&#39;s a question here</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.810" end="01:16:46.710" style="s2">about the extinction of the Irish elk I</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.420" end="01:16:50.280" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna save that since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.710" end="01:16:55.230" style="s2">not mostly doing that kind of question</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.280" end="01:16:57.080" style="s2">right now turns out so for those who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.230" end="01:16:58.200" style="s2">excited for us to come back to that is</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.080" end="01:17:03.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.200" end="01:17:06.360" style="s2">incredibly antlered beast yep so there</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.480" end="01:17:09.330" style="s2">are a few here asking how can I explain</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.360" end="01:17:11.010" style="s2">what&#39;s going on succinctly how you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.330" end="01:17:12.510" style="s2">what can I say to my friends you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.010" end="01:17:13.410" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the sound bite and I want</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.510" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">to just put that out there I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.410" end="01:17:16.530" style="s2">that&#39;s one one will answer laughs but I</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:19.560" style="s2">want you to look Brett at this one that</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.530" end="01:17:21.350" style="s2">I&#39;ve got highlighted and should I read</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.560" end="01:17:25.080" style="s2">that aloud and should we answer it</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.350" end="01:17:30.530" style="s2">before I tell you guys what that is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.080" end="01:17:34.980" style="s2">do yeah I think this is a this is one</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.530" end="01:17:41.490" style="s2">that should be discussed okay so this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.980" end="01:17:44.550" style="s2">the terrific love you both Eric as well</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.490" end="01:17:46.560" style="s2">are you armed if not I&#39;d like to donate</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.550" end="01:17:50.910" style="s2">a firearm legally of course shipped to</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.560" end="01:17:56.040" style="s2">your nearest gun shop stay safe we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.910" end="01:17:59.820" style="s2">armed and I I don&#39;t like that we feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.040" end="01:18:05.310" style="s2">like we have to be that that feels like</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.820" end="01:18:06.930" style="s2">a major loss already but a I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.310" end="01:18:12.420" style="s2">there&#39;s something that needs to be said</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.930" end="01:18:15.050" style="s2">which is at the moment we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.420" end="01:18:18.630" style="s2">got a violent mob in the streets</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.050" end="01:18:20.970" style="s2">demonstrating how much power it has so</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.630" end="01:18:22.860" style="s2">far my understanding is it has pretty</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.970" end="01:18:25.710" style="s2">well stayed out of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.860" end="01:18:29.580" style="s2">neighborhoods I believe it is stayed out</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.710" end="01:18:30.960" style="s2">of people&#39;s neighborhoods because of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.580" end="01:18:32.370" style="s2">Second Amendment and this is not what</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.960" end="01:18:33.960" style="s2">the Second Amendment was written for</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.370" end="01:18:35.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not really about personal</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.960" end="01:18:38.580" style="s2">protection it&#39;s a hedge against tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.820" end="01:18:42.720" style="s2">but I think the gun control debate now</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.580" end="01:18:45.870" style="s2">has to include the observation that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.720" end="01:18:48.420" style="s2">rational fear that people who would like</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.870" end="01:18:51.750" style="s2">the law suspended will have of entering</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.420" end="01:18:55.980" style="s2">people&#39;s neighborhoods is it may very</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.750" end="01:19:03.050" style="s2">well be what is preventing people from</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.980" end="01:19:05.880" style="s2">engaging in the violent up ending of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.050" end="01:19:09.170" style="s2">people at home or their neighborhoods so</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.880" end="01:19:12.150" style="s2">in any case what I would say is yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.170" end="01:19:15.320" style="s2">we are armed I think I gave a</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.150" end="01:19:17.489" style="s2">a glib response somebody weaker to back</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.320" end="01:19:19.409" style="s2">asked if it was a good time to buy guns</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.489" end="01:19:21.000" style="s2">and I said no because the lines the gun</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.409" end="01:19:23.460" style="s2">stars are too long they have it because</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.000" end="01:19:25.140" style="s2">the supply is too low and the demand is</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.460" end="01:19:26.580" style="s2">too high but the demand is really high</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.140" end="01:19:28.920" style="s2">for a reason because the people are</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.580" end="01:19:31.380" style="s2">rightly frightened they&#39;re watching well</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.920" end="01:19:33.420" style="s2">this was before before the last two</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.380" end="01:19:35.000" style="s2">weeks this is at the point that lock</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.420" end="01:19:37.409" style="s2">downs were beginning to hurry out and</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.000" end="01:19:38.489" style="s2">and people were legitimately questioned</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.409" end="01:19:39.150" style="s2">whether or not supply chains would</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.489" end="01:19:42.840" style="s2">remain intact</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.150" end="01:19:44.219" style="s2">and what what potentially months of lock</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.840" end="01:19:45.900" style="s2">downs would do to people&#39;s psychologies</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.219" end="01:19:47.400" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.900" end="01:19:50.219" style="s2">seeing right now where we&#39;re seeing it</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.400" end="01:19:52.590" style="s2">just exactly what we feared and it</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.219" end="01:19:55.890" style="s2">hasn&#39;t you know can easily get far worse</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.590" end="01:19:57.290" style="s2">so anyway I would say if you are in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.890" end="01:20:00.260" style="s2">position we were in and you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.290" end="01:20:02.640" style="s2">should I or shouldn&#39;t I I would say</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.260" end="01:20:05.250" style="s2">unfortunately given that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.640" end="01:20:06.929" style="s2">how this plays out and we can see what</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.250" end="01:20:10.080" style="s2">it&#39;s doing and how quickly it is growing</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.929" end="01:20:15.210" style="s2">and demonstrating its power I would be</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.080" end="01:20:16.800" style="s2">hard-pressed to tell you not to buy some</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.210" end="01:20:18.659" style="s2">weapons I would also say I know how to</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.800" end="01:20:20.880" style="s2">use them you absolutely want to know how</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.659" end="01:20:24.390" style="s2">to use them and you want to know how to</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.880" end="01:20:28.340" style="s2">store them and so you know gun safe is</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.390" end="01:20:32.130" style="s2">the way to go all right final question</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.340" end="01:20:37.650" style="s2">for tonight today whatever it is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.130" end="01:20:39.360" style="s2">know how long we&#39;ve been here yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.650" end="01:20:41.010" style="s2">asked one version of it but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.360" end="01:20:42.210" style="s2">this one I&#39;m struggling to explain to</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.010" end="01:20:44.100" style="s2">well-meaning friends what is really</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.210" end="01:20:46.110" style="s2">going on here with these protests on BLM</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.100" end="01:20:47.909" style="s2">they are fully bought into the guilt and</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.110" end="01:20:49.949" style="s2">shaming narrative what can I tell them</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.909" end="01:20:51.510" style="s2">and someone else I think it was someone</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.949" end="01:20:52.050" style="s2">else me was the same person asked you</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.510" end="01:20:54.750" style="s2">know what</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.050" end="01:20:56.820" style="s2">what&#39;s a succinct description of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.750" end="01:20:58.620" style="s2">and you know this this the answer could</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.820" end="01:21:00.390" style="s2">then feed into and like who do you who</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.620" end="01:21:03.780" style="s2">do you point people to like you know I</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.390" end="01:21:06.030" style="s2">get especially given that the mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.780" end="01:21:08.580" style="s2">media did a really solid job of</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.030" end="01:21:10.199" style="s2">convincing a whole swath of the public</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.580" end="01:21:13.080" style="s2">that Jordan Peterson for instance was</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.199" end="01:21:17.010" style="s2">some kind of outright loon well which</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.080" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">he&#39;s obviously not so well I was just</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.010" end="01:21:20.940" style="s2">gonna say this is this was my point</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:23.010" style="s2">earlier about the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.940" end="01:21:24.659" style="s2">predicted what happened the stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.010" end="01:21:26.159" style="s2">caught other people off-guard but has</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.659" end="01:21:27.869" style="s2">been predicted by some</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.159" end="01:21:29.429" style="s2">some who predicted it you ought to</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.869" end="01:21:31.260" style="s2">listen to them you ought to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.429" end="01:21:35.639" style="s2">how they did that trick right Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.260" end="01:21:38.459" style="s2">Peterson predicted that people were</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.639" end="01:21:40.280" style="s2">going to be compelled by courts to use</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.459" end="01:21:45.300" style="s2">certain language and that the threat of</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.280" end="01:21:47.729" style="s2">losing your freedom was going to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.300" end="01:21:49.559" style="s2">invoked right he was right about that so</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.729" end="01:21:53.010" style="s2">if you&#39;ve been told that Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.559" end="01:21:54.869" style="s2">is an all right gateway drug or</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.010" end="01:21:57.749" style="s2">something like that you had it wrong</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.869" end="01:21:59.369" style="s2">somebody lied to you and now you can go</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.749" end="01:21:59.789" style="s2">back and fix it you can go see what he</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.369" end="01:22:02.300" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.789" end="01:22:08.459" style="s2">likewise for us you might have been told</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.300" end="01:22:11.280" style="s2">we were racists who you know weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.459" end="01:22:12.780" style="s2">interested in seeing oppression of black</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.280" end="01:22:15.929" style="s2">people and or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.780" end="01:22:17.820" style="s2">well you relied to now you know we</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.929" end="01:22:19.769" style="s2">predicted a lot about what and what is</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.820" end="01:22:21.300" style="s2">unfolding in our streets right now so</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.769" end="01:22:23.579" style="s2">you can go back to those things and if</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.300" end="01:22:25.019" style="s2">you follow the people who&#39;ve gotten it</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.579" end="01:22:26.729" style="s2">right you&#39;ll find they&#39;re connected to</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.019" end="01:22:28.289" style="s2">other people who got it right and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.729" end="01:22:30.539" style="s2">can sort of bootstrap your way there in</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.289" end="01:22:32.489" style="s2">terms of what you say to your friends</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.539" end="01:22:35.070" style="s2">who are thoroughly ensconced in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.489" end="01:22:36.900" style="s2">stuff and I&#39;m not promising promising</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.070" end="01:22:40.829" style="s2">you it&#39;s gonna work because as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.900" end="01:22:44.189" style="s2">said elsewhere and here many times these</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.829" end="01:22:45.749" style="s2">crises reveal character your friends may</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.189" end="01:22:47.039" style="s2">have a character defect that is going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.749" end="01:22:49.709" style="s2">cause them to become pawns of this</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.039" end="01:22:52.590" style="s2">movement and if they can&#39;t be awakened</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.709" end="01:22:54.959" style="s2">from that zombie state then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.590" end="01:22:58.860" style="s2">probably the moment that you need to go</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.959" end="01:23:01.769" style="s2">find better friends but if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.860" end="01:23:04.289" style="s2">try to see if you can wake them up the</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.769" end="01:23:06.510" style="s2">answer is look if you capitulate to this</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.289" end="01:23:10.679" style="s2">if you start broadcasting it you are</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.510" end="01:23:12.809" style="s2">actually adding firepower that will be</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.679" end="01:23:14.189" style="s2">used against other good people right</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.809" end="01:23:17.340" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna come for the next people</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.189" end="01:23:19.739" style="s2">if you are surrendering to this in order</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.340" end="01:23:21.209" style="s2">to solve your own problem you are making</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.739" end="01:23:22.650" style="s2">a worse problem for other people and</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.209" end="01:23:24.289" style="s2">that&#39;s not your right and if you say</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.650" end="01:23:27.209" style="s2">that to people and they stare you down</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.289" end="01:23:28.530" style="s2">walk away but they don&#39;t that&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.209" end="01:23:29.519" style="s2">think this is responsive because people</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.530" end="01:23:30.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.519" end="01:23:32.400" style="s2">doing well then you have to make it</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.900" end="01:23:34.649" style="s2">clear well but that&#39;s that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.400" end="01:23:36.539" style="s2">question is how is what do you say how</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.649" end="01:23:38.860" style="s2">is it that you make it clear that this</p>

<p begin="01:27:27.360" end="01:27:34.140" style="s2">moment is so serious that that actually</p>

<p begin="01:29:42.900" end="01:29:45.870" style="s2">our colleagues stood up for us when you</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.460" end="01:29:48.330" style="s2">know only our students and a few</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.870" end="01:29:50.010" style="s2">handfuls a few handful of staff faculty</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.330" end="01:29:52.260" style="s2">and admin stood up for us whenever green</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.010" end="01:29:53.640" style="s2">broke but that does leave me with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.260" end="01:29:55.230" style="s2">sense that actually I do think people</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.640" end="01:29:56.520" style="s2">are up to this I really do I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.230" end="01:29:58.740" style="s2">people are up to this but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.520" end="01:30:00.630" style="s2">how to do it in short in short periods</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.740" end="01:30:02.640" style="s2">of time but I mean I don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.630" end="01:30:06.300" style="s2">disagreeing okay if you have somebody</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.640" end="01:30:08.430" style="s2">for three months full-time can you reach</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.300" end="01:30:09.810" style="s2">them sure most of these people are</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.430" end="01:30:12.000" style="s2">reachable under those circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.810" end="01:30:12.670" style="s2">people can&#39;t reach them so I mean the I</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.000" end="01:30:14.590" style="s2">think this</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.670" end="01:30:16.120" style="s2">like most faculty suck at what they do</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.590" end="01:30:18.340" style="s2">yeah and they don&#39;t give a damn about</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.120" end="01:30:19.960" style="s2">their students either and so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.340" end="01:30:21.130" style="s2">manage to and then they claimed they</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.960" end="01:30:22.870" style="s2">weren&#39;t bothering to and Lucy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.130" end="01:30:24.160" style="s2">also true don&#39;t bother to reach students</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.870" end="01:30:25.989" style="s2">and so that gives the sense it</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.160" end="01:30:27.670" style="s2">reinforces the sense that most people</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.989" end="01:30:31.690" style="s2">are unreachable because most people are</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.670" end="01:30:33.280" style="s2">unreached okay but not even sure what</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.690" end="01:30:35.050" style="s2">we&#39;re what we&#39;re disagreeing about here</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.280" end="01:30:37.510" style="s2">because at some level I&#39;m not arguing</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.050" end="01:30:39.820" style="s2">that if you could rerun these people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.510" end="01:30:41.620" style="s2">developmental experience that they</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.820" end="01:30:44.170" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be immune to this I believe</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.620" end="01:30:45.640" style="s2">anybody could have a developmental</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.170" end="01:30:47.739" style="s2">experience that would cause you to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.640" end="01:30:50.739" style="s2">immune to this madness but given where</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.739" end="01:30:52.179" style="s2">we are in 2020 these people have had the</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.739" end="01:30:55.150" style="s2">experiences they have that are making</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.179" end="01:30:57.699" style="s2">them ultra vulnerable to this can you</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.150" end="01:30:59.560" style="s2">wake your friends well your friends are</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.699" end="01:31:01.330" style="s2">who they are arriving at this moment</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.560" end="01:31:04.480" style="s2">could you wake your friends if you had</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.330" end="01:31:06.660" style="s2">you know a year with them off somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.480" end="01:31:08.739" style="s2">where they were insulated from bad</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.660" end="01:31:12.010" style="s2">messages over social media</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.739" end="01:31:16.260" style="s2">sure potentially but can you wake</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.010" end="01:31:19.449" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s you know who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.260" end="01:31:22.120" style="s2">espousing these nonsense beliefs now as</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.449" end="01:31:23.620" style="s2">a result of some mixture of they sound</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.120" end="01:31:25.360" style="s2">right to them and they are afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.620" end="01:31:27.610" style="s2">what happens if they say anything else</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.360" end="01:31:30.160" style="s2">are those people reachable know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.610" end="01:31:33.429" style="s2">been zombified right I&#39;m not declaring</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.160" end="01:31:36.300" style="s2">them unrecoverable at all I&#39;m saying can</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.429" end="01:31:39.880" style="s2">you with your tools now reach them</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.300" end="01:31:43.719" style="s2">probably not in most cases but the</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.880" end="01:31:47.290" style="s2">really important question is what is the</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.719" end="01:31:49.270" style="s2">right use of your time and your effort</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.290" end="01:31:52.410" style="s2">all right and the right use at this</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.270" end="01:31:55.449" style="s2">moment if you are facing this problem is</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.410" end="01:31:58.900" style="s2">figure out who&#39;s gonna break the right</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.449" end="01:32:00.880" style="s2">way and be it&#39;s not totally bleak right</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.900" end="01:32:03.610" style="s2">the people who will break the right way</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.880" end="01:32:06.910" style="s2">have strength of character they&#39;re high</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.610" end="01:32:08.320" style="s2">quality people and so anyway I think if</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.910" end="01:32:09.610" style="s2">you know somebody&#39;s asking us this</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.320" end="01:32:12.730" style="s2">question what should I do</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.610" end="01:32:14.440" style="s2">my honest advice at least for my part my</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.730" end="01:32:18.160" style="s2">honest advice is you could figure out</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.440" end="01:32:22.210" style="s2">who is capable of being awakened from</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.160" end="01:32:23.710" style="s2">this awaken them and then make your</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.210" end="01:32:24.949" style="s2">peace with what happens with the others</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.710" end="01:32:27.590" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.949" end="01:32:30.170" style="s2">you know you could invest your you could</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.590" end="01:32:32.900" style="s2">invest almost all of your effort in</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.170" end="01:32:35.869" style="s2">trying to wake everybody who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.900" end="01:32:38.959" style="s2">seeing it and have very little impact</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.869" end="01:32:41.929" style="s2">and at the moment you do need to think</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.959" end="01:32:44.719" style="s2">about how you&#39;re going to protect</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.929" end="01:32:46.909" style="s2">yourself in all meanings of that term</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.719" end="01:32:48.800" style="s2">you know how are you gonna survive in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.909" end="01:32:50.889" style="s2">world where every institution is being</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.800" end="01:32:53.389" style="s2">taken over by people who say this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.889" end="01:32:54.739" style="s2">well either you&#39;re gonna say it too and</p>

<p begin="01:32:54.739" end="01:32:58.400" style="s2">well enough in the future world or</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.749" end="01:33:00.979" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna stand up and say what you</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.400" end="01:33:03.429" style="s2">know to be accurate and then you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.979" end="01:33:05.739" style="s2">know what world you&#39;re living in so I</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.429" end="01:33:09.099" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m not giving up on humanity</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.739" end="01:33:14.809" style="s2">obviously but I at the present moment</p>
