<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">so yeah if all moved play what was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">question about evolving</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">play well just tell us about it what</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">what is it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">uh yeah tell us tell us all about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">yeah so the basic idea of evolving play</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">human beings can evolve to be sedentary</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">one of the fundamental problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">have in the current world</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">is lack of movement um but that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">evolved</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">to learn and acquire movement to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">experience movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">plot through play animals that have</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">uh that have almost all animals have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">move in order to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">survive right uh actually they acquire a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">lot of their movement skill through play</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">as juveniles</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">the more more kind of really complex an</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">animal is actually the more it plays</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">human beings play more than any other</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">animals somehow our culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">has has forgotten that and has started</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">to view play as very</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">endless and whimsical and as not part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">the important</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">aspects of development something that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">need to recover</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">was the idea behind the name um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">evolved quite a bit since i</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">originated it so i had been doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">parkour</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">so i started involvement play in 2013.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">parkour at that since 2005 so eight</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">even a year into my parkour training i</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">had uh discovered</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">an older french method called nato</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">natural which included not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">running jumping vaulting etc but also</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">included</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">swimming um lifting caring</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">throwing and self-defense i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">interested right away</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">in bringing all these things together in</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">one method</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">um the gymnastics background martial</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">arts background and i wanted to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">um have a method that incorporated all</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">so i actually started developing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">antecedents involved move play back in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">2006 2007</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">um but i was working with with what</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">movement and the founder of what became</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">move now i didn&#39;t feel that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">project was quite going where i wanted i</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">felt like part of it was there was no</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">fun art in what what we created that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">uh either of us had mastery of so i</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">decided that parkour was where i was</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">going to focus and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">and reach a level of mastery that could</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">give me an insight into</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">that process that i could carry into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">broader discipline so i stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">parkour until 2013</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">um and then i and then by that time i</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">run into all the play research and i had</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">brought that play orientation to it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">i&#39;d run into ido portal and the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">around movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">brought that into it and so i was</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">teaching</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">and and doing all this stuff with the</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">and i i noticed this interesting trend</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">which was that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">i was very scientifically minded and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">did a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">primary research on mechanics and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">strength conditioning on how people you</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">know evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">and i would share stuff about that so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">people could understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">better how to move people appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">that about me the education that i</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">brought</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">i noticed that as i wove my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">story into my teachings that had a much</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">bigger impact on me</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">um so i i started to see this power of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:23.120" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">and ask myself what&#39;s going on there how</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.120" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">do i understand that better</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">i i can&#39;t remember actually if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">friend of mine or if it was just</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">youtube but one way or another in</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">october of 2016 like i suspect many of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">you in the room</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">um i was exposed to jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">um through his interview on the joe</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">rogan podcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">and i was interested in the political</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">aspect of what he was talking about but</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">as he got into</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">maps of meaning and his archetypes i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">eyes really lit up and i got very</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">so it just happens because i teach</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">primarily outdoors that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:02.880" style="s2">really teach any that i haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.880" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">november and um march</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">from november to march instead of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">listening to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">um instead of listening to podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">about strength conditioning and reading</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">things about strength conditioning i</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">consumed</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">everything that jordan peterson uh had</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">put out that i could i</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">i was by by</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:29.599" style="s2">march when i taught my first summer i</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">think i&#39;d listen to 160 hours of just</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">uh personality and maps and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">lectures um</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">completely when i went to t and i kept</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">my asking myself this question like</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">why am i obsessed with this guy&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">what does it have to do with my work</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">um and i went out to teach</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">march and all of a sudden i saw that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">this evolutionary frame</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">i was applying to movement and how</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">movement could impact you as a human</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:56.160" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">actually very much aligned with this</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:07:58.879" style="s2">sort of evolutionary frame</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">that peterson was looking at human</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.879" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">behavior in general from</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">you can map them very close to each</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">other that was very</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">interesting because as interesting as it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t until i was actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">teaching a workshop i would start</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:13.759" style="s2">talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">that would trigger something i</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.759" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">remembered from having</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">listened to peterson and i would see the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">connection between became clear</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">why it was so interesting to me the act</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">actually um i i</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">dug very deep into his work and into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">question of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">meaning and um and i that i ended up</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">uh it was people in the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">and started to had have independently</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">been really</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">uh running into a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">world of nature connection which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">obviously related to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">the natural parkour element of what i do</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">and uh and and so these things were</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">coming together</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">and then i found verveicky&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">started talking fakie and his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">the ecology of practices really hit home</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">for me and described what i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">organically grown through</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">my workshops and research so we&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">to think of what we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">as essentially a system</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">of self-transformation right or an</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">ecology of practices where we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">an ecology of practices that afford</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">transformation jerome potential for</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">greatness</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">and service of the good and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">you do that with with what we think of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">as the primary connections that people</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">need which are connection to their body</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">and movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">action to um community connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">natural environment of connection to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">there&#39;s four pillars in what we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:54.000" style="s2">our idea of what the greatness is is we</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.000" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">facilitate the capacity to see clearly</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">the world okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">as it is which is kind of the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">of horus</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">and we need to be able to have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">articulate</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">what we see and develop knowledge out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">it which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">we use socrates as our archetype for</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">that we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">develop have to cultivate in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">with strength physically and emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">to utilize that knowledge we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">she&#39;s intellectual with a giant ear and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">a shrunken natural body</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">want to actually embody these things um</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">we need strength we need emotional</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">courage to do that and so for us</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.760" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">strength is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">is is the you know the archetype is uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">or hercules and the emotional archetype</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">is against socrates or the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">and then um then you need skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">we we love that the celtic god luke as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">representation of skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">have skills to apply to solving these</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">problems all of that helps you solve</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">that anomaly that can</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">happen at any time in your life that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">helps you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">engage in that that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">transcendence and meaning in your life</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">we gain meaning from uh from</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">being connected to things that give</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">meaning to life and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">gain meaning through oriented in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">process of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">uh the most heroic version of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s quite a long answer so i hope</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">oh yes that that was great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">fascinating now now</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">you&#39;re i mean your your work is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">obviously very physical and it demands</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">sort of peak physical fitness and now</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">not everybody is not everybody is</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">what do you say to the people who who</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">aren&#39;t ready to</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">jump through trees and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">use the the world as their jungle gym</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">how would you apply how would</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">how could they apply what your methods</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">and what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">without having a method is actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">designed for</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">all levels for all physical levels the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:09.680" style="s2">expression of it that you see</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">within me um is you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.680" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">someone perhaps at the peak of physical</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:20.399" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t matter so much right</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:22.160" style="s2">so i can jump between two tree branches</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.399" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">say 30 feet off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.160" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">um for me that&#39;s a useful thing because</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">i&#39;ve conditioned myself in many ways and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">provides an edge i can sharpen myself on</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">um but as far as its passage to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">transform me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">no more profound um at least not in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">fundamental way somebody who&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">unfit</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">doing their first jump at ground level</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:51.519" style="s2">that that moment of the jump is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">formative to them</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.519" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re aimed at is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">transformation of the character</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">through the the means of the and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the case you know it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">much about</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">much you can accomplish that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">we love that and we care about it but</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">ultimately the the value of the journey</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">isn&#39;t measured in the heights of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">physical achievements</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">dude and how much change you can make or</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">profoundly changes</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">that individual&#39;s character so our</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">students range in</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">age from three years old to 73 years old</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.279" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">and we&#39;ve had people who are um</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">extremely overweight people who have not</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">trained</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">uh you know in 20 years 30 years or 40</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">actually one of our regular students in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">our classes is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">recovering from a traumatic brain injury</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">so you know he&#39;s gone from</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">really being able to lift up his left</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">leg to being able to do step vaults and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">crawl under branches and little bits of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">climbing</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">for me it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">where you start from not addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">as part of your self-transformation</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">practice</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:13.839" style="s2">importance here you</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:15.519" style="s2">are a body and you can&#39;t escape it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.839" end="00:14:17.440" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have that integrated into</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.519" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">your self-transformation practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.440" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">um it can never be what it could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a great answer yeah and certainly</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">john reiki the one was the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">being and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">and the other was pragmatic value versus</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">objective truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">and i was wondering if you connect those</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">objective truth versus pragmatic value</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">and i was wondering if you connect those</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">dots at all and if you do then how</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">i haven&#39;t thought about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">between the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">of being orientation and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">orientation</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">and how that relates to um</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">to a objective worldview versus a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">pragmatic worldview</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">sort of about uh parkour and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.559" end="00:17:08.400" style="s2">circumambulation and cultural landmarks</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">or national monuments</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.400" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">i was wondering if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">considered</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">having a course that truly moves all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">way around</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">a central object and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:24.400" style="s2">i know that afterwards you often go into</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">campfires or other</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.400" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">ways of dialoguing about the experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">and i&#39;m just wondering how those can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">brought at a local level</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">i live in beautiful arizona i can think</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">of places</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">that i could take you in all the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:41.039" style="s2">around a mountain</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">and then we could go on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.039" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">mountain and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">going all the way around that mountain</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">things like that so</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re interested in in the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">of how</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">kind of having a completed journey um</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">would provide a a a capacity for insight</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:04.120" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">having yeah that&#39;s it uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.120" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">circumambulation peterson has talked</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">about the church where a maze</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">you have to go through all quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">before you&#39;re allowed into the center of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">so you kind of walk the journey for</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">everyone and it allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">see it from any angles many perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">interesting i mean it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">that we do within</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">parkour right parkour tends to be about</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:32.559" style="s2">um very kind of resource dense</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">areas that offer a lot of um</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">a lot of potential to explore movement</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">um i like to think about parkour</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">as being kind of a terrain based sport</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">mountain biking and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">you know downhill skiing freestyle</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">skiing surfing etc</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">are it&#39;s about finding these areas that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">offer lots of potential for women</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">and then exploring them</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.520" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">starting my daughter stacking in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">background um</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">so um we do within my work do some</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:14.720" style="s2">longer movements like at our big</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">retreat we do a big journey around</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">um an alpine area</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">do what&#39;s called the chain lakes trail</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">all the way around it</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">but i&#39;ve never specifically tried to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">think about that from a ritual stamp</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">thing that i&#39;ve been with a lot recently</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">is just starting to think about in my</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">work is the role of ritual</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">if you guys have already uh i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">some of you have read maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">and they have that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">um he has that description of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:50.840" style="s2">of knowledge right we move from</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">exploratory behavior</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.840" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">to imitation of that exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">play to um ritual</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">and from ritual to narrative and drama</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">or drama and narrative literature and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">only later into philosophy and very late</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">into something like science</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">and i notice a commonality with that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">essentially how movement behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">generated</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">you can look at a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">are just starting to learn parkour and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">they&#39;ll go to an area</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">they will start exploring that area</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">and then over time they&#39;ll start to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">notice some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">movement sequence or movement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">particularly intriguing and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">repeat that movement often</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">one person will find a movement and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">other people will then adopt the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">movement that they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">once that movement is starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">well controlled</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">you&#39;ll see is people start adding</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">variation to it a lot of what play is is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">essentially taking a behavior that is uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">that has shown that it&#39;s adaptive and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.559" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">adding variations to it because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">builds your behavior flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">in some sense all of parkour is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">play because you&#39;re you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">but you can see even within it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">this it&#39;s the same sequence</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">um now at our big retreats we</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">we do this climb through a waterfall and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">it&#39;s at the end of the third or fourth</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">day it&#39;s kind of the peak</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">of the event and we you know we</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">run down this creek for about two hours</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">to get to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">waterfall and usually people have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">moving that day for about</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">seven or eight hours by the time we get</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">to the waterfall</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:39.880" style="s2">and they have to climb through this</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">waterfall and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.880" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a tunnel and a rock it&#39;s a chimney</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">basically that you&#39;re stemming up</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">through as the water is pouring down on</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">your head</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s really no way to completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">prepare someone for getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">in there because you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">experienced anything like it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">um and there&#39;s no way to describe it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">i can&#39;t really take you in there and do</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">it with you you have to go through it</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">so i think of that as kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">initiation ritual that we use</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.039" style="s2">um and so we welcome everybody and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">kind of like being reborn through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.039" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">and so i think about this idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">as a ritual but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">lately i&#39;ve been thinking about the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">ritual there that there&#39;s ways of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">the the rituals to make them more</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">um and we&#39;re kind of a discovering</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">ritual within our practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">but we don&#39;t necessarily have the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">technology that um that traditional</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">religions have or shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">shamanic traditions have and so i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">interested in like</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">i&#39;ve thought about the idea of fasting</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">for 24 hours and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">going to do this ritual um i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">some very very intense physical stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:22:59.600" style="s2">to put myself into an altered state and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">then going through it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.600" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">and then using that as a as a as an</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">generation tool i don&#39;t know if that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">precisely along the same lines of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">you&#39;re asking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">um that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">where we&#39;re thinking about about uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">about ritual coming into our practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">but i&#39;d just like to pick up on that for</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">a second so so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how much you you&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">looking at john&#39;s idea of the religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">not a religion i&#39;ve thought that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">you know he talks a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">importance of ritual and rituals that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">can be borrowed from other traditions</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">you know it seems to me that for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:42.240" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion to really</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">take off</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">it needs to have its own rituals you</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">know new rituals that have been designed</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">specifically for it you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">modern day</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">um is much less sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">delivers a lot less value</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">it feels like it to to adopt the two</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">worlds mythology</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">requires me to fudge my epistemology</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.520" end="00:26:25.039" style="s2">so in the event i guess i&#39;m very much in</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">what i notice is that within some of</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">it seems like there are there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">are emerging</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting to me you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">perhaps this is my bias</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">perhaps i&#39;m seeing how when you get a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">new car you see that car everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">maybe because i&#39;ve looked at all this</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">stuff i see this in all sorts of people</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">lots of people within the parkour</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">community got interested in jordan</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">or going into taoism or going into</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:18.559" style="s2">buddhism it&#39;s like there&#39;s an incipit</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">spirituality i think there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.559" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">incipient spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">spiritual element to almost every</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">really gives you deep access to flow</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">state i think perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">mental states that are associated with</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">spiritual and religious experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">very close</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">those states so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s already happening there</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">uh this is something that we need</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">they&#39;re a way to leverage that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">to to build those pieces that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">missing</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve been to christian services and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">been through the rituals</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">and for me they were uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">felt very empty and dead</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">and yet seeing people who have profound</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">experiences from them</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;m seeing those same types</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">through some of these movement</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">events um and other events like them</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">so i i think the role of ritual is is</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:26.399" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">something that i don&#39;t feel like i have</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">fully grocked yet</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">right and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">that&#39;s understandable uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">rituals evolved over</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">over many many years and we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">about creating them</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">you know on purpose just you know from</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">scratch</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s a lot of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">around here is talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">what it could look like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">a lot of brainstorming going on right</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">yeah yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">bias on that i guess is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:12.960" style="s2">it seems to me as inheritors of the west</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">that a lot of the grammar that is going</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.960" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">easiest for us to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">to kind of function on</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">is going to come from a christian</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">framework actually i honestly believe</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not 100 certain about this because i</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">don&#39;t know i&#39;ve been very influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">peterson and i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">spent the same amount of time studying</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">taoism or buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">or some of these other traditions it</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">seems to me that what verveiki has</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">has articulated and what piercing have</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">articulated about</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">the kind of core idea of christianity</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">you know when i talked about the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">we wrote out this this whole roadmap</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">to do uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">what we were trying to create with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:20.399" style="s2">bald move play and we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">idea we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.399" end="00:30:24.640" style="s2">with vision capacity to articulate we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">need to create people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">strong physically and emotionally we</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">need to create people who have skills</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">that they can apply to solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">um what i realized as i was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">that was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:38.799" style="s2">i could describe someone who is great</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">and evil</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.799" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">as well as if you describe someone who</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">is great and good</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.880" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">that if you are pursuing something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">without looking beyond it towards the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">um don&#39;t know what you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:58.399" style="s2">empowering in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">so for me the good has to be in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">uh capacity for agape and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">the funny thing about that is that hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">my practice of building agape in myself</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">is buddhist right i use meta meditation</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">which is part of the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">practices that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">john uses it was taught to me my friend</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">mark walsh</p>

<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">that&#39;s all right not a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">the highest the highest good is is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">agape principle i use buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.399" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">i think that the story of christ</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:49.440" style="s2">archetypally is the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">expression of that that i&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">encountered</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">i think in taoism and buddhism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">amount of wealth of wisdom that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">actually very</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">alignable with that basic region</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:07.720" style="s2">but where i where i get stuck is i</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">cannot accept</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.720" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">epistemologically commitment to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">yeah thank you that&#39;s a great answer and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:28.159" style="s2">children</p>

<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">a question</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">um i was i was this is a bit lighter of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">a question but</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">i was wondering if you ever came across</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">the tricking community</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">yes nice</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know that much about tricking</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">um you know obviously</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">obviously lots of parkour athletes</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">adopted pre-runners have adopted tricks</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">from the tricking community</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:05.519" style="s2">right so we&#39;ve learned lots of tricks</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">like one of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.519" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">core techniques that i&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">right now that i just sort of started to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">be able to land consistently as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">corkscrew</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">which is really nice um</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">yeah i saw you do a webster in the uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">the little video that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">uh someone posted in our our chat and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">it got me thinking um</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s great i</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of crossover between</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">the communities and was curious</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">um interestingly my um</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">the guy who i kind of my my core</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">business partner</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">you know my number one tenant in what</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">uh he he he&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">has a strong tricking background he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">kind of a free runner who likes lots of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">tricking and he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:58.480" style="s2">a um a devout christian so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">an interesting intention for us because</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.480" end="00:34:04.080" style="s2">i&#39;m a very like traditionally pure</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">parkour guy and an atheist and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.080" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">christian so yeah there was</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">there was all that drama way back in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">day uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">when the two communities started really</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">interacting with each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">um i guess the other question i had is</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">somewhat related to that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">um you know i was doing this uh tricking</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">as a as a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:33.679" style="s2">and uh you know i&#39;m 30 now</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">and i still keep up the basics but um</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.679" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t have a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">cartilage left in my knees to work with</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">uh and so i was wondering as someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">who&#39;s done these practices</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">for a long time um how</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">you have learned how to offset</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">some of the damage that one can take</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">keeping up a regular practice of a more</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">extreme sport</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:00.839" style="s2">yeah oh you know this is a story i tell</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">uh i kind of adopted the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">the framework of professional athletics</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">give a sense of meaning and purpose to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">my parkour and the initial um</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">excitement of it isn&#39;t working for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:22.640" style="s2">and you know i started i</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">started some of the first competitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.640" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">parkour</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">events in north america and in the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:31.920" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:34.960" style="s2">and i uh i was competing in them at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">same time that i was running them</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.960" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">i was like dieting down to get lean</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">enough to to to be like an optimal body</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">weight because i&#39;m a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">guy naturally um you know most parkour</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">athletes are between like 140</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">panic attack</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">my first competition um and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">few other things going on in my life but</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">over the course of 18 months i</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">had uh subluxated my cuboid bone</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">toward ligaments in both my feet two</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">back spasms</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">tore an old rotator cuff injury</p>

<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">microclavicular separation</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">and um and my achilles tendon</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">and then a little like a high ankle</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:23.839" style="s2">sprain and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">um you know that up</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.839" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">then that all happened between like i</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:32.160" style="s2">guess 27</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">but then i kind of lost my motivation</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">for it and i was coming back</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:22.960" style="s2">um pete 2013 at the</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:47.280" style="s2">so i qualified in to compete</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">but the only way for me to make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">through the first course would have</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">required me to do a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">16-foot running jump to catch with my</p>

<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">stopped</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">and after after that i basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">um looked in the mirror and said you</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">know like you can keep taping yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:07.920" style="s2">for a couple more years and try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">really push your competitions</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">you probably take injuries that will</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">limit you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">the rest of your life and being able to</p>

<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:23.280" style="s2">can i have a sustainability focus</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">on these practices and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.280" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">i had a few injuries in the last</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">seven years nothing on the severity of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">what i&#39;ve experienced then</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:36.560" style="s2">and i&#39;ve gotten really good at</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">learning to deal with and overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:40.079" style="s2">little aches and pains that you get and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">to build up the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">i mean the basic thing to remember about</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">physical practices is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">same things that injure you are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">things that make you strong</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s all about the dose if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to peak really hard right</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:02.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very possible that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">yourself damage long term</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">however you can do the exact same things</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">and with just a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">mindset you can actually be building a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">buffer that will make you more and more</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">injury proof as you go forward</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">we have a whole aspect of what we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">called body integrity practices which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">about looking at</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">specific demands of whatever we most</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">like to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">and saying how can we build up the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">buffers in our body</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">so that we um we&#39;re not injury also we</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">the lifestyle factors just the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">hour and a half of tricking that you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">that hurts you it&#39;s the 20 hours of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">sitting a day that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">hurt you um</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">and so you can&#39;t necessarily you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">maybe when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">18 and you&#39;re not very and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:50.160" style="s2">have a full-time job</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">you know uh afford to go out to train</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.160" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">just throw out a throw down and not take</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">care of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">bad stuff that&#39;s built up but when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">are stressed out and you&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">60 hours a week sitting on a computer</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">you try to just go through your tricks</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">you&#39;re going to hurt yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:09.280" style="s2">so you need to start to understand not</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">uh the sport can hurt you and how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">buffer yourself from that</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:23.920" style="s2">that question</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">um but that&#39;s actually a huge aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.920" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">what we do we have four pillars</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:29.200" style="s2">in our body aspect of our practice body</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">integrity</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">a lot less of the uh</p>

<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">on the roof right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">which normally would be okay because</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">like i&#39;ve they they&#39;re allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">climbers and to do crazy</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.599" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s part of our lifestyle but</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.599" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s ironic their heroic quests are uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">interrupting our conversations at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">moment my poor wife is going crazy</p>

<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:45.040" style="s2">and their answer to that was to climb on</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">the roof and start jumping</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.040" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">that&#39;s incredible my kids would be very</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">is a property of bodies to know</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">and be known is an attribute of</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">bit of um christian</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.839" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">um you go back for a second cause you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">you you broke</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">uh your your your voice broke for a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">second for me there i didn&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">said um see and be seen and then you</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">stopped</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">okay it is it is one thing to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">and another to know to see and to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:37.119" style="s2">is a property of bodies to know</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">so then he talks about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">between the father and the son</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">and he says whatever therefore is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">property of bodies</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">cannot be predicated either of the</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">but what belongs to the nature of deity</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">is common to the father</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">and the son finally even he himself</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">in the gospel did not say that no one</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">seen the father save the son nor anyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">the son</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">save the father but his words are</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">no one knows the son save the father nor</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">anyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">the father save the son by which it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">clearly shown</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">that whatever among bodily natures is</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">called seeing and be</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">seen being seen is termed</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">between the father and the son and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">knowing and being</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">known by the means of power of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">not by the frailness of the sense of</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">okay so without getting all caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">of christian doctrine my question</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.839" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">whether you&#39;re a christian or a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">transcendence right you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">um something above you and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">connection is made by the mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">what is the purpose of the body</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">in that relationship because it has a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">so what what exactly is the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">in a transcendent relationship</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">um you did break up again for a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">bit uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:32.640" style="s2">so where were we uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">without getting caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">in the weeds yeah without getting caught</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">up in the weeds i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">you broke down there okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">so my my question is</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">can you hear me okay uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">yeah i can now we&#39;ll see how long it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">lasts</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">okay sorry about that um my question is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">if you are pursuing transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">whether you&#39;re a christian or a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">what is the role of the body because i</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">i i gather that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">transcending is is is kind of something</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">exclusive to the intellect to the mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">but i understand that the body plays a</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">role in that so my question is what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">role that the body is playing</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting question and</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">might be answered very differently from</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:33.520" style="s2">detectives the thing that occurs to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">is i always root things in an</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.520" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">um first question to me is not what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">the purpose of the body but what is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.839" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">evolutionary sorry you just you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">broke up there a bit rafe can you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.599" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">repeat that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">um i said what is the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">uh in a kind of spiritual context um is</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">and the first thing that occurs to me is</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:01.119" style="s2">actually to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">reverse the question what is the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.119" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">because i always tend to first root</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:12.319" style="s2">in evolutionary predictive um</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">as uh jordan peterson talks about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">kind of the outermost frame that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">can&#39;t get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">being with and what we know</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">from uh evolutionary perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">the mind evolves</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:33.839" style="s2">to control a body that it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">as the body becomes more complex and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.839" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">need of more control the nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">becomes more complex so</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">when we look at uh there&#39;s an animal</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">called a c</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:47.680" style="s2">squirt for instance and c squirts have</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:49.680" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.680" end="00:47:51.440" style="s2">phases to their life one phase in which</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">they&#39;re mobile and one in which they</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.440" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">plant themselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">and basically sit the barnacle</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about that is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">during the mobile phase of their life</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">a fairly extensive nervous system once</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">they become sedentary once they</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">they they settle into their</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:15.839" style="s2">adult form they actually digest their</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">own brain</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.839" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">nervous system no longer functional from</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">a nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">the the brain first evolves control</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">my argument is always that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.200" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">optimize the function</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">of brain um</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">or the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">mind the heart the emotions the nervous</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">um without putting it in the body and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">this is something that vervekey talks</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:46.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">quite a lot this is foreign cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.839" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">mission is inherently embodied</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:00.720" style="s2">let&#39;s come out of cybernetic theory the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">recognition that if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.720" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">design something that has the capacity</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">it&#39;s actually very hard to get it to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:08.720" style="s2">perceive the way that we perceive unless</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">you give it</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">the capacity for a motor action that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">maps the type of motor actions that we</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">so perception and action are in some</p>

<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">we think about this spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.440" end="00:50:40.480" style="s2">uh we could say that for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:42.880" style="s2">we&#39;re here and we have experiences</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">that the body is inextricable for those</p>

<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">picks up a lot of the same themes that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:12.559" style="s2">verviki talks about which is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">essentially like</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.559" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">when you think you are</p>

<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">right yep see something is to be rooted</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">in the sense of sight</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:40.960" style="s2">some things to be rooted in the sense of</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">to</p>

<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">is there not a reason we are here</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:03.040" style="s2">that we have been given a type of mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">is inextricably linked to a body</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.040" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">that what we are neither</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">is not there is no cogitator you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">have both</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">to be a full being being is embedded in</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually something my friend</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.200" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">andrew talks</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">about who is uh like i said a devout</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">christian</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">but he&#39;s very he he points very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:33.119" style="s2">when christ talks about uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:34.720" style="s2">the you know the saving of everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">the kingdom of heaven</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.720" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">everyone who who died is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.160" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">bodily back into existence that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">of the complete separation of soul</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">body something that he sees is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">non-biblical</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s getting into weeds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">christianity that are way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">pay grade perhaps something</p>

<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">very much enjoyed a similar style of</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">running amok and doing as many twirls</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">and twists and flips as i could at a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.720" end="00:53:27.839" style="s2">younger age but</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily the degradation of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.839" end="00:53:32.559" style="s2">the body from that work but i also have</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">an autoimmune condition that has</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:38.880" style="s2">really limited mobility in many ways um</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">are you aware of any sets of techniques</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.880" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">or practices or do you guys focus on any</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">of that in</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">your work that can uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">provide some support for those who are</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">limited in mobility in that way</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">and also i took just one second</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">cut out at basically you told me that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">you were whether you had an autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">no problem this is uh discord</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">uh we so yeah um with autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">condition are you aware of any</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">sets of techniques or practices that</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">something that you guys focus on</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:19.200" style="s2">perhaps that can support individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">have this limited mobility not just uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:24.640" style="s2">in in relation to age but um</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">like my hands for instance are</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.640" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">particularly weak in grip strength</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">but my legs may be fine for running and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:34.400" style="s2">and jumping</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:35.760" style="s2">um yeah so that and also i looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:37.599" style="s2">video of you running around in the woods</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.760" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">it was fantastic and those trees are</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:40.799" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:42.960" style="s2">perfect do you think that we should</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.799" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">build our world in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:50.640" style="s2">that our ordinary spaces have these</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">perfectly configured mobility areas</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.640" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">or or is it is it more fun to go out</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">into the world and try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">find spots and use them as they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">okay well let&#39;s start with uh the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">uh autoimmune thing and then we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">we should build our world and are the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">the resources</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">talked about this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.839" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">interception the idea that you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">what&#39;s going on inside you</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:42.640" style="s2">in the traditional chinese um island</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">and taoist culture there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.640" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">that you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">learn to essentially auto regulate your</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">organ system you could learn to</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">not auto regulate but to consciously</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">regulate your immune</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">your organ systems you strong enough</p>

<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">i decided one day to sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">meditate and i did</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">a concentration meditation for probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">10 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">i did a body and i used that body scan</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">meditation to go into</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">and so basically i felt my breath and my</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">lungs</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">repeatedly then i tried to take that</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">into feeling my heart</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:26.319" style="s2">and trying to feel different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">the heartbeat</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">and even trying to slow the heartbeat</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">down by holding the pause longer</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">i have achieved that sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">pretty weird um</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">and then i went from the heartbeat down</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:40.559" style="s2">the stomach right and try to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">blood around the stomach then down into</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">the small intestine</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">large intestine in the colon i meditated</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">on essentially giving</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">the peristalsis of my gut to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.400" end="00:57:54.480" style="s2">i meditated on this kind of cooling yin</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.480" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">and uh this is a little bit personal but</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:58:00.240" style="s2">i was having between 12 to 16 bowel</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:02.960" style="s2">minutes a day</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.240" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">um the time leading up to that and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.960" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">day it was down to six and after that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:09.359" style="s2">was down to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">pretty much went forward um that was</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">powerful for me um also found the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:19.839" style="s2">carnivore diet is very powerful for</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">uh for autoimmunes um</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.839" end="00:58:25.599" style="s2">i i was quite skeptical when peterson</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:29.119" style="s2">peterson saying it i had friends who did</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.599" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">it give it a try</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.119" end="00:58:34.079" style="s2">i found the results really profound i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:36.160" style="s2">not carnivore now</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.079" end="00:58:37.680" style="s2">been trying to reintroduce things and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.160" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">see if they work for me and i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.680" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">kind of enough in the phase of trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">what really works um but i have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">greatly increased function</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:54.799" style="s2">so that was question one question two uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">the trees</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.799" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">and uh what do we do and how should we</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:04.160" style="s2">design our so those trees are</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:05.280" style="s2">really beautiful but i have found</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.160" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">beautiful trees</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.280" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">all over the world and so i think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">of times people</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">don&#39;t see what&#39;s around them because</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not sailing in their landscape</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have the physical</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.440" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:22.559" style="s2">or awarenesses that would make them</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">you know very often on my videos oh if i</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.559" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">had trees like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">i would i would do that too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">actually more the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">if they did what i did then they would</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">find the trees like that in there</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:35.359" style="s2">obviously if you live in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">the sahara desert or the arctic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.359" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:39.440" style="s2">um but in most major cities there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.079" end="00:59:41.520" style="s2">some beautiful trees in</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.440" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">the area that has lots of trees you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.520" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">um there there is stuff out there um</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">our environments have been designed to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">make it easy for us to move around</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">um and that&#39;s uh that&#39;s okay for certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:59.680" style="s2">purposes</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">it&#39;s also taken us taken us away from</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.680" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">exposure to things</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:03.760" style="s2">the bodies need development is big</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:06.880" style="s2">influence on me</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.760" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">talks about flat ground as a cage you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.880" end="01:00:14.319" style="s2">constantly missing these nourishments</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:16.640" style="s2">of uneven textures under our feet</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.319" end="01:00:17.520" style="s2">the nourishment of hanging from things</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.640" end="01:00:21.359" style="s2">and to climb</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.520" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">things so uh i</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.359" end="01:00:25.440" style="s2">i like to go to the zoo and look at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">gibbon habitats and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:30.960" style="s2">uh the primate habitats and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">like everyone should have a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.960" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">of primate habitat</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">in their house well maybe every office</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">should have a primate habitat</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">so human beings can go be primate we</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">forget</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">that we are but are and it actually is</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">uh i think it&#39;s i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">quite surprising how much becoming a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.480" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">better monkey can contribute to becoming</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">a better human being</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">or eight for that matter</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:04.720" style="s2">awesome thank you and i appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:05.920" style="s2">solidarity with the autoimmune condition</p>

<p begin="01:01:05.920" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important um there there</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.319" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">seem to be so many people with</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">autoimmune conditions</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">uh toiling away working in the world and</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.240" end="01:02:01.119" style="s2">children and</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">you talk a lot about uh being</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.119" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">a proponent of roughhousing and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">you know but i i i try to let my kids</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:11.119" style="s2">roughhouse but i usually draw the line</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">at tears</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.119" end="01:02:18.400" style="s2">uh you know what do you draw a line</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">between uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.400" end="01:02:23.440" style="s2">the playing around rough and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:23.440" style="s2">beating each other up</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">yeah so i mean our rule is that it has</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.240" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">to be consensual</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.000" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">i can i mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">sometimes my son will cry and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">want to give up the game</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">back in him</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">something that has been highlighted</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">particularly in my son recently</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">but something that reminds me of what</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">reiki played</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:50.720" style="s2">so in our culture we have this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">play is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.720" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">um whimsical and frivolous and we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">play we imagine laughing and skipping</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">through the fields</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:01.200" style="s2">children play is is actually much more</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">sometimes that that pushing their edge</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.839" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">and appreciation and dealing with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">other kids</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">emotions have to delegate those and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:20.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge aspect of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.799" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">learning so</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.480" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">just the other day um my son&#39;s five</p>

<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:28.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s a boy next door who&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.160" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">main playmate who&#39;s seven years old</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.240" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">uh the boy next door has been bodies</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">um i haven&#39;t pushed here to</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">to kind of get as formal with his</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">training in these things yet</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">um there&#39;s some couple out of background</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">and he&#39;s done some too</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">but he hasn&#39;t done as much</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.280" end="01:03:57.280" style="s2">formal striking a round kick in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:04:00.480" style="s2">solar plexus</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.280" end="01:04:01.839" style="s2">and he walked away and he he was a</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.480" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.839" end="01:04:06.559" style="s2">knocked out of him and tears in his eyes</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:07.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.559" end="01:04:09.920" style="s2">i helped him regulate because i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:12.720" style="s2">want them to go to control but if he</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.920" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">chooses to go back into the game because</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.720" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">he feels like he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">stop him</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">the big thing is that we have the role</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:24.720" style="s2">that you can&#39;t punch anybody unless you</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">ask</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.720" end="01:04:28.480" style="s2">you know you have to not be punching</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.480" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">if it&#39;s in play when it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:35.039" style="s2">a mutual kind of growing experience then</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s welcome</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.039" end="01:04:39.119" style="s2">you can push each other as hard as you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">want but as soon as it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.119" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">punishing the other person</p>
