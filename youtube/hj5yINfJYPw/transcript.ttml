<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:39.270" style="s2">in the evening sorry it&#39;s a bit windy</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:40.700" style="s2">let&#39;s see if I can cover my head&#39;s a bit</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.320" end="00:08:53.850" style="s2">both working part time but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">take care of my son and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.850" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">the day is pretty much filled</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:03.180" style="s2">except maybe right now given that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">just strolling but then I have time to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.180" end="00:09:08.270" style="s2">do some game B activity in the evenings</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">for me all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.270" end="00:09:17.430" style="s2">9 10 11 p.m. that&#39;s more or less the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:22.710" style="s2">time where I appear and livestream a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.430" end="00:09:24.150" style="s2">but you know like I would rather he</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.710" end="00:09:26.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be on my channel right</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.150" end="00:09:29.910" style="s2">like or your channel I would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.400" end="00:09:32.460" style="s2">there to be kind of like a space where</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.910" end="00:09:34.230" style="s2">you see that there are conversations</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.460" end="00:09:38.370" style="s2">that are going on and you just join them</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.230" end="00:09:41.460" style="s2">and they stop some may be scheduled some</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.370" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">not but you know like I called it the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.460" end="00:09:48.120" style="s2">digital patio you know or a digital</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:50.250" style="s2">courtyard courtyard Oh patio yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.120" end="00:09:53.160" style="s2">saw your your posted in game be a game</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.250" end="00:09:56.280" style="s2">be whose furnace wkb things right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.160" end="00:09:59.490" style="s2">like all the sub sub parts - I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.280" end="00:10:03.270" style="s2">they the game be cafe was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.490" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">that but it didn&#39;t quite work out as far</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.270" end="00:10:06.900" style="s2">as popping in and having people in there</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:09.180" style="s2">but we haven&#39;t tried it during the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.900" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">pandemic or so many people are home and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.180" end="00:10:15.750" style="s2">looking for a connection I think it</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:17.250" style="s2">might be more possible right now I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.750" end="00:10:20.360" style="s2">I have an opinion about the digital</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.250" end="00:10:23.780" style="s2">about the game be cut off your house</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.360" end="00:10:26.700" style="s2">because you know it was my friends who</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.780" end="00:10:29.130" style="s2">built that you know Wendy and Christian</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.700" end="00:10:30.870" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been using it with them since</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.130" end="00:10:32.460" style="s2">then you know whenever we have a call we</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.870" end="00:10:35.190" style="s2">use it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.460" end="00:10:38.580" style="s2">so in principle someone could still hop</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.190" end="00:10:41.670" style="s2">in but it never happens anymore but so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.580" end="00:10:44.190" style="s2">my sense about that is that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.670" end="00:10:46.830" style="s2">one conversation right so and I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.190" end="00:10:48.600" style="s2">rather have a place where there might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.830" end="00:10:52.680" style="s2">a number of conversations going on at</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.600" end="00:10:56.450" style="s2">the same time so it&#39;s like at maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.680" end="00:10:59.700" style="s2">higher level than the individual zoom or</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.450" end="00:11:01.260" style="s2">you know video chat more like a place</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.700" end="00:11:02.910" style="s2">where you can see what what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.260" end="00:11:05.070" style="s2">conversations are going on and if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.910" end="00:11:07.750" style="s2">want you start one and then people can</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.070" end="00:11:11.290" style="s2">get notified right so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.750" end="00:11:13.000" style="s2">see Nick entered the patio right or Nick</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.290" end="00:11:16.300" style="s2">started a conversation you want to join</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:17.439" style="s2">like and then so it would be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.300" end="00:11:19.569" style="s2">more like a list of ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.439" end="00:11:23.550" style="s2">conversations and maybe you would even</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.569" end="00:11:28.420" style="s2">see like a snapshot of who&#39;s inside and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.550" end="00:11:29.769" style="s2">this is my kind of my vision problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.420" end="00:11:31.509" style="s2">with the game people coffee house was</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.769" end="00:11:36.120" style="s2">basically notifications right people</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.509" end="00:11:38.319" style="s2">don&#39;t know when someone is online yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.120" end="00:11:40.300" style="s2">absolutely and that&#39;s a big like if</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.319" end="00:11:41.620" style="s2">there&#39;s enough pop you know if there</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.300" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">were a million people using that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.620" end="00:11:44.829" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be a problem because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:45.819" style="s2">always being there&#39;d be too many people</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.829" end="00:11:49.180" style="s2">there and that would be unusable on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.819" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">other side but yes having a digital like</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.180" end="00:11:53.620" style="s2">like what you said a digital patio that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:55.269" style="s2">helps you form those conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.620" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">you can pop on when you&#39;re free and see</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.269" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">who else is available and what you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">join and what you can can leave um I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:03.509" style="s2">think was Jordan Hall who told me about</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">a specific kind of calm conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.509" end="00:12:08.709" style="s2">because I&#39;m of course the idea cafes</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:10.149" style="s2">after the World Cafe and we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.709" end="00:12:12.370" style="s2">about those type of conversations of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.149" end="00:12:14.259" style="s2">having a large group of people rotate</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.370" end="00:12:16.180" style="s2">between tables and there&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.259" end="00:12:19.149" style="s2">it&#39;s called circle or something it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.180" end="00:12:23.170" style="s2">circling which of courses like I sensed</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.149" end="00:12:24.759" style="s2">on that something and Jordan I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.170" end="00:12:26.259" style="s2">think all it sort of circling my friends</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.759" end="00:12:29.019" style="s2">by the friend called circling but like</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.259" end="00:12:33.430" style="s2">you go in and leave conversations as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.019" end="00:12:35.110" style="s2">want so there&#39;s a main room and never</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.430" end="00:12:36.790" style="s2">got in a conversation you go back there</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.110" end="00:12:39.189" style="s2">and whenever anyone else joins you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.790" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">decide on a topic and then go and be</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.189" end="00:12:44.620" style="s2">part of a table and anyone can join that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:46.389" style="s2">generally those don&#39;t join it you you go</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.620" end="00:12:48.250" style="s2">to the main meeting room and you you</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.389" end="00:12:51.160" style="s2">wait until there&#39;s other people to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.250" end="00:12:54.279" style="s2">a conversation but with your feet so if</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.160" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">the conversation isn&#39;t if people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.279" end="00:12:56.920" style="s2">showing up in a way you don&#39;t like or</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:12:58.389" style="s2">the conversations going way you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.920" end="00:13:00.100" style="s2">like you&#39;re totally allowed you of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.389" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">course you&#39;re allowed to leave like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.100" end="00:13:03.189" style="s2">part of the culture that you just cuz</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:04.509" style="s2">you don&#39;t know why someone left they</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.189" end="00:13:06.220" style="s2">might have just been there for enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.509" end="00:13:08.170" style="s2">time and other people want to be you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.220" end="00:13:11.800" style="s2">know and having something cooler to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.170" end="00:13:12.819" style="s2">with it&#39;s digital yeah I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.800" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">whether you are talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.819" end="00:13:17.949" style="s2">physical yeah there&#39;s a few ways in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">physical place usually there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.949" end="00:13:21.190" style="s2">of sirens and then one common meeting</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">place when you&#39;re done with yours</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.190" end="00:13:24.790" style="s2">back and when there&#39;s three or four</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:26.470" style="s2">people you then decide on a topic you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.790" end="00:13:30.070" style="s2">want to discuss and then you go and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.470" end="00:13:31.900" style="s2">discuss it and people can digital</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.070" end="00:13:34.500" style="s2">version of that is more or less yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.900" end="00:13:37.540" style="s2">I would like to see actually yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.500" end="00:13:39.460" style="s2">maybe an additional layer would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.540" end="00:13:41.430" style="s2">really that even if you&#39;re offline that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.460" end="00:13:45.640" style="s2">you might say okay where if Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.430" end="00:13:48.970" style="s2">Jordan Hall appears in the party that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.640" end="00:13:50.710" style="s2">want to be notified right like I&#39;m fine</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.970" end="00:13:52.330" style="s2">being disrupted in whatever I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.710" end="00:13:54.580" style="s2">you know that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.330" end="00:13:56.170" style="s2">it&#39;d be good to have your notifications</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.580" end="00:13:58.780" style="s2">more hierarchical where you&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.170" end="00:14:01.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t want everything in facebook but</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.780" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2">when this person posts this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.180" end="00:14:06.910" style="s2">want they all have one option like</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.100" end="00:14:09.400" style="s2">YouTube this is the little bell it&#39;s yep</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.910" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">too much of like if you put it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.400" end="00:14:12.370" style="s2">everything you get too many</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.690" end="00:14:13.750" style="s2">notifications so it&#39;s like I just really</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.370" end="00:14:16.450" style="s2">actually just want to know when the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.750" end="00:14:19.540" style="s2">people I follow go live that&#39;s all yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.450" end="00:14:21.010" style="s2">yeah otherwise I don&#39;t I can watch it</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.540" end="00:14:22.540" style="s2">whenever but live is a different a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.010" end="00:14:24.700" style="s2">different context I had an idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.540" end="00:14:26.230" style="s2">yesterday which I have run by nobody and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.700" end="00:14:27.670" style="s2">I posted up and game B it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.230" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">things where I don&#39;t really want to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.670" end="00:14:34.630" style="s2">it on but I would like participate in it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:35.830" style="s2">which is there&#39;s so many people like I</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.630" end="00:14:39.430" style="s2">think a lot of us have found that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.830" end="00:14:41.710" style="s2">conversations are the thing they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.430" end="00:14:42.640" style="s2">best part I mean especially with who</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.710" end="00:14:44.950" style="s2">you&#39;re having conversation with and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.640" end="00:14:47.110" style="s2">think there&#39;s those of us who are okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.950" end="00:14:49.410" style="s2">finding people to have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.110" end="00:14:52.660" style="s2">with and people who that&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.410" end="00:14:54.280" style="s2">difficult task and even for us that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.660" end="00:14:55.690" style="s2">not a difficult task like I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.280" end="00:14:57.160" style="s2">reach out to people like I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.690" end="00:15:00.190" style="s2">couple of conversations in Jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.160" end="00:15:01.570" style="s2">and anyone who has a project and like</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.190" end="00:15:02.650" style="s2">ooh I want to find out more about that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.570" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">reach out and try to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.650" end="00:15:08.380" style="s2">conversation with them but what I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">like anyway so my idea was to do almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.380" end="00:15:12.150" style="s2">like a I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever done</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:16.300" style="s2">like chain letters when you were a kid</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.150" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">where you like you will get stickers in</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.300" end="00:15:18.580" style="s2">the mail or something you&#39;ll send it to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:19.960" style="s2">for people who will send it to for</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.580" end="00:15:21.940" style="s2">people to send to for people and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.960" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">math never went you know you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.940" end="00:15:28.120" style="s2">like a million stories right forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:30.190" style="s2">out five or whatever um doing so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.120" end="00:15:32.470" style="s2">idea this is a lot of run in versus</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.190" end="00:15:33.900" style="s2">somewhat simple idea is so like you and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.470" end="00:15:36.870" style="s2">I started let&#39;s say right and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.900" end="00:15:40.140" style="s2">a conversation and then our job is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.870" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">match each other with somebody else that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.140" end="00:15:44.190" style="s2">we think they would enjoy a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.790" end="00:15:46.080" style="s2">with and we give them the topic or they</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.190" end="00:15:48.030" style="s2">can decide on a topic together whichever</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.080" end="00:15:52.290" style="s2">one works for them so if they have it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.030" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">you know rule Omega or Cove in 1900 I</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.290" end="00:15:54.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the topics would be we</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.490" end="00:15:56.580" style="s2">can generate a bunch of like twelve</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.990" end="00:15:58.380" style="s2">different topics so the people who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.580" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2">generate them could just take one right</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.380" end="00:16:04.430" style="s2">roll the wheel you&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.300" end="00:16:06.930" style="s2">today parenting are you parents um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.430" end="00:16:09.570" style="s2">after you&#39;ve had the conversation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.930" end="00:16:13.170" style="s2">each so if it&#39;s weekly saying I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.570" end="00:16:16.080" style="s2">have a comment always set up with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.170" end="00:16:17.790" style="s2">person before noon right so whoever you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.080" end="00:16:19.410" style="s2">set me up it&#39;s got the call I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.790" end="00:16:21.840" style="s2">hear the last ten seconds I&#39;m sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.410" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">was like Abby was trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.840" end="00:16:29.640" style="s2">conversation just so we ever two people</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:32.100" style="s2">started to be you and I could be me and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.640" end="00:16:34.080" style="s2">Eric whoever starts it we then I then</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.100" end="00:16:35.370" style="s2">match Eric up with somebody whether he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.080" end="00:16:37.140" style="s2">had a conversation with them or not</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.370" end="00:16:39.270" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter it&#39;s just that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.140" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">each set each other up with a comment</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.270" end="00:16:42.690" style="s2">with a partner a person if two people</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:44.550" style="s2">have to figure out what time works for</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.690" end="00:16:45.540" style="s2">them in the next week or so you can you</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.550" end="00:16:47.430" style="s2">have people in different times know</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.540" end="00:16:49.110" style="s2">people who liked wanting to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.430" end="00:16:50.640" style="s2">conversation every month could have</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.110" end="00:16:52.080" style="s2">conversation a free month was the one in</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.640" end="00:16:54.300" style="s2">every week could have it every week for</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.080" end="00:16:56.100" style="s2">the point is suggest that like a one</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.300" end="00:16:58.440" style="s2">person needs to start two people sorry</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.100" end="00:17:00.390" style="s2">needs to start it and then you&#39;ll each</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.440" end="00:17:01.710" style="s2">go off like every week I would have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.390" end="00:17:02.910" style="s2">different conversation with somebody new</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.710" end="00:17:04.140" style="s2">the first time would be with you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.910" end="00:17:05.640" style="s2">then you set me up with Eric and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:08.070" style="s2">Eric would set me up with Wendy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.640" end="00:17:11.190" style="s2">Wendy would say you don&#39;t like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.070" end="00:17:18.770" style="s2">in those generates not because we could</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.190" end="00:17:26.610" style="s2">have people in a moment because</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.770" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">absolutely this is a game among many</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.610" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">that could be done right in that sense I</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:35.790" style="s2">like how Peter Limburg is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">providing this general space for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.790" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">number of different experiments but</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:49.100" style="s2">I wonder whether such a formal structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:51.529" style="s2">would go far right because people have</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.100" end="00:17:53.240" style="s2">yeah busy lives and each person has</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.529" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">their own favorite way of going about</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.240" end="00:17:59.330" style="s2">these things about like a dance card</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">right or like you&#39;d be like yes you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.330" end="00:18:03.710" style="s2">met like again those of us who are more</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:05.419" style="s2">well-known in the gaming be space</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.710" end="00:18:07.330" style="s2">because we&#39;re so I&#39;m part of so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.419" end="00:18:10.549" style="s2">videos and part of so many conversations</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.330" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">most of the people&#39;s first idea right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.549" end="00:18:14.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna have more than one idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:17.000" style="s2">one conversation a week so if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.690" end="00:18:18.710" style="s2">already matched up I&#39;m not gonna you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.000" end="00:18:20.269" style="s2">don&#39;t even accept a second one so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.710" end="00:18:22.250" style="s2">have to find somebody else and in so</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.269" end="00:18:24.649" style="s2">doing we&#39;re gonna we want to generate</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.250" end="00:18:26.929" style="s2">within the game beats face people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.649" end="00:18:28.130" style="s2">wanted this alright it go if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.929" end="00:18:29.690" style="s2">brand new and you don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.130" end="00:18:31.460" style="s2">start a conversation you just put your</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.530" end="00:24:20.110" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:24.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not feedback yes just an echo okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.110" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2">truth is that it&#39;s all working out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.290" end="00:24:29.660" style="s2">technology because it&#39;s also like so</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.980" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">many people when you can zoom already in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.660" end="00:24:33.830" style="s2">them in this pandemic hit zoom went sky</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:36.050" style="s2">rocketed</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.830" end="00:24:38.270" style="s2">everyone&#39;s on soon people hadn&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.050" end="00:24:39.470" style="s2">of the zoom or using zoom and so they</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.270" end="00:24:41.510" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough bandwidth like they</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.470" end="00:24:43.940" style="s2">don&#39;t they to haven&#39;t figured out their</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.510" end="00:24:46.340" style="s2">service for that many people and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.940" end="00:24:49.610" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the disservice of game a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.340" end="00:24:51.680" style="s2">is that to some degree you can&#39;t own</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.610" end="00:24:53.480" style="s2">that right you can&#39;t be like listen you</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.680" end="00:24:54.920" style="s2">know like we were working it was we were</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.480" end="00:24:56.810" style="s2">working out our kinks but now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.920" end="00:24:58.940" style="s2">like millions of people where they used</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.810" end="00:25:00.980" style="s2">to be tens of thousands on we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.940" end="00:25:02.900" style="s2">have some growing pains during this time</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.980" end="00:25:04.580" style="s2">period but in order for them to say that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.900" end="00:25:06.410" style="s2">then you lose trust in them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.580" end="00:25:08.360" style="s2">know like instead of them I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.410" end="00:25:10.670" style="s2">like bringing you into the process like</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.360" end="00:25:12.500" style="s2">here&#39;s where we are return to fix it but</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.670" end="00:25:15.380" style="s2">we can only do it so fast it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.500" end="00:25:17.560" style="s2">well just let everyone&#39;s calls kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.380" end="00:25:21.950" style="s2">be a little bit shitty I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.560" end="00:25:25.580" style="s2">currency is not incentivized in many</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.950" end="00:25:29.090" style="s2">cases no its disincentivizes but I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.580" end="00:25:32.600" style="s2">think that when you&#39;re a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.090" end="00:25:34.190" style="s2">business that operates for-profit then</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.600" end="00:25:36.890" style="s2">you need that secrecy where is when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.190" end="00:25:38.420" style="s2">something we own together and we want it</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.890" end="00:25:39.920" style="s2">to succeed therefore we want to know</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.420" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not working we</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.920" end="00:25:44.800" style="s2">want more transparency so that we could</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:50.260" style="s2">offer solutions right I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.800" end="00:25:50.260" style="s2">certain sense of what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:58.790" style="s2">ownership that&#39;s not the right word but</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.490" end="00:26:01.100" style="s2">like if I&#39;m if I&#39;m an employee a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.790" end="00:26:02.540" style="s2">customer to a business I want good</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.100" end="00:26:04.130" style="s2">customer service and I want them to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.540" end="00:26:05.330" style="s2">above and beyond I want make no mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.130" end="00:26:08.930" style="s2">if they make mistakes I&#39;m gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.330" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">right plus some whereas like if I go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.930" end="00:26:14.090" style="s2">a restaurant and they make my boil you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:18.560" style="s2">would expect with an individual what are</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.090" end="00:26:19.910" style="s2">you an individual to display sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.560" end="00:26:24.170" style="s2">you&#39;re breaking up okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.910" end="00:26:27.350" style="s2">I can&#39;t hear you I can try speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.170" end="00:26:29.160" style="s2">closer to my mic ethanol&#39;s is just laggy</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.350" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s good yep</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.160" end="00:26:36.390" style="s2">okay so yeah I was just making the brief</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:39.930" style="s2">comment that you ideally would expect a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.390" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">corporation to behave like an indoor you</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.930" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">would have the same expectations of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.920" style="s2">corporation I believe you would have an</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:48.660" style="s2">image of a friend you want them to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.920" end="00:26:52.650" style="s2">what they say they&#39;re gonna do be on it</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.660" end="00:26:54.420" style="s2">and be and I guess that&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.650" end="00:26:55.770" style="s2">this is like what a corporate like if I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.420" end="00:26:58.770" style="s2">go to a restaurant and I get food</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.770" end="00:27:01.590" style="s2">poisoning I do because it&#39;s too much of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.770" end="00:27:03.480" style="s2">a process but but I might feel entitled</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.590" end="00:27:04.680" style="s2">to sue right I might leave I could</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.480" end="00:27:06.210" style="s2">easily sue</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.680" end="00:27:09.240" style="s2">whereas I went to a friend&#39;s house and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.210" end="00:27:10.650" style="s2">they gave me food poisoning I might not</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.240" end="00:27:12.510" style="s2">eat there again but I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.650" end="00:27:15.050" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t sue them right like I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.510" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">sure there&#39;s a different level of both</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.050" end="00:27:19.530" style="s2">that like we&#39;ve required to not know how</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:21.990" style="s2">the sausage is met and we put on them</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.530" end="00:27:23.790" style="s2">that they are supposed to fix it like we</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.990" end="00:27:25.830" style="s2">want we don&#39;t take ownership of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.790" end="00:27:27.660" style="s2">problem right I can&#39;t offer Amazon a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.830" end="00:27:29.400" style="s2">solution I can just say you didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.660" end="00:27:31.500" style="s2">me my shipment in two days like you were</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.400" end="00:27:34.140" style="s2">supposed to I can&#39;t actually help</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.500" end="00:27:36.330" style="s2">improve that system whereas when we own</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.140" end="00:27:38.430" style="s2">something together it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.330" end="00:27:39.540" style="s2">dynamic because it&#39;s like okay people</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.430" end="00:27:41.190" style="s2">aren&#39;t getting there like right now</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.540" end="00:27:42.450" style="s2">during the pandemic two days shipping is</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.190" end="00:27:44.520" style="s2">out the window people that like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.450" end="00:27:47.970" style="s2">supply chains disrupted there&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.520" end="00:27:49.800" style="s2">way more people Amazon guarantee you is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.970" end="00:27:51.750" style="s2">gonna break their employees over this</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.800" end="00:27:55.350" style="s2">whereas if we own Amazon we could be</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.750" end="00:27:57.060" style="s2">like yes we want employees to be well</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.350" end="00:27:59.250" style="s2">treated and we understand that during</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.060" end="00:28:00.900" style="s2">this time period it&#39;s anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.250" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">working is under more stress because you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.900" end="00:28:04.920" style="s2">have to go to a physical place where</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:05.850" style="s2">there&#39;s people and hopefully or to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.920" end="00:28:09.420" style="s2">someone who&#39;s not more highly</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.850" end="00:28:11.010" style="s2">susceptible to cope at 19 but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.420" end="00:28:12.300" style="s2">know like if there was transparency we</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.010" end="00:28:13.650" style="s2">could figure it out together we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.300" end="00:28:15.540" style="s2">work through it but right now it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.650" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">like division of like customer and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.540" end="00:28:20.610" style="s2">corporation where we expect them to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:23.160" style="s2">almost be perfect and because of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.610" end="00:28:24.930" style="s2">they have to keep secrets and then we</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.160" end="00:28:26.490" style="s2">get mad about the secrets when like if</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.930" end="00:28:28.560" style="s2">it was transparent than we could have we</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.490" end="00:28:30.330" style="s2">could see why right like oh just like we</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.560" end="00:28:32.460" style="s2">can see with all of our unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.330" end="00:28:36.690" style="s2">benefits that&#39;s on the news constantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.460" end="00:28:39.630" style="s2">the huge spike in traffic basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.690" end="00:28:41.890" style="s2">people applying for unemployment we</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.630" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">could see right Amazon&#39;s were</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.890" end="00:28:45.730" style="s2">people were 100 million and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:49.420" style="s2">five billion like it&#39;s like oh okay I</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.730" end="00:28:51.400" style="s2">see we see why so and we could create a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.420" end="00:28:53.020" style="s2">system that helped instead of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.400" end="00:28:54.730" style="s2">having to hierarchy down I&#39;m like okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.020" end="00:28:57.330" style="s2">medical supplies clearly have to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.730" end="00:28:59.950" style="s2">shipped once but the thing is if</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.330" end="00:29:03.490" style="s2">everyone&#39;s never in supplies Aaron right</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.950" end="00:29:05.980" style="s2">then in any one if we all are seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.490" end="00:29:07.390" style="s2">same picture the same net a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.980" end="00:29:08.920" style="s2">the whole company and everyone in it</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.390" end="00:29:11.050" style="s2">and we all know that we&#39;re all seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.920" end="00:29:12.570" style="s2">then we can trust each other and anyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.050" end="00:29:14.350" style="s2">who does have the solution can step up</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.570" end="00:29:16.390" style="s2">broadcast it to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.350" end="00:29:18.660" style="s2">mm-hmm rather than having to go through</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.390" end="00:29:20.920" style="s2">all these channels where they could get</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.660" end="00:29:24.250" style="s2">the signal could get missed but all</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.920" end="00:29:26.440" style="s2">sorts of reasons yeah exactly and there</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.250" end="00:29:28.060" style="s2">could be ways to prioritize shipping it</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.440" end="00:29:29.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how long of a prime</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.060" end="00:29:31.000" style="s2">membership you you know how long you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.560" end="00:29:33.790" style="s2">been a prime member or whatever our</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.000" end="00:29:37.210" style="s2">version is if that is a burden something</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.790" end="00:29:39.880" style="s2">we do at all but what matters is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.210" end="00:29:41.290" style="s2">what is your need for this thing right</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.880" end="00:29:42.760" style="s2">now right and that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.290" end="00:29:44.530" style="s2">Amazon should have been still a long</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.760" end="00:29:46.810" style="s2">time ago for the good of their employees</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.530" end="00:29:50.140" style="s2">I don&#39;t always need two days shipping on</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.810" end="00:29:52.270" style="s2">something sometimes it could take three</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.140" end="00:29:54.070" style="s2">weeks and I&#39;m fine with it other things</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.270" end="00:29:56.380" style="s2">I have a higher priority so if we could</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.070" end="00:29:57.880" style="s2">input that into the system and it could</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.380" end="00:30:00.580" style="s2">figure it out and you could also like</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.880" end="00:30:02.830" style="s2">right now during the pandemic they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.580" end="00:30:06.700" style="s2">made like I ordered hand sanitizer and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.830" end="00:30:08.170" style="s2">face masks six weeks ago and they were</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.700" end="00:30:09.670" style="s2">ordered and they were like and then a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.170" end="00:30:11.020" style="s2">week later they were like actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.670" end="00:30:12.370" style="s2">because of the pandemic we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.020" end="00:30:13.780" style="s2">enough we&#39;re gonna say they sent me the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.370" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">wrong road I thought it wasn&#39;t Amazon it</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.780" end="00:30:19.900" style="s2">was one of their suppliers but similar</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:21.370" style="s2">experience with pantry foods and and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.900" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.370" end="00:30:24.370" style="s2">getting when I order which is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:25.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.370" end="00:30:27.490" style="s2">but transparency could help with that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.690" end="00:30:29.680" style="s2">then I have someone like my dad who is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.490" end="00:30:31.720" style="s2">on Amazon Prime and although he was</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.680" end="00:30:33.670" style="s2">ordering quite regularly before now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.720" end="00:30:35.320" style="s2">kind of life or death that he can get it</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.670" end="00:30:37.510" style="s2">because if he has to go out to pick</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.320" end="00:30:40.150" style="s2">something up he&#39;s much more susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.510" end="00:30:42.010" style="s2">so those people should be at a higher</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.150" end="00:30:43.390" style="s2">level and they should be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.010" end="00:30:46.090" style="s2">when they can get their thing later</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.390" end="00:30:48.250" style="s2">right like yeah I don&#39;t need this for</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.090" end="00:30:49.300" style="s2">two weeks it&#39;s headphones or no I need</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.250" end="00:30:50.800" style="s2">this right now because it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.300" end="00:30:52.300" style="s2">profession right and if I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.800" end="00:30:53.350" style="s2">headphones tomorrow I&#39;m gonna get fired</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.300" end="00:30:55.090" style="s2">or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.350" end="00:30:57.040" style="s2">you can put and you can see whether</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.090" end="00:30:58.180" style="s2">someone&#39;s always a last-minute person</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.040" end="00:30:59.800" style="s2">who always needs it shipped overnight</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.180" end="00:31:02.050" style="s2">and those people should have more of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.800" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">pause to their crime and other any way</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.050" end="00:31:05.980" style="s2">that we can figure out the math and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:07.690" style="s2">what&#39;s working better together when it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.980" end="00:31:09.280" style="s2">started wouldn&#39;t work transparent and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.690" end="00:31:11.560" style="s2">have ownership in it so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.280" end="00:31:13.180" style="s2">leaving you know like I should be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.560" end="00:31:14.800" style="s2">to fix that same as you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.180" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t leave it to Jeff Bezos right</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.800" end="00:31:20.350" style="s2">because then he breaks his employees to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:21.640" style="s2">make his customers happy or some places</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.350" end="00:31:23.350" style="s2">break their customers to make their</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.640" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">employees happy which is clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.350" end="00:31:27.130" style="s2">going to keep you in business very long</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:30.310" style="s2">I was actually just watching a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.130" end="00:31:32.380" style="s2">documentary on Jeff Bezos it wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.310" end="00:31:35.260" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that great somebody posted it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.380" end="00:31:37.420" style="s2">thinking be don&#39;t even remember it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.260" end="00:31:39.910" style="s2">like the rise of the rise and reign of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.420" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">Jeff Bezos it just wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.910" end="00:31:43.900" style="s2">either it just wasn&#39;t it&#39;s the same old</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:45.070" style="s2">same old about Amazon it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.900" end="00:31:47.410" style="s2">there&#39;s anything in there that&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.070" end="00:31:49.810" style="s2">that&#39;s oh that&#39;s how they operate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.410" end="00:31:51.790" style="s2">like a highly efficient but everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.810" end="00:31:54.730" style="s2">looks at him like a visionary and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.790" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">although yeah I guess so he was also</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.730" end="00:31:58.180" style="s2">just in the right place at the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:01.090" style="s2">time like he&#39;s not the only one to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.180" end="00:32:02.260" style="s2">an e-commerce on online yet his is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.090" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">one that took off during that time</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.260" end="00:32:06.280" style="s2">period and then once you get that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:08.440" style="s2">success then you start building the ego</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.280" end="00:32:10.360" style="s2">of like yes I&#39;m the one guy and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.440" end="00:32:13.810" style="s2">like no actually you were just lucky</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.360" end="00:32:15.880" style="s2">enough yeah I heard something once about</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.810" end="00:32:20.830" style="s2">how you know when it when they&#39;re ruined</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.880" end="00:32:22.330" style="s2">initially all of these you know maybe 20</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.830" end="00:32:24.610" style="s2">years ago I don&#39;t know all these startup</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.330" end="00:32:26.110" style="s2">companies in Silicon Valley and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.610" end="00:32:28.690" style="s2">were looking at all the successful ones</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.110" end="00:32:29.740" style="s2">that&#39;s why they were successful and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.690" end="00:32:31.390" style="s2">know figure out okay well these are the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.740" end="00:32:33.550" style="s2">things we do need to do but then it</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.390" end="00:32:35.260" style="s2">turned out that like you know the nine</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.550" end="00:32:37.180" style="s2">out of ten companies didn&#39;t make it they</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.260" end="00:32:38.950" style="s2">were also doing all the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.180" end="00:32:40.030" style="s2">just luck that that taint one made it</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.950" end="00:32:43.390" style="s2">not because of the things they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.030" end="00:32:45.130" style="s2">doing necessarily yeah there&#39;s a I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.390" end="00:32:47.650" style="s2">know the fallacy very well but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.130" end="00:32:49.390" style="s2">like survivor fallacy I know they show</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.650" end="00:32:51.010" style="s2">the picture for world war two planes for</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.390" end="00:32:52.390" style="s2">they were likes when planes would come</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.010" end="00:32:53.560" style="s2">back and have bullet holes in them they</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.390" end="00:32:55.900" style="s2">could see where the bullet holes were</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.560" end="00:32:57.460" style="s2">and they reinforced those parts but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.900" end="00:32:59.980" style="s2">problem was it was only the planes that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.460" end="00:33:02.500" style="s2">made it back so when you run shot in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.980" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">very critical part like the fuel right</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.500" end="00:33:06.179" style="s2">then you explode and you die and so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:08.669" style="s2">don&#39;t make it back to normal it</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.179" end="00:33:10.980" style="s2">and there&#39;s like this survivor one on</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.669" end="00:33:14.220" style="s2">the other way self-help people do this</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.980" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">to like and a lot of public speakers</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.220" end="00:33:17.309" style="s2">where it&#39;s like well I could do this I</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:19.019" style="s2">did look at me and my successful TED</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.309" end="00:33:21.419" style="s2">talk anyone can do this and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.019" end="00:33:23.490" style="s2">no actually only one in a thousand can</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.419" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">make it to where you are even trying and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.490" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">so but the more successful somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:30.029" style="s2">the more platform they have to say how</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:32.309" style="s2">they got to their success but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.029" end="00:33:33.929" style="s2">ever take the actual metrics okay but</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.309" end="00:33:36.570" style="s2">how many people did all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.929" end="00:33:38.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to success it&#39;s somehow your</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.570" end="00:33:40.590" style="s2">fault that you didn&#39;t write you did you</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.460" end="00:33:42.510" style="s2">woke up meditated Ran&#39;s and everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.590" end="00:33:44.190" style="s2">that Tony Robbins does but you never</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.510" end="00:33:45.799" style="s2">make it to Tony Robbins success in fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.190" end="00:33:48.450" style="s2">we never have more than one client</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.799" end="00:33:50.340" style="s2">that&#39;s not is it on you like you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.450" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">followed the rules and so I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.340" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">figuring out that the rules are</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:57.210" style="s2">completely broken and it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:58.710" style="s2">your own internal guide that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.210" end="00:34:00.330" style="s2">really base on anyone else cuz otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.710" end="00:34:01.860" style="s2">you&#39;re following the rules and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.330" end="00:34:03.960" style="s2">miserable because you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.860" end="00:34:06.149" style="s2">this success if you follow the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:06.929" style="s2">get the success which let&#39;s say 1% of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.149" end="00:34:08.790" style="s2">people do</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.929" end="00:34:10.980" style="s2">then you&#39;re the commercial for the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.790" end="00:34:12.540" style="s2">generation then you&#39;re like right look</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.980" end="00:34:13.589" style="s2">at me I got success because I followed</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.540" end="00:34:15.960" style="s2">these rules right but you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.589" end="00:34:18.510" style="s2">showcasing one in a hundred people what</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.960" end="00:34:20.450" style="s2">about the other 99 you didn&#39;t get there</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.510" end="00:34:25.619" style="s2">even though they followed the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.450" end="00:34:28.050" style="s2">if that makes make sense yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.619" end="00:34:31.649" style="s2">basically I mean this is your show um I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.050" end="00:34:34.679" style="s2">just was inspired to pop in and and say</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.649" end="00:34:38.250" style="s2">hi it&#39;s a lot easier than typing I saw</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.679" end="00:34:40.980" style="s2">your show yesterday and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.250" end="00:34:44.520" style="s2">really genuinely moved and inspired by</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.980" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2">your vulnerability it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.520" end="00:34:51.419" style="s2">that everybody is cut out to do but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:53.399" style="s2">think these times you know we all need</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.419" end="00:34:54.810" style="s2">to step up and be more vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.399" end="00:34:58.770" style="s2">each other if we want to form genuine</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.810" end="00:35:02.670" style="s2">connections um so yeah seeing you speak</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.770" end="00:35:05.250" style="s2">yesterday really it inspired me I guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.670" end="00:35:08.099" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been sort of shy and camera</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.250" end="00:35:09.960" style="s2">resistant you know and I spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.099" end="00:35:11.880" style="s2">time typing but not necessarily a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.960" end="00:35:15.569" style="s2">times speaking so my confidence in my</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.880" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">speaking is it the greatest no but it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.569" end="00:35:19.210" style="s2">something I&#39;ve been working on for some</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.010" style="s2">time though</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.210" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">I mean part like my main reason for</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.010" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">joining was just like introduce myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">and also I find out I woke up this</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:32.710" style="s2">morning and I found that I was genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">excited to see oh yeah Jubilee should be</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.710" end="00:35:37.660" style="s2">on I hope he gets a heart I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:41.020" style="s2">glad to see you&#39;re doing it because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.660" end="00:35:44.890" style="s2">know you know you expressed what it</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:49.690" style="s2">means to you yesterday how you you just</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.890" end="00:35:52.420" style="s2">want to have the structure or again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.690" end="00:35:55.300" style="s2">just doing my best to speak here yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.420" end="00:35:58.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s if I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.300" end="00:36:00.010" style="s2">nothing to the world except giving</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.359" end="00:36:02.050" style="s2">people permission to show up as they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.010" end="00:36:04.180" style="s2">I think I&#39;m doing a pretty fantastic job</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.050" end="00:36:06.730" style="s2">and that is although it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.180" end="00:36:08.349" style="s2">necessarily my purpose it&#39;s continually</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.730" end="00:36:10.119" style="s2">the feedback I get from other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.349" end="00:36:11.980" style="s2">like oh you are you&#39;re going live and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.119" end="00:36:14.650" style="s2">you&#39;re don&#39;t look professional so like I</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.980" end="00:36:16.900" style="s2">can do this too and I&#39;m like yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.650" end="00:36:19.690" style="s2">so anyone you were saying that um you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.900" end="00:36:20.859" style="s2">don&#39;t think you&#39;re you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.690" end="00:36:23.170" style="s2">your speech and you don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.859" end="00:36:24.810" style="s2">it&#39;s where you want it to be it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.170" end="00:36:28.030" style="s2">paraphrasing and what you just said and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.810" end="00:36:29.830" style="s2">I was just before I went live thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.030" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">about public speaking because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.830" end="00:36:32.109" style="s2">I&#39;m not great at it</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:34.060" style="s2">in fact I&#39;m much better at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.109" end="00:36:35.650" style="s2">conversation that I am broadcasting so</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.060" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">they to the camera but it&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.650" end="00:36:39.940" style="s2">iconic can do at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:42.220" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s like we have a choice do</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.940" end="00:36:44.050" style="s2">you play in it until you can get better</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.220" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">at it and just allow it to be what it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.050" end="00:36:50.290" style="s2">or how good do you have to be at it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:53.650" style="s2">before you attempt it right in public in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.290" end="00:36:55.210" style="s2">private and whatever whatever realm that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.650" end="00:36:58.300" style="s2">you&#39;re comfortable in it right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.210" end="00:37:00.940" style="s2">takes something to step up and join this</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.300" end="00:37:02.470" style="s2">even on voice right that you put</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.940" end="00:37:05.500" style="s2">yourself out there and it&#39;s vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.470" end="00:37:10.359" style="s2">to do that and I guess I would just</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.500" end="00:37:13.960" style="s2">invite everyone to play in the muck as</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.359" end="00:37:16.180" style="s2">much as possible like you can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.960" end="00:37:18.550" style="s2">learn to be part of a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.180" end="00:37:19.570" style="s2">speak better until you&#39;re part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.550" end="00:37:20.740" style="s2">I can tell you I&#39;ve been doing this for</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.570" end="00:37:22.540" style="s2">years that I&#39;m not learning to speak</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.740" end="00:37:24.760" style="s2">better because my brain can&#39;t pick the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.540" end="00:37:25.810" style="s2">word out so and it&#39;s gonna lose train of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.760" end="00:37:28.780" style="s2">thought and I have a lot of filler</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.810" end="00:37:32.349" style="s2">language I know from doing some of those</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.780" end="00:37:33.960" style="s2">masters sorry oh I was just gonna throw</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.349" end="00:37:41.619" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.960" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">one one factor to me having is that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.619" end="00:37:47.109" style="s2">was I was actually I have a DD so I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:50.140" style="s2">on adderall for like ten years of my</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.109" end="00:37:52.090" style="s2">life and I was a coder and I was able I</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.140" end="00:37:55.000" style="s2">was you know a pretty kick-ass oder in</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.090" end="00:37:56.650" style="s2">my opinion but like the adderall has</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.000" end="00:37:59.020" style="s2">side effects the physical side effects</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.650" end="00:38:04.060" style="s2">so for about a year now about a year ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.020" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">I went off of it and it&#39;s like I found</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.060" end="00:38:08.470" style="s2">that I just couldn&#39;t code anymore or at</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:10.150" style="s2">least I needed a break from and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.470" end="00:38:11.790" style="s2">trying to figure out okay can I go back</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.150" end="00:38:15.550" style="s2">and do this without being on that or oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.790" end="00:38:19.090" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.550" end="00:38:20.950" style="s2">iseman been my motivation mm-hmm and my</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.090" end="00:38:23.710" style="s2">confidence in speaking with people and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.950" end="00:38:25.980" style="s2">feeling like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.710" end="00:38:28.570" style="s2">oh my god I haven&#39;t been employed</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.980" end="00:38:31.030" style="s2">because I&#39;ve given myself that freedom</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.570" end="00:38:33.160" style="s2">to have that time off to recover and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.030" end="00:38:34.810" style="s2">was like well jeez can I can i code what</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.160" end="00:38:37.090" style="s2">there&#39;s been there&#39;s this pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.810" end="00:38:39.250" style="s2">it&#39;s okay like I was just gonna join</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.090" end="00:38:40.390" style="s2">that a service called TaskRabbit where</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.250" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">you just go and help people out with</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.390" end="00:38:46.930" style="s2">groceries simple but then the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:49.530" style="s2">hit and it&#39;s like well okay a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.930" end="00:38:54.520" style="s2">those tax or not advisable because of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.530" end="00:38:57.820" style="s2">contagion so you know I tried to figure</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.520" end="00:38:59.890" style="s2">out how can I contribute and I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.820" end="00:39:01.210" style="s2">realized like really being honest with</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.890" end="00:39:02.950" style="s2">myself and like watching your video</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.210" end="00:39:05.020" style="s2">yesterday okay I just need to take that</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.950" end="00:39:06.970" style="s2">baby step like starting to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.020" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.970" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">bake me some bread and like</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:17.580" style="s2">maybe if there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:19.320" style="s2">inspired by that I would be like I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.580" end="00:39:23.340" style="s2">be a little bit this really just all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.320" end="00:39:24.810" style="s2">complexity that got to be too much in</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.340" end="00:39:26.790" style="s2">the past but if it could be something</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.810" end="00:39:29.460" style="s2">it&#39;s relatively simple</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.790" end="00:39:33.000" style="s2">not like a huge team of people and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.460" end="00:39:36.390" style="s2">I could start can you not code now</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.000" end="00:39:38.460" style="s2">because how do I ask this because</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.390" end="00:39:41.970" style="s2">there&#39;s like an outside bar you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.460" end="00:39:43.560" style="s2">meet like the clients the boss you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.970" end="00:39:44.970" style="s2">let&#39;s say before it took you two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.560" end="00:39:47.670" style="s2">to code something to know it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.970" end="00:39:50.010" style="s2">take you six weeks or a month or is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.670" end="00:39:51.480" style="s2">that you can&#39;t even do a six-week prose</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.010" end="00:39:56.490" style="s2">like you can&#39;t even do it with triple or</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.480" end="00:39:59.640" style="s2">quadruple the time period it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.490" end="00:40:02.010" style="s2">there&#39;s some of that and there&#39;s some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.640" end="00:40:04.770" style="s2">just like psychological emotional like</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.010" end="00:40:08.490" style="s2">resistance like I&#39;m a computer I start</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.770" end="00:40:14.010" style="s2">to code and it&#39;s just like physically</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.490" end="00:40:15.710" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t want to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.010" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.710" end="00:40:20.550" style="s2">ya know which is an important thing to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">know I&#39;m also a IDI</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:26.670" style="s2">didn&#39;t get died I haven&#39;t gotten</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.869" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">diagnosed with autism but well I went in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.670" end="00:40:31.320" style="s2">to get a DD meds which I don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:33.330" style="s2">daily for other reasons but I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.320" end="00:40:34.830" style="s2">have for like once a week or once every</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.330" end="00:40:37.109" style="s2">couple weeks when I want to take them</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.830" end="00:40:38.580" style="s2">because I know that I&#39;m a DD and I know</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.109" end="00:40:40.140" style="s2">what I actually took one of my old</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.580" end="00:40:41.550" style="s2">roommates was that I was like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.140" end="00:40:44.580" style="s2">what this feels like to be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.550" end="00:40:46.109" style="s2">neurotypical and I can&#39;t do it daily</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.580" end="00:40:47.310" style="s2">because it hurts my sleep it has the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.109" end="00:40:49.230" style="s2">side effects so I can do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.310" end="00:40:54.060" style="s2">you know once once a week and pay that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.230" end="00:40:59.670" style="s2">price but I it is so common the people</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:41:03.180" style="s2">with a DB learn to cram information into</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.670" end="00:41:04.710" style="s2">their brain with adrenaline and we all</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.180" end="00:41:06.300" style="s2">eventually have a burr knows whether</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.710" end="00:41:07.800" style="s2">you&#39;re on medication or not you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.300" end="00:41:09.300" style="s2">medication eventually it stops like</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.800" end="00:41:10.650" style="s2">eventually you have to get off of it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.300" end="00:41:12.210" style="s2">then you have to figure out how your</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.650" end="00:41:14.190" style="s2">brain actually works without it when it</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.210" end="00:41:16.170" style="s2">was kind of addicted to substance to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.190" end="00:41:18.570" style="s2">work in a way the world wanted it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.170" end="00:41:20.010" style="s2">work and you wanted it to work or like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.570" end="00:41:21.390" style="s2">me you don&#39;t take it you figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.010" end="00:41:25.740" style="s2">your brain works and I can take it as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.390" end="00:41:27.030" style="s2">one-off but either way once I</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.740" end="00:41:31.500" style="s2">started truly embracing my</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.030" end="00:41:33.150" style="s2">neurodiversity where I allow my brain to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.500" end="00:41:35.190" style="s2">lose its train of thought I allow it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.150" end="00:41:37.530" style="s2">badd in autistic and whatever it shows</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.190" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">up in the moment it doesn&#39;t look the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.530" end="00:41:43.890" style="s2">best when public speaking but in doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:45.480" style="s2">so I&#39;ve tapped into a different part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.890" end="00:41:47.850" style="s2">my genius and a different part of my</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.480" end="00:41:49.350" style="s2">purpose that got me to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.850" end="00:41:51.660" style="s2">although I can&#39;t explain it because the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.350" end="00:41:53.010" style="s2">public speaking thing I think I know how</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.660" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">we can save the world and create me</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.010" end="00:41:57.510" style="s2">together and it&#39;s not a one it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:41:59.700" style="s2">come to me in a download ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.510" end="00:42:01.380" style="s2">and now it&#39;s like it&#39;s continual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.700" end="00:42:04.050" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s how we do that thing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.380" end="00:42:05.850" style="s2">that thing and that thing and if I the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.050" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">more I try to force it and try to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.850" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">what society or neurotypical I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">supposed to be it all breaks apart but</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:16.290" style="s2">when I just allow it I can feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:18.210" style="s2">genius in magic and it&#39;s not all day</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.290" end="00:42:20.630" style="s2">every day but it&#39;s like the sparks of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.210" end="00:42:22.530" style="s2">things that come up and so I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.630" end="00:42:24.360" style="s2">suggestion if you want to take it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.530" end="00:42:25.950" style="s2">that like there is something in your</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.360" end="00:42:27.990" style="s2">brain that doesn&#39;t necessarily need the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.950" end="00:42:30.600" style="s2">medication if you&#39;re not able to take it</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.990" end="00:42:32.850" style="s2">and when you let go of what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.600" end="00:42:36.690" style="s2">supposed to look like you get what it</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.850" end="00:42:39.930" style="s2">actually is and you might fit into</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.690" end="00:42:41.730" style="s2">society less but like the payoff as to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.930" end="00:42:44.580" style="s2">what you then can give from that space</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.730" end="00:42:46.020" style="s2">is huge and I don&#39;t because I&#39;m the only</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.580" end="00:42:48.180" style="s2">one I know who&#39;s like been through that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.020" end="00:42:51.750" style="s2">journey and my exact brain journey and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.180" end="00:42:54.450" style="s2">so much brain changes throughout my life</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.750" end="00:42:57.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if it works for other</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.450" end="00:42:58.980" style="s2">people but but there&#39;s so much magic and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.000" end="00:43:00.630" style="s2">possibility here that I&#39;m like it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.980" end="00:43:02.130" style="s2">not like there&#39;s something about when</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.630" end="00:43:05.790" style="s2">you live your own life and you allow</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.130" end="00:43:08.670" style="s2">things to just happen that you start to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.790" end="00:43:10.859" style="s2">realize there&#39;s something orchestrating</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.670" end="00:43:13.380" style="s2">something because it&#39;s way too weird for</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.859" end="00:43:15.720" style="s2">it not to be for it to be what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.380" end="00:43:19.230" style="s2">word like a coincidence on repeat like</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.720" end="00:43:22.109" style="s2">okay this is design that says I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.230" end="00:43:24.359" style="s2">analogy is like if a TD people are put</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.109" end="00:43:26.910" style="s2">and autistic people and brain damage and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.359" end="00:43:28.530" style="s2">any kind of neurodiversity are put here</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.910" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">to be exactly what they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.530" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">be we&#39;re supposed to have 15 thoughts at</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:33.810" style="s2">once and not be able to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:35.070" style="s2">communicate them we&#39;re supposed to let</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.810" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">the train and the trail kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.070" end="00:43:37.990" style="s2">derail and yet you all seem to build up</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:40.630" style="s2">a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.990" end="00:43:42.910" style="s2">able to actually have ideas that if</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.630" end="00:43:44.740" style="s2">they&#39;re who they&#39;re supposed to be and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.910" end="00:43:46.810" style="s2">if we allowed them to be who they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.740" end="00:43:51.250" style="s2">supposed to be we get their best self</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.810" end="00:43:53.170" style="s2">but all of society is about performance</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.250" end="00:43:54.910" style="s2">this is what you&#39;re supposed to be be it</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.170" end="00:43:56.590" style="s2">or you can&#39;t be it right you can&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.910" end="00:43:58.510" style="s2">for six weeks you have to code in two</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.590" end="00:44:00.220" style="s2">weeks or you can&#39;t do this you have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.510" end="00:44:02.980" style="s2">live off caffeine or you can&#39;t code you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.220" end="00:44:05.320" style="s2">have to instead of like what how can we</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.980" end="00:44:08.410" style="s2">support you - it&#39;s a lot of code you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.320" end="00:44:10.119" style="s2">about sustainable and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.410" end="00:44:12.910" style="s2">sustainable for anyone but the burnout</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.119" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">rate is higher of course for autistic</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.910" end="00:44:18.850" style="s2">and and and EDD people and there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:20.230" style="s2">of us coming through so like the 20 year</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.850" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">olds he come and still be on adderall</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.230" end="00:44:25.960" style="s2">and still you know play that game but</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:27.940" style="s2">once we hit late 30s 40s we can&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.960" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">the I don&#39;t know I&#39;m having been on</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.940" end="00:44:31.240" style="s2">medication fighting for my whole life I</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:34.080" style="s2">haven&#39;t been on medication all for an</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.240" end="00:44:36.220" style="s2">extended period of time for a TD but</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.080" end="00:44:37.810" style="s2">because I and I know how my brain works</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.220" end="00:44:38.830" style="s2">and I went through University and I went</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.810" end="00:44:41.110" style="s2">through high school and then when my</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.830" end="00:44:42.550" style="s2">brain changed from my brain tumors and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.110" end="00:44:43.750" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use the journal and in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.550" end="00:44:45.580" style="s2">different way that happens with AD</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.750" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">people I just clicked like my nervous</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.580" end="00:44:50.530" style="s2">system shuts down so I was like well I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">don&#39;t the tools I had to make my brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.530" end="00:44:56.859" style="s2">work no longer work what do I do and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:59.109" style="s2">turns out what I did was just surrender</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.859" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">to it like all right what do I got what</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.109" end="00:45:03.190" style="s2">do I got from this space because trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">to make it work for society or trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.190" end="00:45:09.540" style="s2">be a version of myself that would fit</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:12.160" style="s2">into society broke me in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.540" end="00:45:15.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know society never could like it</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.160" end="00:45:16.900" style="s2">was just I was breaking myself to fit in</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.160" end="00:45:19.240" style="s2">and once I stopped doing that it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.900" end="00:45:21.310" style="s2">like oh now I don&#39;t really care like I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.240" end="00:45:23.530" style="s2">don&#39;t care on and it was it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.310" end="00:45:25.480" style="s2">process like every cycle of the process</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.530" end="00:45:27.400" style="s2">is like I care a little less what other</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.480" end="00:45:30.130" style="s2">people think of me and I know a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.400" end="00:45:31.720" style="s2">more who I actually am and every time it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.130" end="00:45:33.220" style="s2">proves itself more and more of like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.720" end="00:45:35.230" style="s2">get this piece when I do this and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.220" end="00:45:38.980" style="s2">piece when I do this so anyway that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.230" end="00:45:41.350" style="s2">me running on for a while but yeah one</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.980" end="00:45:44.170" style="s2">thing that I have found does help me</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.350" end="00:45:47.890" style="s2">with virtually no side effects though is</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.170" end="00:45:50.610" style="s2">the it&#39;s qualia have you heard of qualia</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.890" end="00:45:53.080" style="s2">the neurotropic sac</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.610" end="00:45:56.050" style="s2">now that out there by a neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.080" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">collective which Daniel Schwarzenberg er</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.050" end="00:46:00.340" style="s2">is like he&#39;s one of the office not the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:02.680" style="s2">CEO but he&#39;s like I think his brother is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.340" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">this via that&#39;s how I found Daniel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.680" end="00:46:10.690" style="s2">watching Berger actually um but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:13.060" style="s2">definitely helps me work with clarity</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.690" end="00:46:14.470" style="s2">and focus I highly recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.060" end="00:46:17.910" style="s2">you know for anyone who can afford it</p>

<p begin="00:46:17.910" end="00:46:21.250" style="s2">this is just me following my own</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.750" end="00:46:22.690" style="s2">guidance in no way if it&#39;s helping you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.250" end="00:46:24.250" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome but like I got the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.690" end="00:46:25.960" style="s2">guidance a long time ago then unless it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.250" end="00:46:28.210" style="s2">was free or cheap I&#39;m not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.960" end="00:46:29.890" style="s2">something I&#39;m doing for my brain so like</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.210" end="00:46:32.350" style="s2">if Daniel or Jordan wanted to be like</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.350" end="00:46:38.080" style="s2">try it but and give my honest feedback</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.950" end="00:46:41.950" style="s2">as to whether or not three months in it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.080" end="00:46:44.470" style="s2">helped in any way but I find placebo and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.950" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">nocebo effect are way too strong in in</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.470" end="00:46:48.370" style="s2">my life and so I was spending a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:49.840" style="s2">money my family&#39;s obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.370" end="00:46:51.550" style="s2">supplements and even now I&#39;ll take I</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.550" end="00:46:55.360" style="s2">off anyway</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.360" end="00:46:57.730" style="s2">it&#39;ll be like double it triple it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.360" end="00:46:59.620" style="s2">quadruple it I&#39;m like no that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.730" end="00:47:01.240" style="s2">diminishing rate of returns we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.620" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">nutrients but like how many do you need</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.240" end="00:47:05.710" style="s2">and how expensive it is it and why is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:10.320" style="s2">so expensive and what is it to eat and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.710" end="00:47:14.170" style="s2">can power in a game a model of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.320" end="00:47:15.790" style="s2">supplements are $60 a month in game B</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.170" end="00:47:17.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like the very people who need it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.790" end="00:47:21.370" style="s2">the most people who are brain-damaged</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.380" end="00:47:23.080" style="s2">people who have had a brain events that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.370" end="00:47:25.240" style="s2">that changes their brain and people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.080" end="00:47:26.710" style="s2">are born neurodiverse could be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.240" end="00:47:28.180" style="s2">people who could use it the most and yet</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.710" end="00:47:30.130" style="s2">at the same time they&#39;re often the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.180" end="00:47:32.380" style="s2">people who can&#39;t afford it right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.130" end="00:47:33.730" style="s2">less likely to be as employed at a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.380" end="00:47:35.800" style="s2">higher level if you&#39;re a BD and not on</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.730" end="00:47:38.020" style="s2">medication if you&#39;re autistic if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.800" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">definitely brain damaged which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.020" end="00:47:40.990" style="s2">put any other two I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">other two every damage but I have all</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.990" end="00:47:48.730" style="s2">300 on trios um that like if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:50.440" style="s2">truly what we need to make our brains</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.730" end="00:47:52.630" style="s2">work then it needs to be accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.440" end="00:47:54.010" style="s2">everyone which means we need to swap</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.630" end="00:47:56.260" style="s2">supply and demand instead of like are</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.010" end="00:47:57.820" style="s2">you willing to pay $60 for it how much</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.260" end="00:47:59.890" style="s2">does it cost us to make it how many</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.820" end="00:48:01.630" style="s2">people want it and at what price point</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.890" end="00:48:03.100" style="s2">how many people do we need to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.630" end="00:48:03.750" style="s2">down to that price point because I</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.100" end="00:48:06.210" style="s2">guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.750" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">basically no drug unless they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.210" end="00:48:10.740" style="s2">they cost 60 bucks a month to produce it</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">should be I don&#39;t know 20 bucks or less</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.740" end="00:48:16.050" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think even</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:18.120" style="s2">transparent so then you can no sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.050" end="00:48:20.370" style="s2">said I don&#39;t know you&#39;d have to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.120" end="00:48:23.430" style="s2">them about why they priced it at that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.370" end="00:48:26.610" style="s2">but I know it used to be like 150 and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.430" end="00:48:27.900" style="s2">they brought it down but I mean it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.610" end="00:48:31.890" style="s2">in my mind I think it&#39;s a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.900" end="00:48:33.900" style="s2">that&#39;s doing but yeah obviously in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.890" end="00:48:36.510" style="s2">ideal gaming world sure you know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.900" end="00:48:38.370" style="s2">everybody gets it for free but I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.510" end="00:48:41.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know is the first step you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.370" end="00:48:43.800" style="s2">you often need to start a game a world</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.930" end="00:48:48.150" style="s2">figure out how to make a sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.800" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">economy I mean I&#39;m going a different a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.150" end="00:48:53.430" style="s2">different route but because that is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:54.870" style="s2">part of my issue is right so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.430" end="00:48:56.190" style="s2">play a game in order to get enough money</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.870" end="00:48:57.930" style="s2">in order to put food on the table in</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.190" end="00:49:01.020" style="s2">order to be able to say like have space</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.930" end="00:49:02.730" style="s2">to be able to play game b-but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.020" end="00:49:05.820" style="s2">think the people who are successful in</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.730" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">game a actually know how to create game</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.820" end="00:49:10.200" style="s2">B and I mean all of them I mean Daniel I</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:12.810" style="s2">mean Jordan I mean like as brilliant as</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.200" end="00:49:15.780" style="s2">they are in starting it and catalyzing</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.810" end="00:49:17.100" style="s2">it they actually don&#39;t know how to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.780" end="00:49:18.600" style="s2">there because that hurts their business</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.100" end="00:49:20.220" style="s2">right if this is how I put food on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.600" end="00:49:22.080" style="s2">table and this is how I do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.220" end="00:49:24.030" style="s2">I can&#39;t envision a world where this</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.080" end="00:49:25.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist even if it would be more</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.030" end="00:49:27.300" style="s2">powerful even if that would help more</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.410" end="00:49:29.730" style="s2">people even if it&#39;s like you just have</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.300" end="00:49:32.130" style="s2">these blocks to to those solutions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.730" end="00:49:35.070" style="s2">the people who it doesn&#39;t work for who</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.130" end="00:49:36.780" style="s2">in my experience can can create a new a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.070" end="00:49:37.920" style="s2">new system but then they don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.780" end="00:49:40.410" style="s2">to implement it because they&#39;re not game</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.920" end="00:49:46.110" style="s2">a people and so it&#39;s about finding that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.410" end="00:49:48.300" style="s2">process finding the finding how we get</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.110" end="00:49:52.170" style="s2">the best ideas out there how if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.300" end="00:49:55.020" style="s2">in business if you&#39;re in life for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.170" end="00:49:58.110" style="s2">purpose let&#39;s say you create a brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.020" end="00:49:59.720" style="s2">drug and are you in it to make money or</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.110" end="00:50:02.040" style="s2">you in it to help people&#39;s neuro health</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.720" end="00:50:04.380" style="s2">because you can only serve one of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.040" end="00:50:05.730" style="s2">masters so it doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.380" end="00:50:06.990" style="s2">profitable right I&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.730" end="00:50:08.820" style="s2">giving it away for free I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.990" end="00:50:11.610" style="s2">about having transparency on the cost</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.820" end="00:50:12.960" style="s2">and showcasing that it&#39;s as close to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.610" end="00:50:14.910" style="s2">that as possible that it takes to run</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.960" end="00:50:15.890" style="s2">the company and to pay us play our staff</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.910" end="00:50:18.579" style="s2">a living wage</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.890" end="00:50:21.470" style="s2">everyone in this in the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.579" end="00:50:23.989" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a very different process</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.470" end="00:50:26.299" style="s2">than like oh and we priced her to 150</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.989" end="00:50:28.730" style="s2">and not enough people were buying it so</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.299" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">we moved it to 60 it&#39;s you can make that</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.730" end="00:50:35.420" style="s2">decision yeah sorry I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:37.670" style="s2">that&#39;s the case yeah no no you can undo</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.420" end="00:50:39.710" style="s2">this by I you can also if your purpose</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.670" end="00:50:41.269" style="s2">is to help more people maybe they moved</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.710" end="00:50:45.739" style="s2">it down to 60 because they realize they</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.269" end="00:50:47.630" style="s2">could use like let&#39;s say under 150 model</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.739" end="00:50:49.640" style="s2">you&#39;re making a million dollars profit a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.630" end="00:50:51.470" style="s2">year and under the sixty dollar model</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.640" end="00:50:52.519" style="s2">you&#39;re selling to way more people and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.470" end="00:50:54.380" style="s2">you&#39;re also making a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.519" end="00:50:55.999" style="s2">profit here of course it makes sense if</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.380" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">you&#39;re in any way attached to your</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.999" end="00:51:01.430" style="s2">purpose to have more customers and move</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:05.059" style="s2">over to this short but less expensive</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.430" end="00:51:07.670" style="s2">but if moving to $60 meant you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.059" end="00:51:10.279" style="s2">impact a hundred fold times but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.670" end="00:51:13.460" style="s2">brought your your profit from a million</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.279" end="00:51:14.539" style="s2">down to let&#39;s say 750 thousand would you</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.460" end="00:51:16.519" style="s2">make that decision</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.539" end="00:51:18.410" style="s2">you&#39;re still profitable even away and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.519" end="00:51:20.650" style="s2">that&#39;s the question and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.410" end="00:51:22.369" style="s2">most game a business people</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.650" end="00:51:24.799" style="s2">understandably would make the decision</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.369" end="00:51:27.410" style="s2">to make less profit even if it had more</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.799" end="00:51:28.970" style="s2">purpose and that is if it&#39;s equal I</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.410" end="00:51:31.220" style="s2">think everyone&#39;s gonna choose to have</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.970" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">more purpose but when it costs you your</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.220" end="00:51:36.680" style="s2">profit which is your master which one is</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:38.119" style="s2">the one you&#39;re gonna choose and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.680" end="00:51:40.700" style="s2">saying they did one or the other just</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.119" end="00:51:43.220" style="s2">that when you&#39;re playing that game if</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.700" end="00:51:44.839" style="s2">you&#39;re not even aware of it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.220" end="00:51:48.140" style="s2">it&#39;s like well no think about all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.839" end="00:51:49.640" style="s2">good I could do for $250,000 right but</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.140" end="00:51:51.079" style="s2">is the good you&#39;re doing the reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.640" end="00:51:52.430" style="s2">you&#39;re in business if the reason you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.079" end="00:51:54.980" style="s2">in business is to help people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.430" end="00:51:57.369" style="s2">neurological function and you can impact</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.980" end="00:51:59.450" style="s2">more people what could you do with that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.369" end="00:52:00.890" style="s2">250,000 that isn&#39;t that right then you</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:12.289" style="s2">of profit but you can&#39;t do neither right</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.980" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">less right you need to have although you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.289" end="00:52:17.869" style="s2">only have one master you serve you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:20.539" style="s2">to acknowledge both of them you can&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.069" end="00:52:27.559" style="s2">gonna piss everyone off and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.119" end="00:52:29.240" style="s2">gonna give you money right it&#39;s so like</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.559" end="00:52:30.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a balancing act</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.240" end="00:52:32.090" style="s2">but it&#39;s which one is your master which</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.800" end="00:52:35.090" style="s2">one is your bottom line what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:52:45.770" end="00:52:51.950" style="s2">if they gave it to me for free of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.570" end="00:52:54.700" style="s2">absolutely like to see what this does</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.950" end="00:52:57.470" style="s2">for you because that&#39;s also I mean</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.470" end="00:53:04.130" style="s2">potential to help in a really big way</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:05.210" style="s2">then like pharmaceuticals and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.130" end="00:53:06.980" style="s2">don&#39;t because they&#39;re about keeping you</p>

<p begin="00:53:06.980" end="00:53:11.540" style="s2">baseline or better than baseline versus</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.540" end="00:53:16.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t need to be corrected it has all</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.890" end="00:53:20.680" style="s2">these side effects one one point that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.460" end="00:53:20.680" style="s2">was welcomed a TD one sake</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.150" end="00:53:30.670" style="s2">definitely know hardly anything about</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.580" end="00:53:33.470" style="s2">hurricanes but I did watch the talk gave</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.670" end="00:53:35.450" style="s2">in which the general concept was like</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.470" end="00:53:38.090" style="s2">everything that they put in in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.450" end="00:53:39.740" style="s2">Sequoia is like designed to help the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.090" end="00:53:42.110" style="s2">brain do what it already does better</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.740" end="00:53:46.070" style="s2">like the whole different philosophy then</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.110" end="00:53:47.810" style="s2">say a certain antidepressants or other</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.070" end="00:53:51.320" style="s2">drugs which like target forget a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.810" end="00:53:52.910" style="s2">specific receptor philosophy being that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.320" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">the brain is a complex system so you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.910" end="00:53:59.260" style="s2">expect like one variable and fix the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.260" style="s2">problem it&#39;s going to affect all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.180" end="00:54:06.110" style="s2">signal of what it&#39;s already doing I know</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:07.490" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a vague description but</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.110" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.490" end="00:54:12.650" style="s2">ya know and that&#39;s again I don&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:14.600" style="s2">I do know a little bit about neurology</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.650" end="00:54:17.210" style="s2">because of my health system and cuz my</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.600" end="00:54:18.590" style="s2">background is in biology but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.210" end="00:54:21.830" style="s2">know enough to know whether or not that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.590" end="00:54:24.350" style="s2">is true or not right like whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.830" end="00:54:25.910" style="s2">and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.350" end="00:54:27.320" style="s2">and Jordan watching them speak is</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.910" end="00:54:29.840" style="s2">speaking to Jordan I&#39;ve never spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.320" end="00:54:32.330" style="s2">Daniel I don&#39;t think they&#39;re nefarious</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.840" end="00:54:34.760" style="s2">in any way shape or form I just think</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.330" end="00:54:36.470" style="s2">it&#39;s natural when you have your food and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.760" end="00:54:37.970" style="s2">shelter provided by something for you</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.470" end="00:54:40.580" style="s2">not to be able to see everything and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.970" end="00:54:42.770" style="s2">what yeah I I would say I think that</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.580" end="00:54:44.750" style="s2">would be a very good conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.770" end="00:54:49.250" style="s2">for somebody to have there&#39;s some point</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.750" end="00:54:55.270" style="s2">of time or maybe they have it yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.250" end="00:54:59.030" style="s2">it business some degree is in direct</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.270" end="00:55:02.810" style="s2">opposition to be right well or at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.030" end="00:55:05.060" style="s2">the way it currently is yeah and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.810" end="00:55:08.840" style="s2">that&#39;s like especially for brains in</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.060" end="00:55:11.270" style="s2">general there&#39;s this idea that what a</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.840" end="00:55:12.440" style="s2">peak brain looks like right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.270" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">want to get as close to that as possible</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.440" end="00:55:16.970" style="s2">and I think that very assumption is</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:18.920" style="s2">broken and this is why if game a works</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.970" end="00:55:21.350" style="s2">for you you can envision game B as</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.920" end="00:55:23.030" style="s2">somebody who I&#39;ve had autism my whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.350" end="00:55:24.860" style="s2">life without knowing it cuz I Lin knew</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.030" end="00:55:26.900" style="s2">it last year I&#39;ve had a DD my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.860" end="00:55:29.450" style="s2">with knowing it and I&#39;ve had brain</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.900" end="00:55:31.400" style="s2">damage since that is like an ongoing it</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.450" end="00:55:32.570" style="s2">still is is getting worse and worse from</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.400" end="00:55:35.840" style="s2">my brain swelling after brain surgery</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.570" end="00:55:39.550" style="s2">and I go and or going radiation and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.840" end="00:55:43.369" style="s2">gene and B tamam and all this stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.550" end="00:55:45.470" style="s2">there is something I&#39;ve tapped into by</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.369" end="00:55:48.350" style="s2">going with what my brain is that I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.470" end="00:55:50.540" style="s2">never have if I needed it to act a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.350" end="00:55:52.970" style="s2">certain way and so although taking a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.540" end="00:55:54.590" style="s2">supplement again totally valid if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.970" end="00:55:57.050" style="s2">helping you reach peak the fact we want</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.590" end="00:55:58.580" style="s2">everyone to reach peak is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.050" end="00:56:01.100" style="s2">because you&#39;re not giving who you are</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.580" end="00:56:02.570" style="s2">you&#39;re giving what we think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.100" end="00:56:04.550" style="s2">supposed to give which is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.570" end="00:56:06.050" style="s2">taking the ATD medication to improve</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.550" end="00:56:08.570" style="s2">your brain without the side effects I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.050" end="00:56:10.280" style="s2">think having it available it cost so</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.570" end="00:56:12.619" style="s2">there&#39;s an it&#39;s an option for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.280" end="00:56:13.820" style="s2">and that cost there can be waste off put</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.619" end="00:56:15.619" style="s2">it even if you can&#39;t afford 20 bucks a</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.820" end="00:56:17.810" style="s2">month but if it&#39;s available to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.619" end="00:56:18.710" style="s2">because it does truly help otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.810" end="00:56:20.540" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.710" end="00:56:23.570" style="s2">something like anyone who could afford</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.540" end="00:56:25.730" style="s2">60 bucks a month for it for a drug that</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.570" end="00:56:27.670" style="s2">is optional right it&#39;s not your diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.730" end="00:56:30.980" style="s2">medication is going to keep you alive</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.670" end="00:56:33.619" style="s2">probably has a somewhat affluent history</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.980" end="00:56:36.380" style="s2">and existing life right they probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.619" end="00:56:38.780" style="s2">weren&#39;t born in a flow Bella they</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.380" end="00:56:40.280" style="s2">probably weren&#39;t like those are the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.780" end="00:56:41.570" style="s2">people who need it even more cuz they</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.280" end="00:56:42.830" style="s2">didn&#39;t have adequate nutrition when they</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.570" end="00:56:44.750" style="s2">were a kid but are the very people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.830" end="00:56:46.490" style="s2">can&#39;t afford it and so it&#39;s like either</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.750" end="00:56:47.690" style="s2">this is important and we want everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.490" end="00:56:51.369" style="s2">brain working at peak which means</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.690" end="00:56:53.990" style="s2">everyone needs this or it&#39;s just a new</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.369" end="00:56:55.369" style="s2">piece of privilege that the privileged</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.990" end="00:56:56.280" style="s2">to get right that&#39;s like well if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.369" end="00:56:58.410" style="s2">could afford this you</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.280" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">get even better you can get an end right</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.410" end="00:57:04.200" style="s2">which could potentially make the gap</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:06.060" style="s2">between rich and poor even greater right</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.200" end="00:57:07.320" style="s2">instead of like just embracing your</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.060" end="00:57:09.840" style="s2">brain is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.320" end="00:57:11.580" style="s2">who you are is exactly what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.840" end="00:57:13.560" style="s2">give the world there&#39;s this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.580" end="00:57:15.270" style="s2">can improve your brain do you want it to</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.560" end="00:57:18.150" style="s2">be improved and then it&#39;s not Gattaca</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.270" end="00:57:20.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not survival of the richest fittest</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.150" end="00:57:22.680" style="s2">smartest it&#39;s like who are you and how</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.670" end="00:57:25.530" style="s2">can we help you reach what you feel is</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.680" end="00:57:27.960" style="s2">your peak in mental and physical in</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.530" end="00:57:29.340" style="s2">whatever you want to focus on because</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.960" end="00:57:31.230" style="s2">there&#39;s also just that focus right some</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.340" end="00:57:32.820" style="s2">people don&#39;t care about their mental and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.230" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not supposed to and other people</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.820" end="00:57:37.830" style="s2">like I don&#39;t necessarily care about my</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:39.600" style="s2">physical so much kind of paying the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.830" end="00:57:43.020" style="s2">price for that but that&#39;s that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.600" end="00:57:44.940" style="s2">but it&#39;s a that we if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.020" end="00:57:46.620" style="s2">in me that screams so loudly that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.940" end="00:57:48.800" style="s2">need the diversity that exists on this</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.620" end="00:57:51.780" style="s2">planet we&#39;re not all supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.800" end="00:57:53.910" style="s2">improving ourselves to some outside</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.780" end="00:57:57.390" style="s2">ideal we&#39;re supposed to be looking</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.910" end="00:57:58.380" style="s2">inside to if to accept and love</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.390" end="00:58:00.390" style="s2">ourselves as we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.380" end="00:58:02.250" style="s2">and then that&#39;s naturally how it leads</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.390" end="00:58:04.740" style="s2">to progression and then whatever comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.250" end="00:58:07.200" style="s2">out of that is what&#39;s supposed to come</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.740" end="00:58:10.110" style="s2">out of it as opposed to who do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.200" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">be who do and then trying to be that and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.110" end="00:58:12.510" style="s2">tried you know what I mean I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:13.890" style="s2">someone who doesn&#39;t lose my train of</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.510" end="00:58:15.540" style="s2">thought I want to be someone who sounds</p>

<p begin="01:00:47.460" end="01:00:50.070" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s like this is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.870" end="01:00:51.990" style="s2">thing I&#39;m supposed to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.070" end="01:00:54.750" style="s2">consult the consultation of your doctor</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.990" end="01:00:56.610" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s not one prescription that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:01:11.070" end="01:01:17.070" style="s2">think we&#39;re about to see a society that</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.720" end="01:01:20.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have access to the</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.349" end="01:01:32.239" style="s2">in six months to a year right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.529" end="01:01:34.339" style="s2">different society and we have to switch</p>
