<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.549" style="s2">I am overwhelmed and overwhelmed by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.990" end="00:00:09.480" style="s2">amount of information that has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.549" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">coming at me always but for the last two</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.480" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">weeks especially since Trump has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:15.960" style="s2">into office it&#39;s just saying after</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">saying executive order after executive</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">order and firings and protests and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:23.640" style="s2">tweets and it&#39;s overwhelming and I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">our current way of staying up to den up</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:29.070" style="s2">to date on current events isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:31.410" style="s2">anymore it doesn&#39;t work for me it leaves</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.070" end="00:00:34.500" style="s2">me overwhelmed and like I have this tiny</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.410" end="00:00:36.420" style="s2">bit of information on dozens if not</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.500" end="00:00:40.620" style="s2">hundreds of topics instead of being able</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.420" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">to know for certain or certain as</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.620" end="00:00:47.879" style="s2">possible what is going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">and I think both sides need it we need a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:53.550" style="s2">place to go that is a board we were able</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">to verify facts and discuss the context</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.550" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">around those facts without discussing</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">the actual opinion and implication of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">those facts that can happen once we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:07.500" style="s2">agreed on the facts like one facts I</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">need to be buried all but one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.500" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">agreed that those are that the facts</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">exist there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">alternative fact and so two of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:24.930" style="s2">instances I&#39;ve seen and since Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">inauguration that are more great area</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.930" end="00:01:29.909" style="s2">not even but like that I can see it from</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">the other side or at least why the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.909" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">side has the opinions they do one is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">picture in an arguer of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">inaugurations of Obama and Trump side by</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">side I don&#39;t think you can dispute there</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">are more people in the obama one</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:48.119" style="s2">supposedly people out but there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">people but then the context around those</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.119" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">photos i think can be disputed me</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">discussed what time of day were the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">photos taken what time of day was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">speeches were they taken I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">what time adidas features were what kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">of weather was out on both days and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">greater historical context I would like</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">to know similar photos at similar times</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">a day for both bush and Clinton as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:18.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s not even that important to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">the news story all the things that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.540" end="00:02:22.019" style="s2">happened since inauguration day I feel</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:23.579" style="s2">it more important to be able to verify</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.019" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">the facts be like there&#39;s these two</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.579" end="00:02:31.250" style="s2">pictures when were they taken how Renee</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:34.019" style="s2">taken one of the other headlines was um</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.250" end="00:02:37.609" style="s2">entire senior management staff the US</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.019" end="00:02:40.950" style="s2">State Department resigned and big deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.609" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">except that when dozens of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.950" end="00:02:45.980" style="s2">reported it on Facebook there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">comment on one of their their news feeds</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.980" end="00:02:53.389" style="s2">that that&#39;s normal that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:55.829" style="s2">when a new president takes over is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.389" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">certain positions resign and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.829" end="00:03:01.819" style="s2">president then appoints or elec whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:04.079" style="s2">appoints people to that position</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.819" end="00:03:07.019" style="s2">sometimes he rehires the old ones as an</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.079" end="00:03:09.859" style="s2">MC has new one or it could have been she</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.019" end="00:03:13.739" style="s2">but let&#39;s be clear if you okay so he</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.859" end="00:03:15.329" style="s2">elects anyway so that&#39;s normal then</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.739" end="00:03:17.219" style="s2">there&#39;s people who say that it&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.329" end="00:03:20.009" style="s2">unprecedented levels will those are both</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.219" end="00:03:24.150" style="s2">verifiable I would like to know under</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.009" end="00:03:26.849" style="s2">Trump under Obama again also under Bush</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.150" end="00:03:29.489" style="s2">and Clinton how many people resign in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.849" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">each department both total numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.489" end="00:03:34.859" style="s2">percentages and is that normal is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:37.319" style="s2">unprecedented is unprecedented that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.859" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">there&#39;s two percent more it&#39;s like 90</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.319" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">versus ninety-two percent of people or</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.120" style="s2">is it like five percent you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">resign and now it&#39;s like ninety-five</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.120" end="00:03:46.709" style="s2">percent those are very different and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:52.199" style="s2">it&#39;s not just click bait it&#39;s verifiable</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.709" end="00:03:55.139" style="s2">fact I want to know what is going on I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.199" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">want to know who what air strikes are</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.139" end="00:04:01.049" style="s2">happening where and by whom to whom I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:03.659" style="s2">want to know what protests are happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.049" end="00:04:05.849" style="s2">who was being protested what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.659" end="00:04:09.689" style="s2">law enforcement wise against or for</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.689" end="00:04:14.359" style="s2">going on in a more verifiable way where</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.969" end="00:04:17.489" style="s2">it&#39;s not just opinion and what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.359" end="00:04:22.469" style="s2">discussed about facts that were somehow</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.489" end="00:04:24.719" style="s2">able to twist and alters to say what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.469" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">want them to say and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.719" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">susceptible to it or susceptible to the</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:38.850" style="s2">able to verify that what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.940" end="00:04:42.060" style="s2">about how accurate is it has it been</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.850" end="00:04:44.940" style="s2">disproven has it been is there something</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.060" end="00:04:47.700" style="s2">currently that has is more relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.940" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">this exact topic and I think we can do</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.700" end="00:04:53.640" style="s2">that with one website that we all own</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:55.530" style="s2">and we can contribute to where we talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.640" end="00:04:58.470" style="s2">about the facts we can have discussions</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.530" end="00:05:01.350" style="s2">about what those facts mean but that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.470" end="00:05:05.040" style="s2">there&#39;s one place for the facts you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.350" end="00:05:07.470" style="s2">go to selling posts to pictures side by</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.040" end="00:05:10.140" style="s2">side of two different observations eight</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.470" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">years apart someone else can post that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.140" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">same picture on the site and we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:17.310" style="s2">about when it was taken and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:21.030" style="s2">difference in timeline and what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.310" end="00:05:22.740" style="s2">means and so we can&#39;t have the media</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.030" end="00:05:26.660" style="s2">spin we can&#39;t have the new president</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.740" end="00:05:29.370" style="s2">spin we have actual verifiable fact in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.660" end="00:05:31.230" style="s2">way that we can easily see what is going</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.370" end="00:05:33.950" style="s2">on right now and what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.230" end="00:05:36.660" style="s2">no matter which side you&#39;re on if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.950" end="00:05:38.820" style="s2">riding against can mature supporting him</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.660" end="00:05:41.700" style="s2">if you&#39;re whatever it happens to be I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.820" end="00:05:43.920" style="s2">want a space where facts are verifiable</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.700" end="00:05:47.150" style="s2">because there is no such thing as</p>
