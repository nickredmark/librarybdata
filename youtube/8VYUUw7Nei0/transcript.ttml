<p begin="00:03:18.709" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">Hey thank you it&#39;s always a pleasure to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.920" end="00:03:26.530" style="s2">get a chance to speak with an educator</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:30.170" style="s2">and to kind of speak to other educators</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.530" end="00:03:32.209" style="s2">so a few words about me let&#39;s see I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.170" end="00:03:35.569" style="s2">what is sometimes referred to as a high</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.209" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">achieving dyslexic and so I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.569" end="00:03:42.440" style="s2">kind of a strange relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:43.610" style="s2">schools from a very young age for so for</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.440" end="00:03:45.230" style="s2">a long time I looked at schools a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.610" end="00:03:47.510" style="s2">bit differently because I was in all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.230" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">the special education programs first in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.510" end="00:03:55.069" style="s2">New Jersey that in Massachusetts and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:57.049" style="s2">you know that led to me have a natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.069" end="00:03:59.299" style="s2">curiosity I think about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.049" end="00:04:01.190" style="s2">learning because I was told by my mom</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.299" end="00:04:04.310" style="s2">who was a special educator and then via</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.190" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">the great you know the great teachers</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.310" end="00:04:09.350" style="s2">that I had that I learned differently</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:11.510" style="s2">than other students and so right away I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.350" end="00:04:14.750" style="s2">thinking well there&#39;s not one way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.510" end="00:04:18.410" style="s2">learn right and I was noticing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:19.940" style="s2">people who learn different ways and etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.410" end="00:04:21.979" style="s2">and so I went on this kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.940" end="00:04:24.520" style="s2">non-traditional learning trajectory I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.979" end="00:04:27.620" style="s2">taught myself music and began to read</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.520" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">way outside of classes even in high</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.620" end="00:04:31.450" style="s2">school ended up going to Hampshire</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:33.500" style="s2">College which is also unique</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.450" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">undergraduate institution where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.500" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">no tests and there&#39;s no grades and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:38.840" style="s2">don&#39;t get you know you get these long</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:40.580" style="s2">written reports and so I went there</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.840" end="00:04:42.590" style="s2">because of that I wanted every kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.580" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">mean yeah totally and that&#39;s why I went</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.590" end="00:04:45.530" style="s2">there because I hate an F you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:47.900" style="s2">actually as a senior in high school I</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.530" end="00:04:50.150" style="s2">wrote or maybe a junior I wrote a letter</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.900" end="00:04:54.380" style="s2">and circulated to the administrators of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.150" end="00:04:55.760" style="s2">the high school protesting the SAT and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.380" end="00:04:57.590" style="s2">specifically the monopoly of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.760" end="00:05:00.550" style="s2">Educational Testing Services that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.590" end="00:05:04.030" style="s2">well received by a couple</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.550" end="00:05:05.560" style="s2">but not by the key people anyway so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.030" end="00:05:07.330" style="s2">went to Hampshire because of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.560" end="00:05:10.419" style="s2">because I knew it would be a crazy place</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.330" end="00:05:13.389" style="s2">and it was and then I managed to go from</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.419" end="00:05:15.819" style="s2">Hampshire to Harvard which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.389" end="00:05:18.970" style="s2">an interesting move so I I didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.819" end="00:05:23.710" style="s2">GPA leaving undergraduate hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.970" end="00:05:26.680" style="s2">and bomb the GRE and through sheer force</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.710" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">of will and kind of getting really close</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.680" end="00:05:31.539" style="s2">contact with a couple key professors and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.560" end="00:05:33.550" style="s2">of course the you know the writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.539" end="00:05:35.169" style="s2">sample etc like I managed to get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.550" end="00:05:38.650" style="s2">the master&#39;s program and then the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.169" end="00:05:40.300" style="s2">doctoral program at Harvard and there I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.650" end="00:05:43.419" style="s2">continued my habit of reading way</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.300" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">outside of classes and ended up writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.419" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">a dissertation that became a book</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:50.169" style="s2">immediately published through Routledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:54.039" style="s2">on social justice and standardized</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.169" end="00:05:56.620" style="s2">testing at the same time in graduate</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.039" end="00:05:59.379" style="s2">school I was working with dr. Theo</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.620" end="00:06:01.810" style="s2">Dawson who I met at Hampshire to to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.379" end="00:06:03.819" style="s2">build a nonprofit that could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.810" end="00:06:06.430" style="s2">change the whole standardized testing</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.819" end="00:06:09.099" style="s2">infrastructure but that&#39;s called electic</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.430" end="00:06:13.690" style="s2">a-- Theo still runs that and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.099" end="00:06:16.360" style="s2">strong it&#39;s great work and so I stepped</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.690" end="00:06:20.169" style="s2">back from Lepke in order to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.360" end="00:06:22.509" style="s2">write and to do freelance scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.169" end="00:06:24.759" style="s2">essentially and so I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.509" end="00:06:26.500" style="s2">with think-tanks focused on cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.759" end="00:06:28.990" style="s2">reform specifically the Center for</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.500" end="00:06:32.050" style="s2">integral wisdom and I&#39;ve got a seat as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.990" end="00:06:34.449" style="s2">scholar at the Ronin Institute which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.050" end="00:06:38.349" style="s2">very interesting again non traditional</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.449" end="00:06:41.110" style="s2">academic institution that&#39;s housing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.349" end="00:06:43.719" style="s2">bunch of scholars who for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.110" end="00:06:47.259" style="s2">reason don&#39;t want to be or cannot be in</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.719" end="00:06:48.729" style="s2">the traditional Academy and so I spend</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.259" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">most of my days writing and doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.729" end="00:06:54.849" style="s2">consulting and speaking around issues of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:57.699" style="s2">Education education reform I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.849" end="00:07:01.090" style="s2">particularly concerned with the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.699" end="00:07:03.659" style="s2">current rapid transformations in global</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.090" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">culture and identity formation</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.659" end="00:07:08.620" style="s2">specifically with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:12.310" style="s2">internet and changes in the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.620" end="00:07:14.090" style="s2">the biosphere which are I think altering</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.310" end="00:07:16.310" style="s2">the things we need to consider</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.090" end="00:07:18.770" style="s2">as educators and the things we need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.310" end="00:07:20.750" style="s2">consider in the design of schools are</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.770" end="00:07:22.220" style="s2">very different today and will be even</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.750" end="00:07:24.590" style="s2">more different let&#39;s say ten years from</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.220" end="00:07:28.430" style="s2">now than they were for the past thirty</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.590" end="00:07:30.350" style="s2">years the the rate of change itself is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.430" end="00:07:32.210" style="s2">accelerating as it were and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.350" end="00:07:34.130" style="s2">kind of a space where I hang out you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.210" end="00:07:35.930" style="s2">know my my graduate training was in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.130" end="00:07:38.690" style="s2">educational neuroscience and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.930" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">developmental psychology so I did a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.690" end="00:07:44.210" style="s2">of research kind of in the field in</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.949" style="s2">developmental psychology and some</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.210" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">neuroscience so I&#39;ve got that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.949" end="00:07:50.930" style="s2">background as well but my passion is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:51.860" style="s2">kind of basically philosophy which</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.930" end="00:07:53.660" style="s2">allows me to kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.860" end="00:07:56.630" style="s2">interdisciplinary by nature and right</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.660" end="00:08:00.050" style="s2">that&#39;s why I tend to love talking to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.630" end="00:08:01.070" style="s2">educators because any good educator good</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.050" end="00:08:03.860" style="s2">educator has to think</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.070" end="00:08:06.710" style="s2">interdisciplinarily by by the demand of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.860" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2">the task basically so I find educators</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:11.240" style="s2">actually more open to philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:13.010" style="s2">reflection than specialists and many</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.240" end="00:08:15.410" style="s2">other fields so that&#39;s why I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.010" end="00:08:16.850" style="s2">talk to you today and I&#39;m think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.410" end="00:08:18.620" style="s2">gonna be great conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.850" end="00:08:22.010" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m looking forward to it and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.620" end="00:08:24.919" style="s2">kind of start with maybe a more macro</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.010" end="00:08:27.200" style="s2">approach and one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.919" end="00:08:29.570" style="s2">talk about here or is sort of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.200" end="00:08:31.190" style="s2">mission statement or action a mission</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.570" end="00:08:33.409" style="s2">question because we really believe in</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.190" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">inquiry is revolves around preparing</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.409" end="00:08:38.930" style="s2">students for the what we call the modern</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">world which of course is you know we</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.930" end="00:08:43.480" style="s2">have to really think what what will the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:48.050" style="s2">modern world what does the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.480" end="00:08:50.810" style="s2">demand or what will it and I&#39;m before we</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.050" end="00:08:52.339" style="s2">get too deep I&#39;m wondering if you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.810" end="00:08:55.240" style="s2">any distinction or where you place your</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.339" end="00:08:58.839" style="s2">place yourself on sort of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.240" end="00:09:01.790" style="s2">between or around post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.839" end="00:09:03.950" style="s2">what I guess being called meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.790" end="00:09:06.730" style="s2">and and how you see your work and your</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.950" end="00:09:10.450" style="s2">thinking finding a place in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.730" end="00:09:13.400" style="s2">spectrum right yeah great question I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.450" end="00:09:16.790" style="s2">would definitely identify as a meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.400" end="00:09:20.900" style="s2">modernist and so you know looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.790" end="00:09:23.180" style="s2">evolution of culture you know from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.900" end="00:09:26.780" style="s2">ancient cultures into modern culture and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.180" end="00:09:27.620" style="s2">then from modern culture into postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.780" end="00:09:29.389" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.620" end="00:09:31.670" style="s2">which is the which is mostly where we</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.389" end="00:09:33.889" style="s2">are today there are some who speculated</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.670" end="00:09:35.779" style="s2">and you&#39;re aware of their work who that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.889" end="00:09:37.819" style="s2">there&#39;s a new emergent which is meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.779" end="00:09:40.310" style="s2">modern and now this gets weird just how</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.819" end="00:09:43.430" style="s2">many other prefixes can we put in front</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.310" end="00:09:45.350" style="s2">of modern I&#39;m not super thrilled about</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.430" end="00:09:49.970" style="s2">the term but I think it does signify a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.350" end="00:09:51.829" style="s2">break from the postmodern and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.970" end="00:09:53.720" style="s2">ability to consider the critiques of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.829" end="00:09:56.420" style="s2">post-modernism and the complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.720" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">post-modernism adds and also consider</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.420" end="00:10:00.920" style="s2">what modernity brought us the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:03.949" style="s2">of what the modern revolution brought us</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.920" end="00:10:06.769" style="s2">to consider the benefits of both is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.949" end="00:10:08.509" style="s2">novel possibility so so before you go</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.769" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">further because I&#39;m I want to be sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.509" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">that listeners I don&#39;t want to assume</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:14.749" style="s2">that they understand what postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:16.610" style="s2">means and so how would you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.749" end="00:10:18.319" style="s2">operationalize postmodern and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.610" end="00:10:20.329" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of doing the same with</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.319" end="00:10:22.550" style="s2">matter modern as you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.329" end="00:10:24.829" style="s2">those differences but is there a clean</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.550" end="00:10:28.069" style="s2">clean definition and so we can work with</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.829" end="00:10:30.470" style="s2">that yeah so it&#39;s best and you almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.069" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">have to characterize post-modernism by</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.470" end="00:10:35.750" style="s2">first talking about modernist right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:37.699" style="s2">you know so modernism and there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.750" end="00:10:38.870" style="s2">different ways to define it of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.699" end="00:10:41.300" style="s2">and there&#39;s whole books and whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.870" end="00:10:43.970" style="s2">shelves of books no matter what what</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.300" end="00:10:46.879" style="s2">modernism is but I think a useful way to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.970" end="00:10:48.709" style="s2">think about it is in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.879" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">development of perspective taking and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.709" end="00:10:51.740" style="s2">this is I used this definition because</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:52.990" style="s2">of my training and developmental</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.740" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.990" end="00:11:01.730" style="s2">so what modernism did in many ways was</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:04.550" style="s2">find a way to really powerfully organize</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.730" end="00:11:07.639" style="s2">reality around a single perspective than</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.550" end="00:11:09.589" style="s2">a single abstract perspective so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.639" end="00:11:12.709" style="s2">know one of the characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.589" end="00:11:14.569" style="s2">modernism which along with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.709" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">Scientific Revolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.569" end="00:11:19.069" style="s2">revolutions of industrial technologies</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:21.199" style="s2">that led to global capitalism you had</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.069" end="00:11:23.629" style="s2">the ability to start to centralize and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.199" end="00:11:26.990" style="s2">to record keep and to make things</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.629" end="00:11:30.199" style="s2">objective and make them make sense in</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.990" end="00:11:31.730" style="s2">unprecedented ways and all that sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.199" end="00:11:34.970" style="s2">making was done basically through a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.730" end="00:11:38.509" style="s2">single lens and this is sometimes called</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.970" end="00:11:39.740" style="s2">the you know the grand narrative right</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.509" end="00:11:41.840" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.740" end="00:11:44.210" style="s2">say there may be other views of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.840" end="00:11:47.090" style="s2">happening when a colonialist empire goes</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.210" end="00:11:50.290" style="s2">into africa and destroys all the small</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.090" end="00:11:54.860" style="s2">local farms and builds a single large</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.290" end="00:11:59.390" style="s2">agricultural venture with perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.860" end="00:12:01.700" style="s2">geometrically symmetrical rows and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.390" end="00:12:03.890" style="s2">know where you can actually predict crop</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.700" end="00:12:06.050" style="s2">yields from thousands away thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.890" end="00:12:08.500" style="s2">miles away you know based on so so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.050" end="00:12:11.450" style="s2">they step in and remove the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.500" end="00:12:13.670" style="s2">disorganization and organic nests of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.450" end="00:12:18.830" style="s2">traditions and replace them with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.670" end="00:12:23.540" style="s2">kind of singular kind of geometrically</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.830" end="00:12:24.860" style="s2">perfect modern form you know they view</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.540" end="00:12:26.500" style="s2">it from the single perspective this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.860" end="00:12:29.330" style="s2">the advance right</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.500" end="00:12:30.980" style="s2">what post-modernism does post monitors</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.330" end="00:12:33.560" style="s2">and comes in and says well what about</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.980" end="00:12:37.070" style="s2">the displace two people right they</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.560" end="00:12:38.300" style="s2">clearly didn&#39;t have your modern view and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.070" end="00:12:41.210" style="s2">they had a very different view of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.300" end="00:12:43.910" style="s2">happened to them visa vie the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.210" end="00:12:46.580" style="s2">colonial impingement upon their original</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.910" end="00:12:48.680" style="s2">tradition no farming practices let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.580" end="00:12:51.260" style="s2">you&#39;ve met or educational or educational</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.680" end="00:12:54.500" style="s2">practices so what post-modernism does is</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.260" end="00:12:56.180" style="s2">it says listen modernity there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.500" end="00:12:58.520" style="s2">than one perspective there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.180" end="00:13:00.290" style="s2">innumerable perspectives on what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.520" end="00:13:02.690" style="s2">on it numerable literally like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.290" end="00:13:06.230" style="s2">so many we can&#39;t get a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.690" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">catalogue of the perspectives and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.230" end="00:13:12.920" style="s2">whereas modernity had a pathology of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.920" end="00:13:18.470" style="s2">has the pathology of the a perspectival</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.120" end="00:13:48.950" style="s2">because your yields are actually not</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.430" end="00:13:50.750" style="s2">higher than the traditional practices by</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.940" end="00:14:00.010" style="s2">traditional cultures etc and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.610" end="00:14:01.930" style="s2">very basic conflict between how do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.010" end="00:14:04.420" style="s2">view the world do a view it from a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.930" end="00:14:08.080" style="s2">singular perspective or do you view it</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.420" end="00:14:09.910" style="s2">from a multiplicity of perspectives so</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.080" end="00:14:10.980" style="s2">there has to be something after</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.910" end="00:14:14.020" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.980" end="00:14:15.700" style="s2">that&#39;s culture evolves evolution go at</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.020" end="00:14:18.520" style="s2">those places and evolution often works</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.700" end="00:14:20.200" style="s2">by taking something singular breaking it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.520" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">into multiple pieces and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.200" end="00:14:24.970" style="s2">reintegrating is a higher level some</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:27.310" style="s2">kind of new organic unity and this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.970" end="00:14:29.860" style="s2">what a meta modern view attempts to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.310" end="00:14:32.110" style="s2">or a my favorite meta modern view which</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.860" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">is integral theory or another one like</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.110" end="00:14:36.730" style="s2">rooibos cars critical realism what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:38.040" style="s2">do is they say okay we&#39;re gonna let the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.730" end="00:14:40.090" style="s2">perspectives of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.040" end="00:14:42.730" style="s2">proliferate there&#39;s many many many</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.090" end="00:14:45.970" style="s2">perspectives on that Colonial farming</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.730" end="00:14:49.450" style="s2">venture right each one has a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.970" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">truth and yet we can organize them right</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.450" end="00:14:53.620" style="s2">and yet we can make judicious decisions</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.960" style="s2">about which views are most reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.620" end="00:14:57.940" style="s2">and eventually get a kind of catalogue</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.960" end="00:14:59.620" style="s2">of the viability of different views and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.940" end="00:15:02.500" style="s2">so one of the things that characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:05.110" style="s2">the move beyond post-modernism is there</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.500" end="00:15:07.210" style="s2">really are key and the evaluative</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.110" end="00:15:10.000" style="s2">distinction and a reemergence of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.210" end="00:15:12.820" style="s2">objectivity but not the simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.000" end="00:15:14.170" style="s2">modern objectivity an objectivity that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.820" end="00:15:17.980" style="s2">has to do with the refraction of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.170" end="00:15:19.480" style="s2">different perspectives and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.980" end="00:15:22.930" style="s2">many different kind of currents of meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.480" end="00:15:26.200" style="s2">modernism I tend to like the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.930" end="00:15:30.660" style="s2">are that are more strongly theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.200" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">and but there are others that are simply</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.660" end="00:15:35.110" style="s2">aesthetic which is to say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:37.660" style="s2">large artistic movement that is meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.110" end="00:15:39.760" style="s2">modern and then there are meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.660" end="00:15:41.590" style="s2">cultural styles which are seeing with</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.760" end="00:15:46.360" style="s2">the kind of new eclecticism of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.590" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">positive global multiculturalism which</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.360" end="00:15:51.280" style="s2">is different from the postmodern view of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:54.430" style="s2">always in conflict always competing for</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.280" end="00:15:56.530" style="s2">power oh right there is a view where you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.430" end="00:15:58.750" style="s2">can see actually a set new synthesis a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.530" end="00:16:00.640" style="s2">global Renaissance that&#39;s more than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.750" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">a modern view there&#39;s got to be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.640" end="00:16:05.980" style="s2">reuniting of the fracturing and not not</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">going backwards to murder</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.980" end="00:16:10.150" style="s2">in a single narrative but a weaving</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:13.000" style="s2">together of multi narratives into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.150" end="00:16:18.970" style="s2">single narrative so how does that play</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.000" end="00:16:20.680" style="s2">into or juxtapose with sort of I know</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.970" end="00:16:24.040" style="s2">you like you said you&#39;ve done quite a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.680" end="00:16:25.960" style="s2">bit of work on social justice and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.040" end="00:16:29.860" style="s2">mentioned the hierarchical structures</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.960" end="00:16:31.420" style="s2">and the the postmodern connection with</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.860" end="00:16:33.940" style="s2">sort of identity politics and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.420" end="00:16:36.940" style="s2">fracturing but then bringing that back</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.940" end="00:16:41.020" style="s2">together so what how does that social</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.940" end="00:16:44.080" style="s2">justice picture advance from postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.020" end="00:16:46.330" style="s2">to meta modern yeah no I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.080" end="00:16:49.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a very good question you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.330" end="00:16:52.240" style="s2">term social justice is that actually a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.150" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">difficult one to use these days right</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.240" end="00:16:56.440" style="s2">you know the terms the terms become</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:17:00.820" style="s2">politicized right that&#39;s some of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.440" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">response which is to say you know meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.820" end="00:17:04.930" style="s2">modern moves whether they&#39;re political</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">or aesthetic and the same can be said of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.930" end="00:17:11.770" style="s2">integral moves these are moves that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:15.339" style="s2">always seeking to foster synthesis and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.770" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">integration and master multiple</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.339" end="00:17:22.150" style="s2">perspectives and so some of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:24.430" style="s2">seeing from the social so called social</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.150" end="00:17:26.920" style="s2">justice can are actually moves that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.430" end="00:17:30.760" style="s2">not that they are moves to scapegoat and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.920" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">moves to deepen infraction and actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.760" end="00:17:37.030" style="s2">to dismiss the possibility of mutual</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:40.030" style="s2">understanding right so the meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.030" end="00:17:44.950" style="s2">seeks to understand even the degraded</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.030" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">and guilty why why aren&#39;t they why</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.950" end="00:17:51.700" style="s2">aren&#39;t it this way not finger wagging</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:54.610" style="s2">and burn him at the stake so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.700" end="00:17:55.090" style="s2">something about the move to restorative</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.610" end="00:17:58.330" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.090" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">that&#39;s meta modern and to many so-called</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.330" end="00:18:03.550" style="s2">social justice Crusaders or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:05.410" style="s2">want to call it I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.550" end="00:18:06.610" style="s2">travesty that the term social justice is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.410" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">being dragged through the mud but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.610" end="00:18:10.180" style="s2">another story</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.110" end="00:18:14.740" style="s2">the point I want to make is that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.180" end="00:18:17.410" style="s2">tactics and ideology of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.740" end="00:18:18.970" style="s2">protest cultures are so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.410" end="00:18:21.159" style="s2">conflictual and antithetical</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.970" end="00:18:24.039" style="s2">reaching out mean mutual understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.159" end="00:18:27.460" style="s2">that they become unjust themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.039" end="00:18:30.250" style="s2">this is a tragic irony and so that what</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.460" end="00:18:33.549" style="s2">that means is that the real work for</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.250" end="00:18:35.080" style="s2">social justice is hindered because now</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.549" end="00:18:36.669" style="s2">social justice is a bad word and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.080" end="00:18:38.140" style="s2">rightfully so in the mouths of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.669" end="00:18:39.730" style="s2">intellectual darkweb when their</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.140" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">castigating some of this behavior that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.730" end="00:18:44.980" style="s2">taking place on campuses and so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:47.110" style="s2">makes my conversation that&#39;s someone who</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.980" end="00:18:50.289" style="s2">thinks about social justice actually in</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.110" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">a very clear way having worked on Rawls</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.289" end="00:18:55.690" style="s2">for my dissertation and read deeply with</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:56.770" style="s2">Martha Nussbaum you know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.690" end="00:18:59.260" style="s2">way of thinking about social justice</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.770" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s always reconciliatory and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.260" end="00:19:04.450" style="s2">always is predicated upon deepening</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:07.390" style="s2">mutual understanding between parties as</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.450" end="00:19:12.010" style="s2">opposed to deepening misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.390" end="00:19:13.900" style="s2">and animosity and yeah yeah so the and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.010" end="00:19:16.539" style="s2">you talk about that intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.900" end="00:19:18.340" style="s2">web which is folks are not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.539" end="00:19:20.470" style="s2">familiar with that probably are perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.340" end="00:19:24.789" style="s2">more so with the New York Times article</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.470" end="00:19:26.890" style="s2">and sort of the the push by the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.789" end="00:19:30.130" style="s2">mainstream media so Sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.890" end="00:19:33.190" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and and Ben Shapiro and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.130" end="00:19:34.539" style="s2">Weinstein all of those folks in and as</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.190" end="00:19:37.720" style="s2">you mentioned sort of the things going</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.539" end="00:19:40.690" style="s2">on on campus about free speech and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.720" end="00:19:43.690" style="s2">that position that unfortunately some</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.690" end="00:19:46.120" style="s2">some are placing themselves in what</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.690" end="00:19:48.610" style="s2">you&#39;re different than me then because</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.120" end="00:19:50.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t understand me we can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.610" end="00:19:51.850" style="s2">you can&#39;t you because you&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.679" end="00:19:56.620" style="s2">you can&#39;t understand me</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.850" end="00:19:58.870" style="s2">which then for me in my mind is a place</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.620" end="00:20:01.000" style="s2">where now we how do we bridge that gap</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.870" end="00:20:04.840" style="s2">as you&#39;re sort of talking about that how</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.000" end="00:20:08.919" style="s2">do I understand who you are and use that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:11.740" style="s2">as that difference but then then find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.919" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">place where we can come together and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.740" end="00:20:16.059" style="s2">know that it that&#39;s a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">piece I think going forward as we think</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.059" end="00:20:23.220" style="s2">about equity and you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:28.270" style="s2">work that you&#39;ve done around IQ and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:30.970" style="s2">we have charles murray in his book that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.270" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">talks about IQ and the associations with</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.970" end="00:20:34.390" style="s2">race and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:37.659" style="s2">how reductivist that is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.390" end="00:20:40.169" style="s2">really so much more and I mean I&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.659" end="00:20:42.610" style="s2">over the place with this sort of ran but</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.169" end="00:20:44.980" style="s2">but it makes sense it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.610" end="00:20:47.799" style="s2">free-associate to the IQ and yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.980" end="00:20:49.750" style="s2">because the IQ is actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.799" end="00:20:52.269" style="s2">perfect examples of an instantiation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.750" end="00:20:54.130" style="s2">the modern perspective right because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.269" end="00:20:57.480" style="s2">IQ says that in mind is this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.130" end="00:20:59.559" style="s2">can be understood in a single number and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.480" end="00:21:02.110" style="s2">the result of that number is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.559" end="00:21:03.279" style="s2">simplistic hierarchy of capacities all</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.110" end="00:21:04.840" style="s2">right so you know there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.279" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">critique of the IQ which I brought them</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.840" end="00:21:07.899" style="s2">through in my book and you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:10.570" style="s2">rehearse it here if you want but I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.899" end="00:21:12.490" style="s2">that the issue has to do with you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.570" end="00:21:14.769" style="s2">the the reason we&#39;re seeing what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.490" end="00:21:16.510" style="s2">seeing in the public culture has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.769" end="00:21:20.380" style="s2">to do with the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.510" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">educational system and this really messy</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.380" end="00:21:23.950" style="s2">transition in educational institutions</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:25.539" style="s2">between the modern perspective and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.950" end="00:21:28.899" style="s2">postmodern perspective and even the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.539" end="00:21:31.240" style="s2">emerging metamodel because for a long</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.899" end="00:21:33.279" style="s2">time and in fact most of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.240" end="00:21:36.429" style="s2">are in power now which is to say the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.279" end="00:21:40.419" style="s2">baby boomers these people were educated</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.429" end="00:21:43.059" style="s2">in modern educational institutions with</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.419" end="00:21:45.899" style="s2">desks and rows I mean my mom was slapped</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.059" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">on the hand with a ruler by a nun yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.899" end="00:21:51.789" style="s2">that may happen in some places now but</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:55.539" style="s2">you be sued right though things have</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.789" end="00:21:57.820" style="s2">changed and you had many institutions</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.539" end="00:22:00.010" style="s2">and the ones that I attended are</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.820" end="00:22:02.230" style="s2">included were this strange amalgam um of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.010" end="00:22:03.639" style="s2">the modern and the postmodern where</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.230" end="00:22:06.039" style="s2">there were still the strict</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.639" end="00:22:08.289" style="s2">authoritarian structure in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.039" end="00:22:10.299" style="s2">and yet intellectually there was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.289" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">questioning and a critique you know and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.299" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">a multicultural emphasis and so some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:16.539" style="s2">what we&#39;re actually seeing play on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.559" end="00:22:18.669" style="s2">public culture is the failure of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.539" end="00:22:21.639" style="s2">broader educational institutions to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.669" end="00:22:25.269" style="s2">navigate through the post the modern to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.639" end="00:22:27.130" style="s2">postmodern shift and and into the Menem</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.269" end="00:22:28.919" style="s2">honor which is what I write about in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.130" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">book that&#39;s coming out later this summer</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.919" end="00:22:33.429" style="s2">which is what would a meta modern school</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:35.830" style="s2">or an integral school system look like</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.429" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">beyond both the modern and the most fun</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.830" end="00:22:41.169" style="s2">and so the trick with postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:43.240" style="s2">education is that as soon as you go into</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.169" end="00:22:43.700" style="s2">the a perspectival where there&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.240" end="00:22:45.769" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.700" end="00:22:48.230" style="s2">perspective of every perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.769" end="00:22:52.149" style="s2">equally correct come very hard to teach</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.230" end="00:22:55.519" style="s2">and actually very hard to learn because</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.149" end="00:22:58.460" style="s2">you know teach really Authority depends</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.519" end="00:22:59.809" style="s2">upon some type of it at least minimal</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.460" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">hierarchy of competence and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.809" end="00:23:04.130" style="s2">understanding and that relies on some</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">minimum relationship to a world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.130" end="00:23:09.409" style="s2">real that both the student and teacher</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:11.059" style="s2">stand in relationship to so as I know</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.409" end="00:23:12.380" style="s2">you take that away and then all sudden</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.059" end="00:23:15.460" style="s2">you have a crisis of teacher really</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.380" end="00:23:17.960" style="s2">Authority at all levels of schooling and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.460" end="00:23:20.210" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting situation and a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.960" end="00:23:24.200" style="s2">very big problem that is interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.210" end="00:23:27.529" style="s2">one of the the disagreements that I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.200" end="00:23:29.090" style="s2">had with a guy named Gary Hutchins who</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.529" end="00:23:30.830" style="s2">has been on my podcast before he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.090" end="00:23:34.309" style="s2">Western Kentucky University professor</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.830" end="00:23:36.409" style="s2">he&#39;s really big into school choice and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.309" end="00:23:38.539" style="s2">has even gone so far as to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.409" end="00:23:40.970" style="s2">competition you know drives excellence</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.539" end="00:23:44.899" style="s2">those kinds of things which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.970" end="00:23:48.830" style="s2">not and i looking at your work i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.899" end="00:23:51.350" style="s2">you would hold that in and as a value as</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.830" end="00:23:54.139" style="s2">well that education in the education</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.350" end="00:23:55.789" style="s2">realm competition is not what were is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.139" end="00:24:01.510" style="s2">not going to produce the results that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.789" end="00:24:06.049" style="s2">were after but his his mindset is around</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.510" end="00:24:09.529" style="s2">giving parents ultimately choice so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.049" end="00:24:12.620" style="s2">they can choose an education for their</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.529" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">child which sounds great and my question</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.620" end="00:24:17.960" style="s2">is how do we make sure that teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:20.419" style="s2">learning is of high quality and those</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.960" end="00:24:23.809" style="s2">choices aren&#39;t driven by superficial</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.419" end="00:24:25.480" style="s2">things like test scores or even IQ</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.809" end="00:24:29.539" style="s2">scores or you know just those simple</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.480" end="00:24:31.700" style="s2">reductivist things and you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.539" end="00:24:33.710" style="s2">we keep that quality that lens of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.700" end="00:24:37.070" style="s2">quality teaching and learning as the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.710" end="00:24:39.860" style="s2">main driver and his pushback is is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.070" end="00:24:43.970" style="s2">he felt like that&#39;s paternalistic so it</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.860" end="00:24:46.519" style="s2">it&#39;s in conflict to what he&#39;s pushing as</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.970" end="00:24:49.159" style="s2">sort of school choice saying that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.519" end="00:24:50.809" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be is sort of the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.159" end="00:24:53.629" style="s2">the term you used the teacher lee</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.809" end="00:24:57.080" style="s2">authority or teacher lee authority yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.629" end="00:25:00.650" style="s2">which is I&#39;m thinking is Sonam</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.080" end="00:25:02.420" style="s2">- paternalistic right I mean well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.650" end="00:25:06.740" style="s2">interesting so that&#39;s an act when I</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:08.750" style="s2">write about teacherly Authority in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.740" end="00:25:10.430" style="s2">book that&#39;s coming out I use exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.750" end="00:25:13.400" style="s2">that phrase paternalistic and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.430" end="00:25:14.680" style="s2">paternalism this is again an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.400" end="00:25:17.660" style="s2">place with a modern and the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.680" end="00:25:19.310" style="s2">come into conflict and where the meta</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.660" end="00:25:23.680" style="s2">modern transcends and includes the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.310" end="00:25:25.610" style="s2">conflict like so the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.680" end="00:25:27.800" style="s2">paternalism and something being</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.610" end="00:25:30.110" style="s2">paternalistic is pejorative in the mouth</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.800" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">of someone who is postmodern right</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.110" end="00:25:35.990" style="s2">there&#39;s they&#39;re saying essentially how</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:39.260" style="s2">dare you put your norms upon me your</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.990" end="00:25:40.730" style="s2">rules and regulations if Heath</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.260" end="00:25:42.350" style="s2">perspectives correct then you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.730" end="00:25:48.230" style="s2">impose your perspective on another</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.350" end="00:25:50.990" style="s2">perspective the modern and of course I</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.230" end="00:25:52.850" style="s2">think of dr. Spock and I just met many</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.990" end="00:25:54.800" style="s2">people prescribe parenting techniques</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.850" end="00:25:56.360" style="s2">for them but the Myers says actually no</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.800" end="00:25:59.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a developmental thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.360" end="00:26:04.520" style="s2">going on here and we need to in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.690" end="00:26:05.960" style="s2">very strictly regulate and you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.520" end="00:26:07.370" style="s2">of lay out a geometrical grid of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.960" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">progression for the child to go through</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.370" end="00:26:11.690" style="s2">stepwise perfectly and that&#39;s the modern</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:13.220" style="s2">view where they at this age you should</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.690" end="00:26:14.090" style="s2">be this height at that age you should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.220" end="00:26:17.270" style="s2">that light if you&#39;re not that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.090" end="00:26:20.990" style="s2">something&#39;s pathological don&#39;t mind that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.270" end="00:26:23.480" style="s2">growth is not linear so so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.990" end="00:26:25.550" style="s2">it that&#39;s a conflict and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.480" end="00:26:28.160" style="s2">is that right now there is a crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.550" end="00:26:29.870" style="s2">yeah parental and teach really Authority</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.160" end="00:26:33.860" style="s2">to be quite ominous which are very</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.870" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">similar um so but there are obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.860" end="00:26:38.780" style="s2">all admire parents and parenting and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something about a good parent</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.780" end="00:26:45.110" style="s2">and the appropriate exercise of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:48.500" style="s2">paternalistic instincts that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.110" end="00:26:50.840" style="s2">the gifts of nature to the human and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.500" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">what I feel is that yes paternalistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.840" end="00:26:54.530" style="s2">there are bad forms of modern</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:56.560" style="s2">paternalism which is the classic white</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.530" end="00:26:57.860" style="s2">man&#39;s burden we have to go to Africa and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.560" end="00:27:00.170" style="s2">colonize</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.860" end="00:27:01.640" style="s2">it&#39;s our Christian duty to civilize the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.170" end="00:27:05.300" style="s2">savages that&#39;s a great example of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.640" end="00:27:08.810" style="s2">paternalistic modern attitude but any</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.300" end="00:27:10.520" style="s2">parent knows that you can&#39;t just lay out</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.810" end="00:27:12.020" style="s2">all the utensils on the take</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.520" end="00:27:15.080" style="s2">and let the kid pick cuz he could pick</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.020" end="00:27:16.970" style="s2">the steak knife right you you want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.080" end="00:27:19.460" style="s2">lay out just the actual options that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.970" end="00:27:21.860" style="s2">safe given the developmental stage and</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.510" end="00:27:28.190" style="s2">teach really Authority it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.630" end="00:27:30.020" style="s2">see in a situation like that with</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.190" end="00:27:32.300" style="s2">concrete operations or sensory motor</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.110" end="00:27:41.960" style="s2">around the fire is that paternalistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.230" end="00:27:44.840" style="s2">you like it now yeah that&#39;s the instinct</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.960" end="00:27:46.940" style="s2">to to foster the life of a child and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.840" end="00:27:49.850" style="s2">similarly appropriate teach really</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.940" end="00:27:53.470" style="s2">Authority is done with the child or</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.850" end="00:27:56.210" style="s2">learner let&#39;s say more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.470" end="00:27:59.660" style="s2">inappropriate is done to the child or</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.210" end="00:28:02.950" style="s2">learner right and then sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.660" end="00:28:05.780" style="s2">have to do it in such a way that you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.950" end="00:28:07.550" style="s2">in a sense imagining their future</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.780" end="00:28:09.380" style="s2">agreement with you so these are three</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.550" end="00:28:11.690" style="s2">different styles so the negative</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.380" end="00:28:13.790" style="s2">paternalism is done to the child right</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.690" end="00:28:15.170" style="s2">this is not who could care what the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.790" end="00:28:21.140" style="s2">child thinks or what the child&#39;s goals</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.170" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">are learn this right the the next step</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.140" end="00:28:27.740" style="s2">is well listen kid if you knew it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:30.740" style="s2">good for you you know / you&#39;ll thank me</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.740" end="00:28:33.140" style="s2">later is the healthy paternalism of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.740" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">child who&#39;s not quite cooperative you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.140" end="00:28:36.679" style="s2">know which is to say that you do a</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.480" end="00:28:41.960" style="s2">taking to account the kids uniqueness is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.400" end="00:28:43.100" style="s2">future trajectory all these things you</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.960" end="00:28:44.179" style="s2">know about him and the intimate</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.110" end="00:28:48.200" style="s2">on us</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:50.690" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna push you just a little the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.200" end="00:28:53.870" style="s2">best teach really Authority is when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.690" end="00:28:55.309" style="s2">a it&#39;s a journey together in learning or</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.870" end="00:28:58.280" style="s2">you&#39;re both sharing the same learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.309" end="00:28:59.720" style="s2">goal right there it&#39;s different to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.280" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">kids says listen I want to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.720" end="00:29:05.330" style="s2">read I know you know how to read teach</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:06.350" style="s2">me to read different from saying list</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.330" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna have to sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.350" end="00:29:11.450" style="s2">struggle to read and also different from</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:14.780" style="s2">you know read every day 15 minutes this</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.450" end="00:29:16.130" style="s2">time or you dead so so I just think</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.780" end="00:29:18.050" style="s2">there&#39;s through these different forms</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.130" end="00:29:20.870" style="s2">and it&#39;s too easy to mix all of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.050" end="00:29:23.480" style="s2">together and just dismiss parental and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.870" end="00:29:26.300" style="s2">teach really Authority entirely</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.480" end="00:29:28.370" style="s2">when in fact that&#39;s a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.300" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">thing to do and parents of teachers know</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.370" end="00:29:31.550" style="s2">that and no one really does that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:34.490" style="s2">just this confusion in the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.550" end="00:29:36.620" style="s2">modern conflict which makes many of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.490" end="00:29:39.080" style="s2">post modernists overstate their claims</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.620" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">essentially when what they could do is</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.080" end="00:29:42.380" style="s2">move to the meta modern and say listen</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a moment of truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.380" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">modern need to take the stick night up</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:49.310" style="s2">off the table and to measure kids in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:50.690" style="s2">basic way to make sure which ones have</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.310" end="00:29:52.340" style="s2">such unique learning needs to need</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.690" end="00:29:54.290" style="s2">special attention like my case with my</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.340" end="00:29:57.020" style="s2">dyslexia right that was a modernity that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.290" end="00:29:59.300" style="s2">allowed me to be identified and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.020" end="00:30:02.360" style="s2">sorted into a different category right</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.300" end="00:30:04.850" style="s2">so it so is the I guess I&#39;m hearing then</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.360" end="00:30:07.250" style="s2">there&#39;s the parallels from modern to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.850" end="00:30:09.830" style="s2">postmodern to meta modern that might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.250" end="00:30:14.420" style="s2">with a much more traditional industrial</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.830" end="00:30:16.550" style="s2">schooling prescriptive model - or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.420" end="00:30:18.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not the parallel but the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.550" end="00:30:21.490" style="s2">pushback that sometimes we get when we</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.950" end="00:30:23.780" style="s2">talk of talk with teachers about</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.490" end="00:30:26.810" style="s2">teaching and learning from an inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.780" end="00:30:28.760" style="s2">inquiry perspective which is a pull-pull</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.810" end="00:30:32.780" style="s2">dynamic as of course opposed to the push</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.760" end="00:30:35.150" style="s2">so kind of as you said we have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.780" end="00:30:37.820" style="s2">challenge a driving question and a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.150" end="00:30:42.200" style="s2">problem in which from which all our</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.820" end="00:30:45.170" style="s2">questions should be stemming and ideally</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.200" end="00:30:49.190" style="s2">and this is hard hard to do so I use</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.170" end="00:30:52.010" style="s2">that term ideally with with all do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.190" end="00:30:54.860" style="s2">know process there is that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.010" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">trying to do is get students to voice</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.860" end="00:30:59.030" style="s2">those content pieces as need to knows in</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:00.740" style="s2">order tain so that and that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.030" end="00:31:03.770" style="s2">challenge and that driving question so</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.740" end="00:31:07.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not because what we don&#39;t want is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.770" end="00:31:09.950" style="s2">is if I if I come in and ask a student</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.130" end="00:31:11.990" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing and then why we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.950" end="00:31:13.640" style="s2">want them the answer to be well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.990" end="00:31:15.410" style="s2">doing this for a grade or because this</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.640" end="00:31:17.210" style="s2">teacher told me to or kind of as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.410" end="00:31:18.890" style="s2">said I&#39;m gonna need this in the future</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.210" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">which is really doesn&#39;t resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.890" end="00:31:23.780" style="s2">many kids but we want them to do is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:26.870" style="s2">ideally say I&#39;m doing this because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.780" end="00:31:29.180" style="s2">trying to answer that driving question</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.870" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to to solve for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.180" end="00:31:33.980" style="s2">problem that challenge and and in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.260" style="s2">best of scenarios those are authentic</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.980" end="00:31:38.660" style="s2">and meaningful and real not</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.260" end="00:31:41.180" style="s2">tribe from content but you know again</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.660" end="00:31:42.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a spectrum there so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.180" end="00:31:46.520" style="s2">push backs we get when we work with</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.920" end="00:31:48.950" style="s2">teachers and schools and in folks that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.520" end="00:31:51.620" style="s2">think are much more modern in their from</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.950" end="00:31:53.990" style="s2">their perspective is that well they</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.620" end="00:31:55.700" style="s2">can&#39;t I mean if we start the tops of top</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.990" end="00:31:57.770" style="s2">of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy and ask them to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.700" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">create something without first teaching</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.770" end="00:32:02.360" style="s2">what they need to know and remember the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:04.010" style="s2">bottom of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.360" end="00:32:05.630" style="s2">think about nothing well of course they</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.010" end="00:32:07.460" style="s2">can&#39;t think about nothing that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.630" end="00:32:11.300" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying so it&#39;s it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.460" end="00:32:15.010" style="s2">reductive approach to that that push</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.300" end="00:32:17.390" style="s2">back and as one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.010" end="00:32:19.580" style="s2">sort of a quote I think it was a exact</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.390" end="00:32:21.650" style="s2">quote here from from one of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.580" end="00:32:23.270" style="s2">writings is talking about most</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.650" end="00:32:24.500" style="s2">open-source content platforms and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.270" end="00:32:27.380" style="s2">think you&#39;re also talking about ed tech</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.500" end="00:32:29.740" style="s2">but cede all authority to the user and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.380" end="00:32:32.650" style="s2">I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.740" end="00:32:35.270" style="s2">utensils on the on the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.650" end="00:32:37.450" style="s2">analogy here and talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.270" end="00:32:39.680" style="s2">classic mistake of progressive and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.450" end="00:32:41.000" style="s2">constructivist pedagogy so is that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.680" end="00:32:43.310" style="s2">that what you&#39;re talking about there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.000" end="00:32:46.310" style="s2">it were were that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.310" end="00:32:48.650" style="s2">constructivists who are basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.310" end="00:32:51.860" style="s2">just put all the knives and everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.650" end="00:32:53.330" style="s2">out on the table yeah no I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.860" end="00:32:54.860" style="s2">never actually seen someone say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.330" end="00:32:56.660" style="s2">again one of the problems with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.860" end="00:32:58.370" style="s2">public cultures that were we build</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.660" end="00:33:00.830" style="s2">characters of one another and straw men</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.370" end="00:33:04.790" style="s2">but but yes taken to an extreme and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.830" end="00:33:07.940" style="s2">see this occasionally like and let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.790" end="00:33:11.150" style="s2">back to John Dewey cuz he&#39;s he had this</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.940" end="00:33:13.310" style="s2">problem he wasn&#39;t trying to initiate</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.150" end="00:33:15.380" style="s2">what you&#39;re describing like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.310" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">get the emotional goals of the child</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.380" end="00:33:21.860" style="s2">aligned with the emotional goals of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:24.710" style="s2">teacher and and the curriculum and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.860" end="00:33:28.160" style="s2">get back to emotion in a second you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.710" end="00:33:30.140" style="s2">but yes the the classic mistake of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.160" end="00:33:33.020" style="s2">progressive constructivist educator is</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.140" end="00:33:36.500" style="s2">giving too much freedom and what Dewey</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.020" end="00:33:38.990" style="s2">said essentially was you know that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.500" end="00:33:42.620" style="s2">freedom is best which enables more</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.990" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">future freedoms right now there are some</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.620" end="00:33:46.340" style="s2">forms of freedom that actually if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">allow for them now you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.340" end="00:33:48.979" style="s2">cutting off the possibility of future</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:52.440" style="s2">freedoms</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.979" end="00:33:53.789" style="s2">and so this is you know the Dewey school</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.440" end="00:33:57.359" style="s2">classically a University of Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.789" end="00:34:01.019" style="s2">laboratory school once do we relinquish</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.359" end="00:34:02.539" style="s2">control became a place where a child if</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.019" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">he didn&#39;t want to learn the alphabet</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.539" end="00:34:07.109" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have to learn the alphabet or</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:09.869" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t want to multiply wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.109" end="00:34:11.339" style="s2">have to multiply right and so they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.869" end="00:34:14.700" style="s2">giving the child the choice to do other</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.339" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">things but at the same time that&#39;s a key</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.700" end="00:34:21.539" style="s2">freedom that is actually made like</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">you&#39;re cutting off the future freedom by</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.539" end="00:34:27.990" style="s2">not giving them constraint now right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:30.059" style="s2">you can think of like you know we want</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.990" end="00:34:33.059" style="s2">to constrain freedom only in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.059" end="00:34:34.859" style="s2">interest of more future freedom right if</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.059" end="00:34:36.450" style="s2">you&#39;re like this is this abstract as you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.859" end="00:34:39.539" style="s2">can get thinking about because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.450" end="00:34:41.940" style="s2">basic issue again in this dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.539" end="00:34:45.179" style="s2">teacherly Authority how does that work</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.940" end="00:34:48.030" style="s2">and when are you rightfully able to tell</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.179" end="00:34:49.619" style="s2">someone to kind of do something or think</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.030" end="00:34:51.450" style="s2">some way and how do you get to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.619" end="00:34:53.339" style="s2">participate with someone such that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.450" end="00:34:54.629" style="s2">ask you to correct their thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.339" end="00:34:56.940" style="s2">this is the other thing we talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.629" end="00:34:59.099" style="s2">about the mindset of the teacher but</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.940" end="00:35:02.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a mindset of the student right</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.099" end="00:35:05.400" style="s2">there&#39;s the learner mindset and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.760" end="00:35:07.980" style="s2">learner mindset flix with the consumer</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.400" end="00:35:09.869" style="s2">mindset it&#39;s just worth mentioning the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.980" end="00:35:12.690" style="s2">consumer is always right the customer is</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.869" end="00:35:14.760" style="s2">always right whereas the student</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.690" end="00:35:16.859" style="s2">actually wants to be proven wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.760" end="00:35:18.690" style="s2">the true student goes to the teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.859" end="00:35:22.710" style="s2">says please you know correct the way I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.690" end="00:35:24.210" style="s2">think help me now help me learn and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.710" end="00:35:26.339" style="s2">there&#39;s something about cultivating the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.210" end="00:35:28.650" style="s2">virtues of learning and being a student</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.339" end="00:35:30.630" style="s2">that needs to be discussed as well and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.650" end="00:35:32.849" style="s2">again some of the cultural things you</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.630" end="00:35:36.539" style="s2">know move against that so yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.849" end="00:35:38.460" style="s2">sense of you want to promote freedom but</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.539" end="00:35:40.559" style="s2">not so much freedom that you inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.460" end="00:35:43.380" style="s2">future freedom and then you want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.559" end="00:35:45.329" style="s2">constrain freedom as as little as</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.380" end="00:35:47.549" style="s2">possible right you want to put as few</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.329" end="00:35:49.770" style="s2">strengths as possible and those that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.549" end="00:35:52.589" style="s2">do put in place are put in place in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.770" end="00:35:54.750" style="s2">interest of again future freedom future</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.589" end="00:35:56.750" style="s2">ability to learn that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.750" end="00:35:59.460" style="s2">Dewey and way to characterize that and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.750" end="00:36:01.559" style="s2">you know he was me he worked very hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.460" end="00:36:02.460" style="s2">to try to get progressive educators to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.559" end="00:36:05.730" style="s2">see that he saw</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.460" end="00:36:07.980" style="s2">a lot of the free schools and really the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.730" end="00:36:10.830" style="s2">interesting and artists and innovations</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.980" end="00:36:13.560" style="s2">and education that we&#39;re going on at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.830" end="00:36:15.150" style="s2">time that he was most active and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.560" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">were again putting all the knives on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.150" end="00:36:20.010" style="s2">table and you know but this was also a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">time when children had been in mines and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.010" end="00:36:23.130" style="s2">been used as farm laborers and were</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">actually could probably wield a knife</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.130" end="00:36:26.580" style="s2">pretty well all right so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:28.410" style="s2">that&#39;s another conversation about you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.580" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">know the degrees of freedom change as</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.410" end="00:36:33.060" style="s2">technology is changing culture change</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:36.599" style="s2">and so right now the equivalent is more</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.060" end="00:36:38.820" style="s2">like YouTube in the hands of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.599" end="00:36:41.670" style="s2">like totally open at YouTube in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.820" end="00:36:42.750" style="s2">hands of a child is the equivalent if</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.670" end="00:36:45.000" style="s2">there&#39;s knives on there they can hurt</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.750" end="00:36:47.490" style="s2">themselves and get traumatized just from</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.000" end="00:36:50.430" style="s2">watching YouTube and randomly navigating</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.490" end="00:36:51.810" style="s2">through it and so again who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.430" end="00:36:55.820" style="s2">responsible for that is it the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.810" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">technology companies or the parents and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.820" end="00:36:59.609" style="s2">you know these are the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:01.530" style="s2">that are emerging now in our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.609" end="00:37:04.080" style="s2">milieu they&#39;re gonna force us they think</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.530" end="00:37:06.300" style="s2">hard about again teachers Authority</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.080" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">parent parental authority</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.300" end="00:37:12.089" style="s2">what does Authority look like where does</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:15.270" style="s2">a healthy if form of hierarchy look like</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.089" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">after post modernity if we don&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.270" end="00:37:18.020" style="s2">that then the educational system is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:20.790" style="s2">going to be a mess for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.020" end="00:37:23.490" style="s2">because there&#39;ll be no way to lock in</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.790" end="00:37:25.830" style="s2">any dynamics of teach really Authority</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.490" end="00:37:28.859" style="s2">in a way to embrace the role student had</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.830" end="00:37:31.710" style="s2">no way to you know with dignity and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.859" end="00:37:34.970" style="s2">expertise work as a teacher well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.710" end="00:37:38.130" style="s2">that that word authority even I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.970" end="00:37:41.460" style="s2">you&#39;ll get some pushback and probably do</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.130" end="00:37:43.740" style="s2">get some pushback just in so far as that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.460" end="00:37:47.550" style="s2">that that has some stink to it people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.740" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">oh yeah that idea certainly not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.550" end="00:37:51.690" style="s2">postmodern because but here&#39;s your right</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:53.730" style="s2">but here&#39;s where the post modernists</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.690" end="00:37:55.950" style="s2">always steps on their own foot because</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.730" end="00:37:59.730" style="s2">by whose authority that they get to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.950" end="00:38:01.050" style="s2">critique me is the post modernists</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.730" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">actually wields a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.050" end="00:38:04.440" style="s2">authority in our society the post</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:07.410" style="s2">modernist has a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.440" end="00:38:09.810" style="s2">power in some ways and with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.410" end="00:38:12.270" style="s2">authority of all the other academics and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.810" end="00:38:14.700" style="s2">post modernists will condemn people open</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.270" end="00:38:15.490" style="s2">with you know so there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.700" end="00:38:18.550" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.490" end="00:38:20.080" style="s2">the dynamics of power and authority what</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.550" end="00:38:22.050" style="s2">you need to do and learn the unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.080" end="00:38:25.450" style="s2">of the healthy forms of power according</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.050" end="00:38:30.730" style="s2">right and the idea that that hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.450" end="00:38:33.580" style="s2">should and even could go away is is just</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.730" end="00:38:34.450" style="s2">patently absurd but that kind of and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.580" end="00:38:36.850" style="s2">don&#39;t want to stray too far from</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.450" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">education but that just seems like one</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.850" end="00:38:43.180" style="s2">of the the pitfalls that just</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">continually resurfaces in this pop this</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.180" end="00:38:50.350" style="s2">postmodern mindset it does and again it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:52.150" style="s2">to me it&#39;s it&#39;s a simple conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.350" end="00:38:55.090" style="s2">confusion in some ways again there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.150" end="00:38:58.210" style="s2">there are pathological hierarchies no</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.090" end="00:39:01.150" style="s2">doubt from day one in humanity and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.210" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">fact if you look at mcdr natee you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.150" end="00:39:07.990" style="s2">think of modernity as a way to propagate</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:09.940" style="s2">you know rapidly propagate unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.990" end="00:39:13.840" style="s2">hierarchy like that&#39;s what modernity did</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.940" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">in many ways so but there are very</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.840" end="00:39:17.590" style="s2">healthy forms of of hierarchy - and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:20.380" style="s2">they&#39;re like health enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.590" end="00:39:21.880" style="s2">authority and so it&#39;s it&#39;s about moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.380" end="00:39:24.010" style="s2">past the moment of critique and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.880" end="00:39:27.460" style="s2">post-modernism into the moment of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.010" end="00:39:32.200" style="s2">reimburse and that&#39;s again it I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.460" end="00:39:35.890" style="s2">that emotional dynamic and without the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.200" end="00:39:37.780" style="s2">right training in educational context</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.890" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">where there&#39;s an emotional openness to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.780" end="00:39:41.350" style="s2">learning at an emotional openness to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">mutual understanding and these things as</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.350" end="00:39:45.010" style="s2">you&#39;re saying how do we change the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">emotional life of the student such that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.010" end="00:39:52.119" style="s2">they become equipped to learn in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:54.300" style="s2">different way so yeah so I hate to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.119" end="00:39:56.980" style="s2">it again but I do think some of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.300" end="00:40:00.790" style="s2">pathologies of our public culture are</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.980" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">very clear manifestations of this broken</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.790" end="00:40:04.210" style="s2">kind of slapped together educational</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:06.070" style="s2">system that still can&#39;t figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.210" end="00:40:10.210" style="s2">it&#39;s modern or postmodern or meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.070" end="00:40:12.780" style="s2">and I think we&#39;re gonna see situation</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.210" end="00:40:15.040" style="s2">perhaps with the biosphere and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.780" end="00:40:16.660" style="s2">geopolitical conflicts such that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:18.280" style="s2">going to be I think thrown into a</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.660" end="00:40:20.740" style="s2">situation of either regressing back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.280" end="00:40:22.869" style="s2">modern practices or moving into a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.740" end="00:40:24.700" style="s2">dynamic very interesting meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.869" end="00:40:25.410" style="s2">form of Education and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.700" end="00:40:28.740" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.410" end="00:40:32.100" style="s2">and most of these days yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.740" end="00:40:35.810" style="s2">the pushback and the chasm that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.100" end="00:40:37.830" style="s2">be widening widening between what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.810" end="00:40:40.920" style="s2">don&#39;t really want to get into liberal</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.830" end="00:40:44.220" style="s2">and conservative as labels but they</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.920" end="00:40:48.390" style="s2">certainly surface but the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.220" end="00:40:51.360" style="s2">right and you know the postmodern being</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.390" end="00:40:54.390" style="s2">certainly more on the on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.360" end="00:40:56.850" style="s2">then the right being much more modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.390" end="00:41:00.210" style="s2">and it just it&#39;s just this battle and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.850" end="00:41:04.080" style="s2">and I hear I hear people who I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.210" end="00:41:06.060" style="s2">Dave Rubin had Tom&#39;s soul on his program</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.080" end="00:41:08.040" style="s2">recently and he has lots of great ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.060" end="00:41:11.220" style="s2">and then it comes to education and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.040" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">just seems such a reductionist modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.220" end="00:41:18.090" style="s2">approach that I&#39;m just banging my head</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:21.270" style="s2">thinking such a smart guy and any it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.090" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">not him alone but it&#39;s just like like he</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.270" end="00:41:26.460" style="s2">said so this sort of call for going back</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.380" style="s2">to much more traditional at least that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.460" end="00:41:30.420" style="s2">the the language that I&#39;ve heard I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.380" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">certainly not an expert in his work but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.420" end="00:41:35.940" style="s2">I think we can&#39;t think about going back</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:38.760" style="s2">there but we also can&#39;t live in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.940" end="00:41:41.580" style="s2">postmodern censor this meta modern seems</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.760" end="00:41:44.660" style="s2">like a way forward where we are really</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.580" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">thinking more deeply about the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.660" end="00:41:51.740" style="s2">and I guess as you as you&#39;ve written and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:54.690" style="s2">talked about the the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.740" end="00:41:58.020" style="s2">education system and your thoughts of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.690" end="00:42:01.770" style="s2">where should be going and perhaps could</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.020" end="00:42:05.730" style="s2">be although as IRA as I read it it seems</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.770" end="00:42:08.660" style="s2">just so utopian almost mind-blowing ly</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.730" end="00:42:11.340" style="s2">impossible from where we are right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.660" end="00:42:12.900" style="s2">so I guess if you would kind of dive</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.340" end="00:42:15.510" style="s2">into that a little bit like what what</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.900" end="00:42:17.670" style="s2">explain that that difference between</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.510" end="00:42:20.810" style="s2">where we are right now where you think</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.670" end="00:42:24.540" style="s2">we should be in the future yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.810" end="00:42:28.670" style="s2">great I think the best bit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.540" end="00:42:31.640" style="s2">characterize us so you know in my book I</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.670" end="00:42:36.750" style="s2">think about meta modern education</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.640" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">emerging as a result of the intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.750" end="00:42:41.750" style="s2">global dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">in terms of the economic systems the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.750" end="00:42:47.450" style="s2">biosphere and identity and culture which</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:50.359" style="s2">means I&#39;ve seen many modern education</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.450" end="00:42:53.299" style="s2">emerge out of the pressure of global</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.359" end="00:42:55.790" style="s2">crisis and the crisis is a multi fold</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.299" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">crisis and right now we&#39;re living with</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:42:59.180" style="s2">educational systems that are more or</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:01.940" style="s2">less pretending in the back the multi</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.180" end="00:43:05.180" style="s2">fold crisis of the world system isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.940" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">occurring so now if you imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.180" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">this crisis is occurring that actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:12.589" style="s2">ten years from now it may be hard to run</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.280" end="00:43:14.059" style="s2">actually literally like logistically if</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.589" end="00:43:16.010" style="s2">for a bunch of reasons hard to run</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.059" end="00:43:17.480" style="s2">schools the way that they&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.010" end="00:43:19.940" style="s2">being run so we&#39;re gonna be forced to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.480" end="00:43:20.930" style="s2">read think it in a major way and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.940" end="00:43:24.950" style="s2">gonna have all of this new technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.930" end="00:43:26.990" style="s2">and so what I&#39;m predicting in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.950" end="00:43:30.020" style="s2">as a futurist as an educational futurist</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.990" end="00:43:32.450" style="s2">is that we&#39;re going to see the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.020" end="00:43:37.250" style="s2">of what&#39;s more like a network of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.450" end="00:43:40.730" style="s2">educational hubs that so instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.250" end="00:43:44.540" style="s2">large single high school you have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.730" end="00:43:49.190" style="s2">dozen or so small locations which serve</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.540" end="00:43:51.970" style="s2">as nexus points for teachers students</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.190" end="00:43:54.680" style="s2">and community to come together around</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.970" end="00:43:57.740" style="s2">intergenerational help and transmission</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.680" end="00:44:01.540" style="s2">of the youth so it&#39;s essentially a kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.740" end="00:44:05.240" style="s2">of a vision for a Redux of Paul Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.540" end="00:44:07.609" style="s2">you know D schooling idea which is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.240" end="00:44:10.339" style="s2">idea that in many societies there</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.609" end="00:44:12.559" style="s2">weren&#39;t schools and in fact that kids</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.339" end="00:44:14.750" style="s2">just picked up all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.559" end="00:44:16.579" style="s2">through their spontaneous interactions</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.750" end="00:44:19.309" style="s2">with the elders who would allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.579" end="00:44:21.829" style="s2">observe work participate in work hold</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.309" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">special sessions etc you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.829" end="00:44:25.430" style="s2">giving like something like an</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:28.430" style="s2">educational credit card which allows you</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.430" end="00:44:31.250" style="s2">to redeem for time with an elder some</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.430" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">kind of educational interaction and now</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.250" end="00:44:35.599" style="s2">fast-forward to the internet and you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:38.150" style="s2">that we could set something up like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.599" end="00:44:40.430" style="s2">with a skill and time sharing network</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.150" end="00:44:43.790" style="s2">that&#39;s focused around the single</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.430" end="00:44:45.829" style="s2">educational hub and so so I&#39;ve talked a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.790" end="00:44:48.490" style="s2">lot in my book about that contrast</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.829" end="00:44:50.990" style="s2">between the kind of large centralized</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.490" end="00:44:52.369" style="s2">modern / postmodern school</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.990" end="00:44:54.650" style="s2">system which is straining under</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.369" end="00:44:58.730" style="s2">resources and all kinds of problems and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.650" end="00:45:01.490" style="s2">this kind of agile flexible meta</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.730" end="00:45:04.760" style="s2">moderate educational hub network which</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.490" end="00:45:07.880" style="s2">will actually free the youth and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.760" end="00:45:09.800" style="s2">parents and so again you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.880" end="00:45:11.690" style="s2">it&#39;s utopian and I explicitly say in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.800" end="00:45:13.640" style="s2">book that some of what we need to do now</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.690" end="00:45:16.690" style="s2">and some of what characterizes the meta</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.640" end="00:45:19.820" style="s2">modern is concrete utopian theorist</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.690" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">which is to say realistic alternative</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.820" end="00:45:25.970" style="s2">futures that are adjacent to this one</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:27.860" style="s2">that would require some miracles but</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.970" end="00:45:29.510" style="s2">that are very real given what we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.860" end="00:45:31.010" style="s2">available this is like the work</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.510" end="00:45:32.180" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller did it when you said</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.010" end="00:45:34.130" style="s2">listen we have everything we need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.180" end="00:45:36.470" style="s2">feed everyone and live happily we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.130" end="00:45:38.750" style="s2">everything materially that we need it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.470" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">a question of politics and the moral</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.750" end="00:45:41.900" style="s2">will and I feel the same way about</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:45.050" style="s2">education we don&#39;t need to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.900" end="00:45:46.130" style="s2">education a scarce resource anymore we</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.050" end="00:45:49.400" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have all of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.130" end="00:45:51.410" style="s2">competition and all of this elite status</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.400" end="00:45:53.510" style="s2">and all of these accoutrements and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.410" end="00:45:57.050" style="s2">problems with the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.510" end="00:45:58.580" style="s2">traditional modern education we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.050" end="00:46:00.260" style="s2">begin to think very differently but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.580" end="00:46:02.270" style="s2">requires a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.260" end="00:46:03.320" style="s2">changing not just the schools and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.270" end="00:46:05.330" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying have to see in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.320" end="00:46:07.580" style="s2">context of this meta crisis you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.330" end="00:46:10.010" style="s2">see in the context of economic systems</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.580" end="00:46:11.060" style="s2">changing for example like technological</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.010" end="00:46:12.950" style="s2">unemployment it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.060" end="00:46:15.500" style="s2">basically can come guarantee I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.950" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">changed a game in education you also</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.500" end="00:46:18.980" style="s2">have a collage achill crisis which can</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:21.619" style="s2">change the game in terms of disrupting</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.980" end="00:46:23.900" style="s2">supply chains and bus routes and things</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.619" end="00:46:25.820" style="s2">of that nature you have the cheapening</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.900" end="00:46:28.100" style="s2">of educational technologies like</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.820" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">computers which can now be put in every</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.100" end="00:46:33.050" style="s2">kid&#39;s hand in a very realistic way and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:35.270" style="s2">do stuff unimaginable even five years</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.050" end="00:46:38.390" style="s2">ago so all of these factors are going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.270" end="00:46:41.480" style="s2">congeal and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s strange</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.390" end="00:46:43.369" style="s2">actually to think about the educational</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.480" end="00:46:45.020" style="s2">system ten years from now and wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.369" end="00:46:47.960" style="s2">think of it as like a better version of</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.020" end="00:46:49.130" style="s2">the one we have you know like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.960" end="00:46:52.790" style="s2">think about something totally different</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.130" end="00:46:55.640" style="s2">emerging yeah we sometimes joke here</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.790" end="00:46:57.890" style="s2">think about you know like when we think</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.640" end="00:46:59.420" style="s2">about the the schools of the past the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.890" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">same way that we thought about seat</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.420" end="00:47:02.530" style="s2">belts in cars like how could we ever</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:04.870" style="s2">have ridden around and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.530" end="00:47:07.480" style="s2">without seatbelts and that&#39;s absurd</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.870" end="00:47:10.440" style="s2">right but you know when will we get to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.480" end="00:47:14.170" style="s2">there and how do we get to there because</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.440" end="00:47:19.330" style="s2">as many have pointed out we continually</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.170" end="00:47:22.200" style="s2">try to refine a system that is doing or</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.330" end="00:47:25.300" style="s2">has done things that are not obsolete so</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.200" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">what we have to redefine how we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.300" end="00:47:30.340" style="s2">that and you know what is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:35.470" style="s2">what are the commodities in education</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.340" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">that will be I guess non-negotiable for</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.470" end="00:47:43.330" style="s2">success of individuals as in 10 20 30 40</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">years is it it&#39;s clearly not content</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.330" end="00:47:48.340" style="s2">mastery and we talked about just</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:50.430" style="s2">yesterday had a conversation was with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.340" end="00:47:53.290" style="s2">school talking about how different it</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.430" end="00:47:55.450" style="s2">should be it&#39;s not that we should expect</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.290" end="00:47:58.120" style="s2">people to come out of any course or</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.450" end="00:47:59.950" style="s2">class or school with content mastery but</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.120" end="00:48:02.920" style="s2">to be able to think like a Content area</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.950" end="00:48:04.840" style="s2">expert if you will and the difference</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.920" end="00:48:09.750" style="s2">between being an expert and having</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.840" end="00:48:13.060" style="s2">expertise and the the ideas and that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.750" end="00:48:14.380" style="s2">even to go so far as is how that looks</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.060" end="00:48:17.820" style="s2">as a teacher right so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.380" end="00:48:21.010" style="s2">delivering the content we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.820" end="00:48:22.360" style="s2">architecting the design of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.010" end="00:48:26.410" style="s2">instruction so that we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.360" end="00:48:30.040" style="s2">scenarios in which we can find just that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.410" end="00:48:32.830" style="s2">fine razor line as we demonstrate the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.040" end="00:48:35.290" style="s2">artistry of teaching to know when to</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.830" end="00:48:36.820" style="s2">push when to pull that come back you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.290" end="00:48:38.830" style="s2">know sort of what you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.820" end="00:48:41.500" style="s2">earlier is that&#39;s the artistry of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.830" end="00:48:44.770" style="s2">teaching but we also have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.500" end="00:48:47.490" style="s2">architects of the design so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.770" end="00:48:50.410" style="s2">that&#39;s those situations can arise and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.490" end="00:48:52.990" style="s2">you know that that therein lies the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.410" end="00:48:55.090" style="s2">biggest challenge so is there is there</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.990" end="00:48:58.600" style="s2">any difference in your mind and what</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.090" end="00:49:00.580" style="s2">what adults will need in 10 20 30 40</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.600" end="00:49:02.980" style="s2">years from sort of the conventional</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.580" end="00:49:06.520" style="s2">wisdom of what&#39;s being pushed</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.980" end="00:49:08.440" style="s2">I mean if anyone&#39;s telling you they know</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.520" end="00:49:11.320" style="s2">what the world&#39;s gonna be like in 20</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.440" end="00:49:13.990" style="s2">years from now you know raise your</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.320" end="00:49:15.490" style="s2">eyebrows and be skeptical all right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.990" end="00:49:17.800" style="s2">that would be my first response and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.490" end="00:49:20.109" style="s2">think that is in fact the novelty of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.800" end="00:49:22.390" style="s2">meta modern position you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.109" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">postmodern kind of denies the historical</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.390" end="00:49:25.960" style="s2">and denies the unfolding almost denies</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:28.210" style="s2">reality so it&#39;s very hard to know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.960" end="00:49:29.970" style="s2">they would predict about the future you</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.210" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">know the modern had this lockstep</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.970" end="00:49:34.660" style="s2">progressive definition of linear history</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:35.109" style="s2">and it was getting better and better and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.660" end="00:49:37.930" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.109" end="00:49:39.850" style="s2">you know the meta modern stands and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.930" end="00:49:44.320" style="s2">looks at both and then looks just at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.850" end="00:49:46.510" style="s2">concrete situation and says wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.320" end="00:49:48.220" style="s2">a very dynamic moment in a historical</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.510" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">unfolding and we&#39;re caught up in certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.220" end="00:49:56.740" style="s2">logics that are moving like threw us</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:50:00.430" style="s2">into something unknown and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.740" end="00:50:02.440" style="s2">that means we need to teach people how</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.430" end="00:50:04.570" style="s2">to learn like and this is again the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.440" end="00:50:07.600" style="s2">classic constructivist idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.570" end="00:50:10.090" style="s2">education should be about how to forever</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.600" end="00:50:12.750" style="s2">be educating yourself educating should</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.090" end="00:50:16.450" style="s2">be about how to forever be learning and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.750" end="00:50:20.250" style="s2">in contexts that are unpredictable and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.450" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">uncertain and you know in contexts where</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.250" end="00:50:25.240" style="s2">the future really is on them that means</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:27.340" style="s2">that we need to prepare people to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.240" end="00:50:29.410" style="s2">ready to learn it should be always</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.340" end="00:50:30.250" style="s2">curious and observant of their</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.410" end="00:50:32.320" style="s2">surroundings</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.250" end="00:50:35.170" style="s2">and you know all of these other factors</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.320" end="00:50:37.960" style="s2">which are very different from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.170" end="00:50:41.680" style="s2">very domesticated modern predictable</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.960" end="00:50:43.750" style="s2">form of Education you know in fact being</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.680" end="00:50:48.250" style="s2">a very good student in some schools</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.750" end="00:50:50.710" style="s2">today may make you ill-equipped to be in</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.250" end="00:50:53.530" style="s2">other contexts that are more you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.710" end="00:50:55.750" style="s2">dynamic and if you look at the people</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.530" end="00:50:59.140" style="s2">who are like leading the charge in some</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.750" end="00:51:01.290" style="s2">areas of technological development real</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.140" end="00:51:05.320" style="s2">innovators often they have very unusual</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.290" end="00:51:07.270" style="s2">educational histories and fact often we</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.320" end="00:51:08.859" style="s2">didn&#39;t do traditional modern schooling</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.270" end="00:51:11.229" style="s2">well at all</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.859" end="00:51:15.239" style="s2">so if we could give those types of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.229" end="00:51:17.709" style="s2">unique experiences ever get instead of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.239" end="00:51:19.930" style="s2">getting some of them to be these nicely</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.709" end="00:51:22.900" style="s2">packaged modern products of Education</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.930" end="00:51:24.700" style="s2">which no longer fit on the Shelf because</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.900" end="00:51:27.549" style="s2">turning michelle&#39;s anymore for that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.700" end="00:51:29.890" style="s2">don&#39;t wear that kind of product you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.549" end="00:51:31.569" style="s2">that&#39;s is very outmoded and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.890" end="00:51:34.420" style="s2">uncomfortable to hold that complexity</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.569" end="00:51:36.130" style="s2">indictments of them you know and we need</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.420" end="00:51:38.859" style="s2">to learn to turn the kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.130" end="00:51:43.239" style="s2">anxiety of the unknowing into curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.859" end="00:51:45.489" style="s2">and so that&#39;s again the modern and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.239" end="00:51:48.549" style="s2">postmodern step back from that awareness</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.489" end="00:51:50.950" style="s2">of that the world is the world is to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.549" end="00:51:53.380" style="s2">known in the world is to be is an actual</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.950" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">exploration right it&#39;s not the modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.380" end="00:51:56.369" style="s2">building of progress where we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">build this perfect things that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.369" end="00:52:04.509" style="s2">society humans are evolving and continue</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:05.799" style="s2">to explore so so yeah I would if I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.509" end="00:52:09.219" style="s2">going to build a curriculum it would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.799" end="00:52:11.890" style="s2">about specifically teaching adolescents</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.219" end="00:52:13.979" style="s2">about the learning sciences and about</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.890" end="00:52:17.709" style="s2">their own brains and about their own</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.979" end="00:52:19.959" style="s2">bodies and how the body adapts and heals</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.709" end="00:52:22.509" style="s2">and how the mind learns and evolves so</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.959" end="00:52:24.309" style="s2">that you would give them sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.509" end="00:52:27.069" style="s2">over their own future development both</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.309" end="00:52:31.199" style="s2">physically and psychologically I had</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.069" end="00:52:34.869" style="s2">that metacognition that that is rarely</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.199" end="00:52:37.390" style="s2">we rarely have time for in an industrial</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.869" end="00:52:41.819" style="s2">model and even in lots of classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.390" end="00:52:45.880" style="s2">today that that being okay with</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.819" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">uncertainty and not knowing and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:52.869" style="s2">that we we certainly know lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:54.789" style="s2">but there are there&#39;s an infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.869" end="00:52:58.119" style="s2">larger amount of things that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.789" end="00:52:59.890" style="s2">know so what questions do we need to ask</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.119" end="00:53:01.869" style="s2">right what are what are the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.890" end="00:53:05.349" style="s2">beautiful questions that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.869" end="00:53:08.529" style="s2">pursuing because there&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.349" end="00:53:10.839" style="s2">unbelievable amount of questions and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.529" end="00:53:13.630" style="s2">should probably choose wisely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.839" end="00:53:16.959" style="s2">that&#39;s right and you know the dominating</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.630" end="00:53:19.299" style="s2">question driving education in modern</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.959" end="00:53:22.330" style="s2">context is how do I find a spot in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.299" end="00:53:23.890" style="s2">social system eg how do I get a job</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.330" end="00:53:25.000" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to reduce all of it to</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.890" end="00:53:27.370" style="s2">that because of course has always been</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.000" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">streams of the humanities and other</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.370" end="00:53:32.500" style="s2">things but that&#39;s mostly how the modern</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:34.630" style="s2">system was built in terms of human</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.500" end="00:53:36.280" style="s2">capital Theory where the educational</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.630" end="00:53:38.920" style="s2">system is actually designed in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.280" end="00:53:40.660" style="s2">produce workers for the economy to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.920" end="00:53:43.180" style="s2">defeat the human capital into the system</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.660" end="00:53:44.740" style="s2">and it sounds critical in both modern</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.180" end="00:53:46.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s just it&#39;s just right there and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.740" end="00:53:50.740" style="s2">from a modern view it&#39;s it makes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.600" end="00:53:52.120" style="s2">of sense you know and and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.740" end="00:53:55.330" style="s2">the dominant question for such a long</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.120" end="00:53:57.610" style="s2">time and postmodern kind of said just</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.330" end="00:53:59.380" style="s2">make up your own question you know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.610" end="00:53:59.830" style="s2">any questions as good as good as any</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.380" end="00:54:02.140" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.830" end="00:54:03.910" style="s2">I think the meta modern may signal a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.140" end="00:54:05.830" style="s2">return to the questions humans have</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.910" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">always asked themselves my favorite one</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.830" end="00:54:13.450" style="s2">being what is the human human yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:16.300" style="s2">is a human and and so you know even</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.450" end="00:54:18.190" style="s2">beyond civics and the teaching of</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.920" end="00:56:32.680" style="s2">question I mean the theory of multiple</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.040" end="00:56:51.820" style="s2">mentioned that&#39;s the kind of pinnacle of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.050" end="00:56:54.910" style="s2">the modern way of viewing the mind</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.820" end="00:56:56.830" style="s2">isolated to a single number Howard said</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.910" end="00:56:58.869" style="s2">well actually the mind evolved over</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.830" end="00:57:00.580" style="s2">evolutionary time and there are these</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.869" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">different kind of modules that came out</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.580" end="00:57:05.740" style="s2">of evolution and populated the mind with</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:07.390" style="s2">these different capacities aren&#39;t our</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.740" end="00:57:10.180" style="s2">intelligences and there&#39;s been various</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.390" end="00:57:12.070" style="s2">lists where he&#39;s added a few and and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.180" end="00:57:14.260" style="s2">you know I really appreciate that theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.070" end="00:57:15.910" style="s2">so that I think is important you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.260" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">now Howard was very careful to say like</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.910" end="00:57:20.470" style="s2">there aren&#39;t many measures of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:22.570" style="s2">different intelligences you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.470" end="00:57:25.270" style="s2">can&#39;t reduce those to a standardized</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.570" end="00:57:26.710" style="s2">test which is of course what precise</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.270" end="00:57:28.810" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s like the first question</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.710" end="00:57:30.070" style="s2">people ask you especially the principles</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.810" end="00:57:31.780" style="s2">and stuff you know well there are tests</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.070" end="00:57:33.220" style="s2">for these different so you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.780" end="00:57:36.340" style="s2">think that&#39;s important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.220" end="00:57:38.350" style="s2">about his work but I&#39;d rather actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.340" end="00:57:41.230" style="s2">talk about Howard&#39;s work more recently</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.350" end="00:57:43.810" style="s2">which is his work in ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.230" end="00:57:46.570" style="s2">professional ethics and this to me is</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.810" end="00:57:48.050" style="s2">actually where I see his greatest</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.570" end="00:57:52.550" style="s2">contribution tobogganing</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.050" end="00:57:54.800" style="s2">I totally honor Howard so much and sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.550" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">of privilege to work with him and his</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.800" end="00:58:00.230" style="s2">theory of multiple intelligences was</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:02.360" style="s2">with Baron has had this impact I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.230" end="00:58:03.950" style="s2">he&#39;s the work in ethics has been less</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.360" end="00:58:08.330" style="s2">talked about by educators in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.950" end="00:58:10.820" style="s2">and in fact what he identified were</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.330" end="00:58:13.280" style="s2">forms of engagement and excellence and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.820" end="00:58:15.530" style="s2">ethics that constitute quote good work</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.280" end="00:58:16.850" style="s2">and so that one of the answers to that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.530" end="00:58:19.190" style="s2">question of what youth education be</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.850" end="00:58:21.740" style="s2">about is you know it should be about</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.190" end="00:58:23.510" style="s2">giving people prepared to do good work</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.740" end="00:58:25.070" style="s2">you know it&#39;s something we just people</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.510" end="00:58:26.570" style="s2">laze around if there&#39;s a basic income</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.070" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">guarantee even if there&#39;s a basic income</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.570" end="00:58:30.080" style="s2">guarantee people are going to want to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:32.290" style="s2">good work and what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.080" end="00:58:35.480" style="s2">and so Howard&#39;s answering these deep</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.290" end="00:58:39.020" style="s2">philosophical questions in about</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.480" end="00:58:40.460" style="s2">education and it&#39;s the return to those</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.020" end="00:58:41.630" style="s2">types of questions that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.460" end="00:58:44.600" style="s2">need to characterize the educational</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.630" end="00:58:46.820" style="s2">system going forward because you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.600" end="00:58:48.440" style="s2">even how we get food and how we get a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.820" end="00:58:49.730" style="s2">paycheck it&#39;s going to be very different</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.440" end="00:58:52.130" style="s2">weaving forward so that means we need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.730" end="00:58:53.990" style="s2">think basically about how even under</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.130" end="00:58:56.630" style="s2">those conditions can I be a good person</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.990" end="00:58:58.820" style="s2">what does that mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.630" end="00:59:02.180" style="s2">interesting to note that he saw and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.820" end="00:59:04.070" style="s2">documented empirically the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.180" end="00:59:07.820" style="s2">breakdown in professional ethics in</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.070" end="00:59:10.310" style="s2">journalism and this was in the 90s early</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.820" end="00:59:13.070" style="s2">2000s and we&#39;re seeing that play out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.310" end="00:59:15.410" style="s2">course and a lot of it had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.070" end="00:59:18.470" style="s2">the intergenerational transmission of</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.410" end="00:59:20.810" style="s2">the ethics themselves break down between</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.470" end="00:59:23.390" style="s2">the older journalists and the younger</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.810" end="00:59:26.630" style="s2">journalists in terms of transmitting</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.390" end="00:59:29.150" style="s2">those kinds of professional ethics so</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.630" end="00:59:30.410" style="s2">it&#39;s just again something to note and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.150" end="00:59:31.609" style="s2">yeah when I think Howard Gardner I</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.410" end="00:59:32.600" style="s2">always think those two things and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.609" end="00:59:35.330" style="s2">always want to talk about the ethics</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.600" end="00:59:36.710" style="s2">because everyone loves the multiple</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.330" end="00:59:38.869" style="s2">intelligences but in fact I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.710" end="00:59:41.480" style="s2">the ethics work where the most radical</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.869" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">implications unfold because many posts</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.480" end="00:59:45.740" style="s2">because many post modernists embrace the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:46.850" style="s2">multiple intelligence theory it makes</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.740" end="00:59:48.980" style="s2">modern is uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.850" end="00:59:51.410" style="s2">madam honors of course love it but the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.980" end="00:59:54.410" style="s2">ethics and the idea that there are right</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.410" end="00:59:56.950" style="s2">and wrong ways to be and better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.410" end="00:59:59.140" style="s2">forms of journalism</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.950" end="01:00:02.350" style="s2">and the idea that we should strive</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.140" end="01:00:06.040" style="s2">towards professional ethics and educate</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.350" end="01:00:12.100" style="s2">for ethics it&#39;s hard to say in some</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.040" end="01:00:15.190" style="s2">contexts so there is is it hard in ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.100" end="01:00:18.550" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s a value Laden approach</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.190" end="01:00:21.310" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s evaluative approaches and</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.550" end="01:00:23.350" style="s2">it&#39;s my definitions gonna say listen</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.310" end="01:00:29.470" style="s2">some people are outperforming others in</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.350" end="01:00:31.480" style="s2">the area of ethical behavior and again</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.470" end="01:00:33.940" style="s2">this gets back to what who&#39;s allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.480" end="01:00:37.500" style="s2">say that well by what authority can you</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.940" end="01:00:41.590" style="s2">condemn someone and these are deep</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.500" end="01:00:43.330" style="s2">pedagogical or issues of of Education so</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.590" end="01:00:47.020" style="s2">so that would be my response is we bring</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.330" end="01:00:49.540" style="s2">all the powers work you know forward but</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.020" end="01:00:50.920" style="s2">I think the hardest work to be done is</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.540" end="01:00:52.780" style="s2">not gonna be around bringing in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.920" end="01:00:55.380" style="s2">intelligences but instead bringing in</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.780" end="01:00:58.390" style="s2">his focus on professional ethics and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.380" end="01:01:02.020" style="s2">curriculums that foster deep ethical</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.390" end="01:01:04.840" style="s2">reflection that&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.020" end="01:01:06.940" style="s2">interesting and thought because as you</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.840" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">noted and we certainly know secret or</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.940" end="01:01:11.620" style="s2">well maybe it is a secret to lots of</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:14.730" style="s2">folks but you know as the development of</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.620" end="01:01:18.190" style="s2">artificial intelligence and machines</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.730" end="01:01:21.550" style="s2">continue the world of work will</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.190" end="01:01:24.190" style="s2">inevitably change which i think is a a</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.550" end="01:01:26.050" style="s2">reasonable argument for universal basic</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.190" end="01:01:28.960" style="s2">income whether you&#39;re for it or against</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.050" end="01:01:31.510" style="s2">it but it certainly it is a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:33.490" style="s2">discussion to have which of course then</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.510" end="01:01:36.850" style="s2">leads to the incentivization and why</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.490" end="01:01:40.890" style="s2">would people work if they already get</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.850" end="01:01:44.050" style="s2">money and all of that so is there a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.890" end="01:01:45.550" style="s2">resource or a book or something that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.050" end="01:01:47.050" style="s2">would recommend because I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.550" end="01:01:50.190" style="s2">familiar with Gardner&#39;s work around</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.050" end="01:01:52.450" style="s2">ethics just like most people apparently</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.190" end="01:01:55.480" style="s2">ya know the book is just called good</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.450" end="01:01:58.350" style="s2">work and then there&#39;s a few other that</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.480" end="01:02:01.750" style="s2">follow from that research project and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.350" end="01:02:03.640" style="s2">you know he picked up with some people</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.750" end="01:02:07.080" style="s2">who studied with Larry Kohlberg who was</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.640" end="01:02:08.230" style="s2">the great moral psychologists of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.080" end="01:02:11.020" style="s2">6780</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.230" end="01:02:14.290" style="s2">no Kohlberg lay a stage model of moral</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.020" end="01:02:17.290" style="s2">development that went from egocentric to</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.290" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">ethnocentric to world centric and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.290" end="01:02:22.660" style="s2">a very kind of meta modern hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:24.460" style="s2">view of psychological development you</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.660" end="01:02:25.990" style="s2">could interpret it in a modern way and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.460" end="01:02:28.329" style="s2">think of it just as flattered that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.990" end="01:02:29.800" style="s2">climb towards growth to goodness but in</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.329" end="01:02:32.619" style="s2">fact Kohlberg was much more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.800" end="01:02:34.750" style="s2">thinking about ethical matters and he</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.619" end="01:02:38.230" style="s2">saw the possibility for very abstract</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.750" end="01:02:40.359" style="s2">complex forms of evil so the the stage</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.230" end="01:02:43.990" style="s2">amount of Kohlberg also factors in here</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.359" end="01:02:46.150" style="s2">and again resuscitating her or bringing</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.990" end="01:02:47.950" style="s2">life back into these developmental</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.150" end="01:02:49.420" style="s2">models I think is an important part of</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.950" end="01:02:51.060" style="s2">the future of Education you know these</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.420" end="01:02:53.980" style="s2">are some of the ways that you foster</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.060" end="01:02:56.230" style="s2">growth in people is by actually showing</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.980" end="01:02:58.780" style="s2">them a map of their own potentials so</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.230" end="01:03:02.410" style="s2">know if you read Kohlberg and you read</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.780" end="01:03:05.050" style="s2">the six stages of moral development when</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.410" end="01:03:07.000" style="s2">you read that sixth stage you usually</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.050" end="01:03:11.290" style="s2">there&#39;s an aspiration to try to attain</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.000" end="01:03:12.280" style="s2">it unless you&#39;re so unless you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.290" end="01:03:14.619" style="s2">simple you think you&#39;re already there</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.280" end="01:03:16.900" style="s2">right but let me ideal would be the idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.619" end="01:03:18.579" style="s2">would be oh yes you know this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.900" end="01:03:20.170" style="s2">a better way this is higher and the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.579" end="01:03:22.630" style="s2">thing when you see sports excellence in</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.170" end="01:03:25.030" style="s2">sports there&#39;s a developmental path that</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.630" end="01:03:27.849" style="s2">led from learning to just kick a soccer</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.030" end="01:03:30.010" style="s2">ball to becoming a soccer star to</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.849" end="01:03:32.859" style="s2">becoming Pele there&#39;s this sequence of</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.010" end="01:03:34.660" style="s2">development developmental half and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.859" end="01:03:38.230" style="s2">you map that path and any soccer player</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.660" end="01:03:40.030" style="s2">is gonna want to climb that path and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.230" end="01:03:41.829" style="s2">I I think it&#39;s been a one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.030" end="01:03:43.660" style="s2">liabilities of the postmodern approach</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.829" end="01:03:46.510" style="s2">to kind of kick PJ out and kick the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.660" end="01:03:48.839" style="s2">developmental models out when I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.510" end="01:03:51.040" style="s2">they&#39;re actually very inspired mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.839" end="01:03:52.900" style="s2">so that was a long-winded answer to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.040" end="01:03:54.150" style="s2">Howard&#39;s book good work and he worked</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.900" end="01:03:56.680" style="s2">with people who worked with Kohlberg</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.150" end="01:03:58.750" style="s2">well I&#39;m mindful of your time and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.680" end="01:04:00.849" style="s2">perhaps that developmental psychology</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.750" end="01:04:03.640" style="s2">conversation is for another podcast</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.849" end="01:04:08.170" style="s2">episode because I think we could talk</p>
