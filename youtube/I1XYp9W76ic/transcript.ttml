<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">up until fifth grade and then after that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">so at 11 years old i actually went to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">boarding school</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">so i went to the boarding school in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:18.320" style="s2">uk from the age of 11</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">and was in school for seven years over</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.320" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">here while still living in saudi arabia</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">going back and forth between the two</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2">then i did really well in school i got</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:27.680" style="s2">into oxford university i studied</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">computer science there</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.680" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s also when i first started making</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">music and put out my first album</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">and um so i&#39;ve been living in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">permanently for</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">about 12 years but i&#39;ve been here on and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">off for more than 20 years so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:43.040" style="s2">the accent is</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">it confuses everybody whether i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.040" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">talking to british people or americans</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">whatever everyone always gets confused</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:52.720" style="s2">about where i&#39;m from</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">so how did you end up in saudi arabia um</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.720" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">so my dad is a medical doctor and when i</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">was a baby</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.360" style="s2">um my family was primarily living in</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">nigeria at the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">but um i don&#39;t remember any of this but</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve just been told the story</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">but he got he got the a great job</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">opportunity to go and work out in saudi</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">arabia</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">and um he took it and within a few days</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">the whole family moved moved out to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">saudi um i&#39;m i&#39;m one of five kids i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">four four brothers and sisters so um</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">apparently this was a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">shock to the system but i was just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.760" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">baby at the time so</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:31.280" style="s2">i have no recollection of it whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s how we ended up there</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">well that has certainly given you a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">perspective that most of us will not</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m definitely going to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">but you also say south coast of england</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">is uh do a lot of computers wash up on</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">the south coast of england that need</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">some computer scientists to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">them</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">which went super</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">hyper viral and led a lot of people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">discover me and led to appearances on a</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">i think a lot of people stuck around</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">because they saw okay this wasn&#39;t just</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">it was well below my maximum but that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">was actually part of the fun like my</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">worked out this whole marketing strategy</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">compassionate and decent that i thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">man this uh this really resonates and</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">the way you made the point without um</p>

<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">one so anyway i think you</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">because suddenly we were able to talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">about the absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">of trans women competing in women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">athletics yeah i mean i think it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">saying as well is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">i firstly i have quite a lot of trans</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">followers like once once you get once</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">your audience grows to a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">you know you have people across the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">board and all types of diversity in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">every sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">and the vast majority of them thought it</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">was hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">right like the messages i got from</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">actual from people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">trans were like</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">dude that&#39;s hilarious because i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">like with many things</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">the activists are not representative</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">of the people they claim to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">advocating for</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">and like you said there was no there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">no malice in it there was no</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">anger there was no all right i wanna you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">know attack people or whatever it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">this is silly so i&#39;m just gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">this logic</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">and instead of arguing against it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">just gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">okay if those are the rules here let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s sort of i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">a bit of a checkmate maneuver in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">of ways because people either need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">accept that i am the british women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">deadlift record holder</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">or they have to say okay that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">maybe we need to think about the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">uh anyone who says they&#39;re a woman</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">is a woman thing and should be allowed</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">to compete in sport etc</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">you know no matter how progressive</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">someone wants to be or how liberal</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">someone is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">there are still things that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">bad idea for a lot of reasons and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">think that&#39;s really why it resonated</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a terrible idea at the level</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">of sport and it&#39;s a tragic idea at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">point we get to things like</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">prisons right yeah i mean you can&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">well have a man declare himself a woman</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">in order to go to a woman&#39;s prison</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">you know so we we have to draw a line</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">somewhere and for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">and um when i was teaching at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">heather and i had many trans students it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">was actually not uncommon and we got</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">along with them</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">very well and we treated them</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">compassionately</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">and then encountering trans activism</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">we were driven out of evergreen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">like you say there&#39;s a dichotomy between</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">the activists and the people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">the community</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">for other reasons so it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">people need to be aware of because there</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">there&#39;s such a focus on the trans</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">activist that it seems like they speak</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">for the whole community but</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case yeah i think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">doing a massive disservice to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">totally honest because</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">let&#39;s be real i mean evergreen is a is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">unique place but most people don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">most people have never actually met a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">transgender person i only have because</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">i&#39;m in the public with my music and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">connected to so many people so</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">even if it&#39;s very small percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">population okay cool like i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">still met</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">you know maybe a dozen or so and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">and out of those people you know people</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">have generally been cool and nice and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">friendly and you know they&#39;re not trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">impose anything on on anybody so</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">i think it&#39;s uh it&#39;s actually quite a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">big problem because</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">like you said what most people will see</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">and how most people will judge things</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">is based off of the people who are who</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">have the loudest voice</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">and who are making all of these demands</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">and trying to force</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">people to use certain words and trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">to bully people and harass people and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">come into sports and do this and do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">and it makes a lot of people think like</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">you know for someone who doesn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">with a lot of nuance</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to forgive someone for</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">thinking oh my gosh like</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.519" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">all of these people are crazy because</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">every time i hear something about</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">this whole issue it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">totally bonkers and i know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">but yeah i think oftentimes with these</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">activists they just end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">more harm than good just like i think is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">happening in a lot of other things when</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">now with you know this whole inverted</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">commas anti-racism movement</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">which has become very racist in many in</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">many aspects</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">and it just to me to me it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">actually regressive</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">right people like to say that someone</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">like myself who&#39;s more you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">conservative leaning on many things</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">like to say that i&#39;m the one being</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">regressive but i&#39;m like look at what</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">you&#39;re doing here and here right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">the last week i spent two days just</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">getting attacked</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">for the fact that i said that it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">to be racist to white people</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">right like i was i was getting emails</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">dms mess like all kinds of horrible</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">saying no this is bad right like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">right this isn&#39;t good i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">should judge people based on the color</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">of their skin or call people</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">inferior or do any of this and then i</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">start getting attacked i&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">what kind of what is this world that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">that we&#39;re living in that that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">considered</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">uh some i don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">it&#39;s a strange thing i mean it&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">strange i think those of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">who uh without any ability to defend it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">i will just say those of us who get it</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">i think are having this constant</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">experience of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">i can&#39;t believe we&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s weird but you know i have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">theory about this and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve sort of observed over the years and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">this is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">i think any sort of social justice</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">movement let&#39;s call it that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">have a clearly defined finish line</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">ends up becoming what it&#39;s set to fight</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">and i think that we we&#39;re seeing this i</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">think we&#39;re living in an age of over</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">correction</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">where it&#39;s like okay we were things were</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">kind of at a happy balance in a medium</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">and that whoa it just sort of swung that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">and it went from it went from</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">you know if you go back decades it went</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">from okay it&#39;s acceptable to judge</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">people based on</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">the color of their skin to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">no that&#39;s not acceptable and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do that to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">no now we must judge people based on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">color of their skin in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">anti-racism and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:58.320" style="s2">and with that you&#39;ve got all this sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">of anti-white rhetoric and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.320" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">anti-jewish rhetoric and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">people trying to roll back</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">discrimination laws so that you can hire</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">based on and you&#39;re just like wait what</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.000" style="s2">is going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">or if i look at certain aspects of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.000" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">people call modern day feminism</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">which you know i have i have my own my</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">own issues with</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">but again it went from a movement that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">was like okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">women should have equal rights to men</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">and be allowed to vote you know inherit</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">property etc</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m on board and then it went to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">okay cool we&#39;ve kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">a happy balance you know at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">west not not everywhere in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">cool we&#39;ve we&#39;ve kind of got this the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">rules are fair the laws are equal</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:38.639" style="s2">and then it sort of evolved into men are</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">evil and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">kill all kill all men and and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:43.920" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got like the trans thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.920" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">that comes into it as well which</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">actually affects women more than it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">affects men</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">whether you&#39;re talking like changing</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">rooms or prisons or the sports thing or</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">and it just becomes confusing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">just like wait what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s going on here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">strange because it&#39;s all called progress</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not convinced that it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">oh i agree it is the um so the way i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">been saying it is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">there there is this idea in progressive</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">circles</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">about correcting the wrongs but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">actually divided into two camps</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">there are those of us who want to end</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">at least in the u.s i&#39;m not claiming</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">that we ever got to the goal</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">right but we knew what it was right we</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">knew</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">what what we were trying to achieve and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:47.519" style="s2">now we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">um begun attacking that very set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.519" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">objectives</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">in order to justify this uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:57.519" style="s2">this vindictive um</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">movement and i mean that you can say a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.519" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">lot of things about it but one thing i</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">think we can say</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.199" style="s2">with certainty is that from a systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t lead anywhere there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">there&#39;s no stable system you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">define</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.839" style="s2">that would uh match the objectives of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">the movement we see</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.839" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">tearing apart the us at the moment if</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">you were to institute their</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">their proposals you would end up with</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">warlordism and basically a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">state of lineages fighting against each</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">other which</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.399" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">if there&#39;s one great achievement of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">west it&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">we spotted that we needed to escape that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">and we we were</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">indeed headed there so yeah what what a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s weird it&#39;s like in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">things are better than they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">ever been but people insist that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">than they&#39;ve ever been or that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">haven&#39;t gotten better you&#39;ll hear people</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">saying things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">oh racism is just as bad as it was 50</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">it&#39;s just different and i&#39;m like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">right it&#39;s like no that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">a helpful statement and like you said</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">people wanting revenge rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">is is a big problem and from from a sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">of psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">i can understand how someone gets into</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">that mind state</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s not constructive it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">and it does move things it does move</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">things backwards because i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">most decent people across like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">whether someone is left leaning right</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">leaning centrist you know apolitical</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">i think when it comes to the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">ideas of you know around equality and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">fairness in in the sort of true sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">as much as that is achievable i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">most people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">pretty much on board most people i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:43.320" style="s2">seeing a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">who are pro-racism or pro-sexism or</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.320" end="00:17:47.600" style="s2">pro-you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">pro-transphobia or or any kind of phobia</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.600" end="00:17:51.039" style="s2">or ism</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">and i think that we also fail to</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">just how much progress has been made</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s odd that people don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">people don&#39;t want to recognize that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">live in a very pessimistic it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">pessimistic mindset</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">and a lot of people are just very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">pessimistic and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s weird to me and i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">this also perhaps my perspective on it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.520" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">also stems from my background right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">my family background is originally from</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">nigeria i&#39;ve been to nigeria many times</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">my sort of viewpoint for example if</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">was really</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">was offended by aunt jemima and uncle</p>

<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.919" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">phenomenon i think we&#39;re living in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">moral panic and like i said before an</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">overcorrection</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">i think people uh who have not had the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">opportunity to travel</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">really it&#39;s very hard to talk across</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">that boundary because if you have seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">it elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">then the preposterousness of the claims</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">is transparent and it feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">should be easy to convey but</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">but it&#39;s really it&#39;s really not now</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">i agree with you wholeheartedly even</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">here in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">there is vast agreement on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">racism is bad</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">and that we don&#39;t want a society that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">has those biases built in</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">where conservatives and and progressives</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">tend to disagree</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">is how close to that objective we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">sure so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">but but that&#39;s that&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">disagreement than a question of whether</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">there&#39;s real racism lurking in the minds</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">most whites or even every white as</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">as the mythology would have it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">such a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">an incorrect diagnosis that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">hard to imagine how we get back from it</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">yeah yeah sorry go ahead go ahead there</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.760" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">you go yeah no i was gonna say i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">like i said it&#39;s just um so much of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">stems in pessimism</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">it really it&#39;s really really just such a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">you know i know it&#39;s called critical</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">theory um it&#39;s just such a pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">negative view of humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">individuals and people right the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve met so many i&#39;ve literally</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">met hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">at this point and in different countries</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">you know in 30 something different</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">countries and you learn like you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">most people are decent</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">most people want to get on with life you</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">want to have a career be happy</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">find romance have a family you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">that&#39;s generally what people are about</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">they&#39;re not trying to run around</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">you know harming or or hurting each</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">other if if that were the case then</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:00.080" style="s2">cities cities in general would just be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">nightmare right you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:02.559" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be able to have cities like</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">london and new york where you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.559" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">so much diversity across the whole board</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">you know people would just be</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">maiming each other constantly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case and so and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">also the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">the hysteria it turns</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">away it turns away people who otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">allied in many ways i don&#39;t really like</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">the term ally because it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">it&#39;s been sort of ruined but um yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">turns away people who could be allies so</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">when people say all white people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">racist</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">right or when someone says you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">all you know and this is something i</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">have to be careful with sometimes myself</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">you know i&#39;m i&#39;m no fan of sort of you</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">a lot of the social justice stuff but i</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">myself have to be careful sometimes to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">try not to paint with too</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">broad a brush on that side just like i</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.039" style="s2">don&#39;t want someone to say like</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">oh all conservatives are x or all</p>

<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">issues there is i think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">on the on the left side of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think people</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">i think you do this very well and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:18.400" style="s2">is something i really admire you for</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">is that i think on that side of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.400" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">spectrum people are less willing to rate</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">and reign in the crazies right like i</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">think most most</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to find like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">conservative who is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">defensive of the real alt-right</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">like no this is the line</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">and we&#39;re no nobody was nobody was</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">making excuses for charlottesville right</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">people pretend that wasn&#39;t but nobody</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">everyone was like no this is not bad but</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">if you look at what&#39;s going on with with</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">antifa</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">for example even people in positions of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">power even mayors</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:00.720" style="s2">governors that said nobody wants to eat</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">with them like people don&#39;t want to draw</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">that line</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">and so i think until that happens i kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">of feel like in this whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this culture war as people</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">call it i actually feel like</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">what&#39;s sort of needed in a way is more</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">good and courageous and principled</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">liberals</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">to sort of speak up and be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">draw that line and say</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">okay look this this is going this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">going too far here</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:38.799" style="s2">rather than just sort of staying quiet</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">or sort of tacitly approving of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.799" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">just like i would think you know if on</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">the right side of the spectrum if</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">stuff really did start going far</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">lot of people would be happy to be like</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">okay look like</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">no this is not this is not the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">forward right this type of rhetoric this</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">type of action etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">you know if i mean i don&#39;t know imagine</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">if a group of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">you know right-wing trump supporters</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">created their own autonomous zone</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">in a city and start and started you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">running it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">the reaction would be really different</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">right nobody would the mayor wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">come out and say oh yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s like a block party and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.279" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">just having fun people would be like oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">my gosh this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">this is a fascist takeover like this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.039" style="s2">you know it would be the media response</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">would be different everything would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.039" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">totally different</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">but somehow that can happen or people</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">can be looting buildings and setting</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">places on fire running around in masks</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">beating people up</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">and no one wants to just say this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">and until people can do that i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:44.240" style="s2">we might just this issue might just keep</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">the cowardice on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">people on the left to call out what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">is staggering yeah i i cannot believe it</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">and you&#39;re exactly right i love your</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:02.320" style="s2">yes if if far right wingers</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">declared an autonomous zone i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.320" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">would just be</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">it&#39;d be the end of history would come to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">a halt and we would all be confronting</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">the autonomous zone together but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">somehow coming from the left it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:14.559" style="s2">and did you say that see they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">racial segregation there too</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.559" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">did he say oh of course they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">racism</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">i mean this is the thing when this came</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">to evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">i had my wait what what are you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.000" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">moment and then you know to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">stopped rationalizing that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">happening happening they thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.440" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">and then you know three years later it</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">has now spilled out into</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">you know the whole of the us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">also spilled into</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">europe weirdly which has a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">different racial dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">at least in my opinion i&#39;m actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">one of the things i want to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2">but my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">having done a fair amount of traveling</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">in europe</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">the even the black white dynamic is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">different than we have here in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">have you spent much time in the u.s um a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">decent amount of time i was there for</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">three months last year</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">i went to ten different cities and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">been there a few about six times in</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">total</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">okay so you&#39;ve got recent experience do</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">you also have the sense when you cross</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">the pond</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">that you are engaging a very different</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">interracial dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:27.279" style="s2">um for me personally in my own sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.279" end="00:28:32.399" style="s2">um in the uk in the u.s i had a i had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">great time there and there was no</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.399" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">no issues in that regard um</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">one thing i do certainly observe though</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">based on people i&#39;ve known over the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">years and this goes to you know when i</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.559" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">lived in saudi arabia even</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">you know there were lots of american</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">families living there you know white</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">american families black american</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">families asian american etc</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">and so there i always noticed even from</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">a relatively young age that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">difference in the mindset and the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.919" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">that people would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">you know any type of racial issue and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">how people would sort of view things</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">and i see it i see it online right i</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">spend a lot of time on social media</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">i talk to a lot of people and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">mentality</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">is certain difference is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">different and even the terminology is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">different i think it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">in the in the usa you know you guys say</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">black american african-american latino</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">white american etc here we just say</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">british</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">right there you go so it&#39;s not common to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">hear that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">this person is white british or this</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">person is a black brit</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">you know like sometimes sometimes you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">hear it but it&#39;s quite uncommon</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">regardless of someone&#39;s ethnic origin</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">people just say british and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">in america</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">you know this might seem like a small</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">thing but i think that it&#39;s quite a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">example of just the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">the different type of thinking or even</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">when it comes to politics you hear terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">the black vote right the white vote the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of people are more grouped</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">into blocks in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">yeah sure there are certain trends and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">patterns in the voting</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">but you wouldn&#39;t hear politicians or</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">people in the media or etc talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">the black vote in the uk or</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">and i understand there are historical</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">reasons for that there are demographic</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">reasons for that you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">black people are much smaller pop uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">percentage of the population here in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:26.880" style="s2">uk etc</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">but i think from a from a unity</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.880" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">and from the idea of moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">various forms of identitarianism i feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">as long as people speak in these terms</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">then it&#39;s likely to sort of keep people</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">thinking that way because it does make</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">people think like okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">you know there&#39;s black americans and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">there&#39;s white americans and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">by using those labels i think it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">keeps people</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">locked in that way of thinking and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">think there are i think there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">of people who want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">who want to be locked in that way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">thinking but i think that there are also</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">a lot of people who don&#39;t and just feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">we&#39;re over this you know we have eyes we</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">can see what people look like</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">that&#39;s cool that&#39;s interesting but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">not the ultimate defining</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">characteristic of a person</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">so i think some of it goes back to what</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">you were saying about pessimism</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">and i must say the tenor of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">conversation has changed</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">radically in the last decade and one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">that i suspect is behind the uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">the change is that there&#39;s almost a loss</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">of confidence that true equality</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">can be achieved which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">absolutely tragic because</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">i i i effectively know that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">right having traveled having spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:48.799" style="s2">of time with students of different</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any barrier to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">it but</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">people seem to have responded to um</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">a kind of evidence that i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">they know how to interpret because</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">frankly it it requires an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">of human biology</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:09.600" style="s2">that almost nobody has so i was just</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">talking to coleman hughes about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.600" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">that i think people are drawing a false</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">conclusion from what they see in sport</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">right we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">very different uh capacity to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">different sports</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">based on race or what we would call race</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.840" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">based on population of origin and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">it&#39;s hard-coded right there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">that ethiopians and kenyans dominate</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">marathon running</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">for example right and so i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">an expectation</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">that that has an implication for</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">cognitive stuff that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have because human cognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">functions on a whole different basis</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s basically software</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">and i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">the move to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">hard code some kind of positive racism</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">into this into the very fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">society is a response</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">to a private belief that nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">will work</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">and you know i feel like one of the lone</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">voices just shouting don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">that because actually you can achieve</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">real equality and it does look like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:18.640" style="s2">country in which you don&#39;t refer to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">somebody as a black brit you refer to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.640" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">them as a brit</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">right yeah we can get there but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">requires that we address the software</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">layer carefully and properly which we</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">i think it&#39;s also tricky because people</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">have different definitions</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">of many words including equality of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">course including</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">racism including fairness including all</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">of these terms that we use you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">when someone says diversity to me that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just mean having a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:48.799" style="s2">have different skin colors and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">different sexualities and genders</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.799" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">but who are all in lockstep on thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">when i think of diversity i think of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.960" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">across the board i think of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">ideologically the way people think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">you know people&#39;s character etc that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a whole picture when i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">of equality i think very much of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.039" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">equality of opportunity and i even</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">equality of opportunity is also</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">not totally achievable right i think you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2">can have equality under the law</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">equality and policy equality</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">in the system as much as you can but</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">as we&#39;ve as you&#39;ve already alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">you&#39;re still going to get very disparate</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">outcomes because not everything can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">controlled and there are millions of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">millions of factors</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">that make us all different you can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">this even just within a family right</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the same parents</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve raised in the same household in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">the same place etc</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">and all of the children go off and do</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">totally different things they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:50.159" style="s2">different interests different</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">personalities</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.159" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">their earnings might be massively</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">different from each other all of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">things are just totally different so</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:35:01.359" style="s2">to expect that any kind of equality of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">outcome across like a group or a whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.359" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">population to me is just sort of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:07.599" style="s2">and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">equality of outcome as we sort of know</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.599" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">this already through history it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">dangerous idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s also an idea that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">unachievable</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">and the only way you could achieve it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">just by like raising everybody down</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">right because right there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">you know you people have different</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">intellectual capability people have</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">different interests etc</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">so and people do this in in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">weird places um</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">i mean even if you look at something</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:37.920" style="s2">like the push</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">for gender equity gender parity</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.920" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">you know 50 50 across the board and lots</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">of different things</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">um that firstly it&#39;s funny because they</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:47.359" style="s2">only ever push for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">in certain types of jobs and in other</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">ones they&#39;re totally happy for men to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">100 of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">but also it&#39;s just it it totally denies</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">as you said biological reality it denies</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">people&#39;s freedom of choice</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">it denies the fact that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">are different and people have different</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">interests etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">i mean i i see this myself because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">in the world of music</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">and over here in the uk for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.920" style="s2">there are certain schemes in place in</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">the uk music industry to try to make</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.920" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">um the majority of uk festivals music</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">festivals</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">to have 50 50 gender split on the lineup</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">okay i&#39;m a rapper right my</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">genre of music there are 20 there are 30</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">male rappers</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">for every female rapper and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">because women are not</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">allowed to rap right it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how it is it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">that males are more interested</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">in rapping and that&#39;s okay to me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">like okay as long as women are</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.240" style="s2">unfairly etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">then to me i&#39;m like okay that&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">you can do right that&#39;s the best you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">we can&#39;t start forcing we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">start discriminating against the men and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">and this does happen i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">there was a music festival i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">apply to and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">essentially on the form it basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">said that if you&#39;re a male</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">you&#39;re probably not going to get it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">because they&#39;re trying to get gender</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">parodies so it&#39;s like oh interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">you know i now can&#39;t get this</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">opportunity because</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">i&#39;m male isn&#39;t that sexism and um</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know it just seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">lot of people don&#39;t don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">these things through very well so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">sort of it sounds good on the tin just</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">to say we want 50 50</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">gender equality on the lineup right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">people cheer and everyone&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">but very few people are going wait hang</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">this first firstly why do you want that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">like why is that super important</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">and then secondly how can you even</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">achieve this</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">if you if you&#39;ve got 90 10 on the inputs</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:52.960" style="s2">how are you going to get 50 50</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">on the outputs without some serious</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.960" end="00:37:56.960" style="s2">discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">going on in the middle and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.960" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">only way that it can even be done</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:03.760" style="s2">it is the only way so uh i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked about this anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.760" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">during the evergreen meltdown like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">week in which things went</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">completely haywire my students were</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:14.240" style="s2">watching this happen and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">students who protested were not people i</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.240" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">even knew</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">not only were they not my students i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">never met them okay my own students</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">remained</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:24.480" style="s2">loyal throughout and this one young</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">woman in my class</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.480" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">kept uh approaching me and saying you</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">have to read this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">thing and i&#39;m like look there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">going on i don&#39;t have time to read it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">she&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">you have to read this is a young black</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">woman</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">and at some point she had been so</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">adamant that it was really important</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">that i read this right now that i</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">actually carved out the time and i sat</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">down it was a story harrison bergeron</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">by kurt vonnegut have you read it i</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t read it i&#39;ve heard of it but i</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">haven&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.440" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">you got to read it she was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">right and it makes your exact point</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">which is there is a way to achieve true</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">equality of outcome and it&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">hobbling everybody who is above the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">minimum</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s this dystopian vision</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:11.200" style="s2">a world in which every capacity you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">is interfered with to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">make it equal with everybody else and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a very it makes your point uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">and it is correct so yes quality of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">outcome</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">is not desirable if you attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:29.040" style="s2">create it you will</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">create a dystopian nightmare and</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.040" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">equality of opportunity isn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">achievable either as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">but what you can do the thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">would advocate</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.280" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">is that we would we should want to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">as close to a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">bad luck is randomly distributed with</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">respect to things like</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">race and sex right so the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">point is we can&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">going to be equally</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">capable or have equal access but what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be able to do is say look</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">if you&#39;re black in the u.s we know</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to be able to access</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">the market nearly as effectively as this</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">other population</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">because that&#39;s not luck right yeah bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">luck that&#39;s not randomly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:09.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t luck it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">and we have a lot of that mostly it</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have anything to do with modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">racism</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">it has to do with the echoes of past</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">racism and a system that simply</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">perpetuates current patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">distribution into the future and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">amplifies them</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">so in some sense i think this is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">explanation for what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">is there&#39;s a there&#39;s a correct sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">that things</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">are not functional and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:38.160" style="s2">they are in they are rigged and that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">way they are rigged is not evenly some</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">populations suffer more from the way the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">system is rigged than others</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">but the diagnosis of how the rigging</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">works and what it&#39;s based in and what</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">the remedies are</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">is pure nonsense yeah what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">are are some of the remedies to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">point that could be done</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:58.480" style="s2">without making things worse or without</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.680" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:03.760" style="s2">heavy discrimination against</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:04.800" style="s2">other people because at the moment in</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.760" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">proposed solutions that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">primarily</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">what i see like i can understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">especially in especially in the usa</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">right i don&#39;t think anyone again i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">think anyone disagrees</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">that you know the there&#39;s there are some</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">aftershock effects</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">from the legacy of things like slavery</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">jim crow</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">you know redlining certain welfare</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">policies etc</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:31.680" style="s2">i think that that is you know how how</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">much of that what percentage of that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">i think a lot of people would disagree</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">on but</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">i think most people you know will will</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.520" style="s2">recognize that but i</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">guess the question is what can be done</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.520" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">to rectify that without just</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">you know stamping on everybody else or</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">instituting prejudiced or discriminatory</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">policies what do you think well</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">unfortunately the answer</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">is upstream of all of the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">that people can see</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">so i do think we more or less know where</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">the problem is and what to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">but the answer doesn&#39;t it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">dodge</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:15.680" style="s2">okay so what i would argue is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a cascade of consequences</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.680" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">come from what i would call opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">hoarding</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">that in the u.s in particular but really</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">throughout the west there is a process</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">that allows people who have gained</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">wealth and therefore political power</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:32.240" style="s2">those two things shouldn&#39;t be synonymous</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">but they turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.240" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">once you have that kind of power it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">that um you will get the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">strategies to prevent competitors from</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">rising up and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">uh displacing you so this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">the bad side of conservatism and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">believe me i recognize that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">very positive side to conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">in fact i say i want to live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">so good that i get to be a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">but what happens is mechanisms to block</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">competitors evolve they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">necessarily conscious</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">but they serve to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">to preserve the distribution of of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">and the result of that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">that there is artificial scarcity at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">levels below</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">so the disparity in wealth that we see</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">which people find so shocking</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:28.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t really a problem it&#39;s a symptom of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">a problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.480" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s a symptom of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">that opportunity has been</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">concentrated in one stratum and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">although you can defend a disparity in</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.359" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">wealth i&#39;ve never heard a good defense</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">of a disparity in opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">it&#39;s simply not desirable from the point</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">of view of any of the things we claim to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">be trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">to maximize so if opportunity is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">broadly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a question of who will have</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:58.079" style="s2">access to it and there&#39;s effectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">uh a ladder and those of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.079" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">in the middle of the ladder find we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">but we&#39;re actually in a kind of jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many hungry people</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">on the run just below right so in other</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">words if you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">a job and it uh you know pays your</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">mortgage and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">gives you a retirement plan and medical</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">care and all those things</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">well you may be doing just fine on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">other hand if something</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">turns around and your relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">your employer goes south</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">you can lose all of those things very</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">quickly so</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:32.079" style="s2">the hunger at the bottom as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">extreme scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.079" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">results in a depression of everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">wages for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">because you&#39;re not in a position to uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">to negotiate for more if there are many</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">people who could take your job and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">would willingly do so and at the very</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:48.839" style="s2">bottom of the ladder</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2">what you have is no opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.839" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">whatsoever now that&#39;s no guarantee of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.040" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">who will be there</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">but to the extent that opportunity is</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">racially not evenly distributed you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">a population that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">experiences extremely high unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">which of course is going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">direct</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">relationship with the tendency toward</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">criminality because</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">nobody wants to go to prison but if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have legitimate opportunities you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">will consider</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">things that put you at higher risk</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">and then you get into the really</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:21.680" style="s2">interesting downstream effects</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">so let&#39;s say in the black community</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">you have a very high rate of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">incarceration of men</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">as a result of criminality that i would</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">claim has some relationship</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">to a lack of opportunity once you take</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">men off the table you create a problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">for women</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">in mating and dating because their</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">bargaining position</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">is eroded because men are in such high</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:44.720" style="s2">demand</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:46.079" style="s2">and men who are in high sexual demand</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.720" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">are hard to pin down</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.079" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">for a monogamous relationship so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">results in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">single mothers which results in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">kids who don&#39;t have dads and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">a role a male role model which results</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">breakdown in culture so that&#39;s a vicious</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:06.079" style="s2">cycle</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:08.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s rooted in essentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.079" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">political corruption of various kinds</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.079" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">that concentrates</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">opportunity so i would say if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">dealing with anything downstream of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:16.000" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with a symptom which</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.000" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have a remedy but</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:20.319" style="s2">probably it&#39;s not going to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">good remedy if you don&#39;t deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.319" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">top level</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">problem and so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">second thing is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">you may have had a very different</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">experience in school than i did</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:37.359" style="s2">but um i i did not do well in school</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:40.640" style="s2">ever</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">and um when i ended up teaching i ended</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">up having to teach in a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">that was very different from what normal</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">teaching would look like because</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">even just morally speaking i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">live with myself</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">holding students to standards that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have met</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">right so i had to teach in a different</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">way this has resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">my understanding that the whole school</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">is not really conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">generating high quality thinkers it has</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">a different purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">so the reason i mention it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">one of the things that we have to remedy</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.760" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">is the way we deliver</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">school the way we deliver the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">enhances the the mind&#39;s ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">but if you say well let&#39;s just equalize</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">the schools</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">in the bad neighborhoods to the ones in</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">the good neighborhoods you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">failed because the ones in the good</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">neighborhoods aren&#39;t great either</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">right they&#39;re they&#39;re better at getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">you to succeed in society but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">not really</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">great at creating high quality thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:42.880" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">so uh that&#39;s a very long-winded answer</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.880" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">basically i would say the problems are</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">actually upstream</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">and addressing them is a paramount</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">concern and really what we should seek</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">to do is generate</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">the kinds of developmental environments</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:48:02.800" style="s2">that tend to neutralize the uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">bad luck that is so unevenly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.800" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">yeah yeah i know i i i you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">why i just like talking to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">intelligent smart people across the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">board because this is what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">i think this is what&#39;s necessary because</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">you know conversations like this are</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.760" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">important because</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">i i feel like seems like the diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">right or it&#39;s or people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">because of people&#39;s political biases and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">perhaps political aspirations even</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">and maybe even just a degree of um</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">wanting to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">wanting to win and wanting to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">stick it to the other side</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">is you get a lot of people who think</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">they just go all the way on one thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.440" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">right so if you&#39;re looking at this kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">of issue</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:47.680" style="s2">there are going to be hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">different factors</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.680" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">that play into something i mean if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna look at two</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:55.040" style="s2">big sort of spheres you can put these in</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">of course you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:49:01.359" style="s2">you have sort of issues in</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">the system or the environment</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.359" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">and then you have the individual</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:09.760" style="s2">responsibility and individual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">and perhaps cultural elements and i</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.760" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">conservatives tend to very much focus on</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">the latter including myself right tend</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">to focus a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">on the individual responsibility angle</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.640" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">and you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the society and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:27.200" style="s2">culture and people&#39;s personal choices</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">and behavior etc</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.200" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">people more on the left side of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">spectrum tend to focus more on</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">issues in the system and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">the system and policies and things like</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">the reality is there&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:43.839" style="s2">be aspects of both</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">right like how much weight you put on</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.839" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">one is going to vary from</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">from person to person but the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s like people don&#39;t want to admit</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">this truth</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">which is that there are things on both</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">which can be improved so i&#39;ve spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">some people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">they almost they it&#39;s like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">even believe that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">the capacity to make choices and to like</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">you know choose their own behavior etc</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">which is like look i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t buy that and sometimes i can</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">find it quite offensive if i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">someone who&#39;s telling me that</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:19.359" style="s2">sometimes it can almost like suggest</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:20.640" style="s2">that i&#39;ve heard i&#39;ve heard people</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.359" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">talking i i think i know</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.640" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">i know they don&#39;t mean it this way but</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">the way they talk almost suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">like almost like black people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">like they make an excuse for</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">all bad behavior to the degree i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">what do you not think that people have</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">agency and can make choices and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not clearly</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">most people aren&#39;t behaving in this way</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">so you can&#39;t just like we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">standards for people you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">behavioral standards you can&#39;t just make</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">an excuse for every</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">every bad behavior that someone is</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:53.200" style="s2">and yes i understand that depending on</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.599" end="00:50:56.240" style="s2">someone&#39;s environment</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.200" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">and their family etc that that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">to have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">impact on their likelihood to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:02.319" style="s2">certain behavior so i&#39;m not here like oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">yeah i want to keep people</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.319" end="00:51:07.680" style="s2">stuck in a crap situation like no</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely not but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.680" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">i think you raise people up by actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">holding people to those equal</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">standards and not saying oh okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">sure you murdered somebody</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">but you know your dad wasn&#39;t there so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">we&#39;re going to kind of make and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:25.680" style="s2">like no no no like we need to raise</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">everybody up to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.680" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">standard and then you know you can do</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">both at the same time right you can you</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">can try to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">improve all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">simultaneously right if there are</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">like and again even when it comes to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">know people being more conservative like</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:43.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there are</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">there aren&#39;t a lot of people who if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">can identify clearly</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">right like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not handy when</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">people sort of scream systemic racism</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">and scream institutional racism without</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">telling you</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">what institution or what structure or</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">what system</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">specifically and what should be done</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">like a lot of people sort of use these</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">phrases and think it just sort of ends</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">the argument and i&#39;m kind of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">let&#39;s go deep on that like tell me what</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">what are you talking about because we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">can&#39;t change history</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">right we we know history is immutable so</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">like what can we do now</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:15.920" style="s2">like what are you proposing and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">people don&#39;t really think past that</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.920" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">they just want to say systemic racism</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">and boom they think that&#39;s it it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:23.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">no like you got to tell me tell me what</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.280" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about because</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">if you can and if you can point</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">something out i will</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:31.680" style="s2">i will agree with you like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">factual i&#39;ll be like oh okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:35.200" style="s2">interesting okay i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t aware of that okay what can we</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.200" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">do there</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">to even it out or to make that more fair</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">right some people point out for example</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">an example a lot of people use is that i</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">think this has been maybe done in here</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">in the uk and in the us i don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">numbers and stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:51.680" style="s2">there are for example i know there have</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">been studies so in showing that people</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.680" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">with certain types of names</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">on applications might you know all other</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:52:59.359" style="s2">things being equal they might not</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">you know they might be less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">get a call back after an interview or to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">get an interview in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">and if that&#39;s the case there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">simple solution to that like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not super complicated i&#39;m not i</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">have no issue like if you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">take people&#39;s names off i&#39;m like cool do</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">it like if that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">if that makes it more fair do it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s also weird because now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:19.839" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">i saw just the other day for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.839" end="00:53:23.440" style="s2">with um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">some orchestra they were saying that</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.440" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">they want to end the blind auditions and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">so this is where i get confused because</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:32.480" style="s2">i&#39;m like wait</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">i thought that that was being done to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.480" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">prevent</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">that so this is where it just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:38.240" style="s2">gets confused</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">confusing to me because i&#39;m like gosh</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.240" end="00:53:41.760" style="s2">like what are people</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">i thought we were all aiming towards the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.760" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">same thing but maybe you were</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">not so i kind of i don&#39;t know yeah we we</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">were aiming toward the same thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">now we&#39;re not but yeah look i think the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">the deal is relatively simple to state</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">how we get there is more complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.559" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">i think this is the deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">a if there&#39;s surplus</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">then there must be enough to go around</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:09.839" style="s2">in other words if we&#39;re really in</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">surplus and we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.839" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">then it should not be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a bottom of the ladder that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">have to fall off of that somebody has to</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">fall off of so we have to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">that there is enough and if there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:23.920" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">then we have to make sure that access to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.920" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">it is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:28.880" style="s2">biased and if there is enough and access</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">to it is not biased</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.880" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">you have an absolute obligation as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">individual to try</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">right you have to do your part so this</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">personal responsibility thing that is so</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">heavily infused into the conservative</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">ethos i think is right</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">but it&#39;s not right alone right</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">in a situation in which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">artificial scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">personal responsibility will decrease</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">the chances that you fall off the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s your it&#39;s your best bet but it</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean somebody won&#39;t fall off the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.000" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">bottom</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">so society has to take care of that part</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">and then you have to take care of your</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">yeah and if those two things happen</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">actually we can return</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">to where we were headed which was yes a</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">colorblind society</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">in which it&#39;s not going to ever be</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">perfectly even but</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">nonetheless we can get to a highly</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">desirable state</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">where the degree to which we fall short</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:23.680" style="s2">of our objectives</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:25.359" style="s2">is minor yeah we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">yeah no i think another tricky thing as</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.359" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">well is um you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:32.799" style="s2">what what mechanism is the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:34.559" style="s2">to to do that with i mean i&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.799" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">like when i when i did go to the states</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.559" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">last year</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.839" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">especially when i was in a when i was in</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">los angeles in san francisco i&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:43.200" style="s2">been to those</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">cities before and i was stunned by some</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.200" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">of the stuff i saw</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">right so the level the the homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">the drug use public drug use</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:54.960" style="s2">like i had i&#39;ve been all over the uk</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">and there is nothing in the uk even</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.960" end="00:55:58.400" style="s2">close to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">and i was like whoa this is right i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.400" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">hurt i&#39;d heard things i know this is an</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">issue in places like you know portland</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">seattle et cetera but like</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">i was just seeing things where i was</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">just like oh my goodness what on earth</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2">is going on and it&#39;s even more bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:11.760" style="s2">because i realize i&#39;m in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">i&#39;m in one of the most expensive cities</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.760" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">in the uk in the sorry in the usa</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">and the whole world and i also know that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">you know if i&#39;m in california this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:23.920" style="s2">most highly taxed state</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">so in terms of what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.920" end="00:56:27.680" style="s2">i guess with me part of the reason why i</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.680" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">i lean more libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.680" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">in many ways is because i&#39;m like man</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">the government is clearly not interested</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">solving some of the and solving some of</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">these problems right like because people</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">have been throwing money at it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">like you know i don&#39;t know all of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">ins and outs but</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">you know there there&#39;s the money and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">there&#39;s supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">i&#39;m just like man like there&#39;s a i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:54.680" style="s2">know i think i almost start to look at</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">it on a deeper level and just think like</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.680" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">as human beings maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:02.559" style="s2">you know like i don&#39;t know if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">know if the maybe the government can</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.559" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">solve this but if they can they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">many many decades</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">and you know progress has been made in</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">some areas</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:11.760" style="s2">but in some things you know it looks</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">like if i look at the numbers and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.760" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">stats it&#39;s like ooh that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:14.960" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">worse or you&#39;re out there and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.960" end="00:57:20.720" style="s2">sort of seeing it with your own eyes</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">and yeah i don&#39;t know it&#39;s um it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.720" end="00:57:25.599" style="s2">complicated it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:27.440" style="s2">complicated but i think a lot of it also</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.599" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">i think what&#39;s necessary and i feel this</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.440" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">i feel this for for all countries but i</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">think especially for the usa</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">i think there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">how would i put it i think people need</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.480" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">to sort of really recognize</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">their their commonality i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">there&#39;s so much focus in all these</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">angles there&#39;s so much focus on</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">differences right whether that&#39;s racial</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">or gender or flipping sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">or you know red and blue and this and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">that and there&#39;s not a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:03.760" style="s2">okay like we&#39;re all we&#39;re all americans</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:04.960" style="s2">and look there&#39;s gonna be differences</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be this and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">but we all need to look out for each</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.760" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">in certain ways and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">that oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:16.319" style="s2">um you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:17.839" style="s2">a lot of people have plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.319" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">criticisms about somewhere like saudi</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.839" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">arabia and lots of them are valid</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:25.280" style="s2">but you don&#39;t see homeless people</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">right nobody&#39;s no no nobody&#39;s homeless</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.280" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">there there&#39;s that sort of community</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:34.000" style="s2">spirit and even based on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:34.559" style="s2">you know everyone is religious everyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.000" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.559" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">pretty much everybody you know 99.9 of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:39.839" style="s2">people are muslims so</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">they can&#39;t let their fellow saudi or</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.839" end="00:58:44.559" style="s2">their fellow muslim or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">like be out there on the street so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">level of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:49.599" style="s2">charitability not just in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.680" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">financial giving directly but</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.599" end="00:58:53.119" style="s2">that sort of community cohesion is</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:56.319" style="s2">actually a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">lot better over there so i think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.319" end="00:59:00.079" style="s2">of what makes america</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">awesome is the rugged individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.079" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">entrepreneurship and is all of that but</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">i think when people get</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">so atomized that they can kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:12.559" style="s2">walking around and</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.359" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">see all of this you know i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.559" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">like people people just in total squalor</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">or addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">opioids or strung out on this or on that</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">get used to it and almost just you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">kind of just get to the point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:25.520" style="s2">like oh yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">welcome to la you know that&#39;s just how</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.520" end="00:59:30.720" style="s2">it is and i&#39;m kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">wow that&#39;s that&#39;s weird and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">i&#39;m just i&#39;ve only got one brain like i</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know what this i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">the solution</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:38.799" style="s2">is there but i think it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">people sort of really need to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.799" end="00:59:43.200" style="s2">think about and look at really deeply</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">and and look beyond the government</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.200" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s easy to just say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">i pay my taxes i&#39;ve done my thing um</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:52.480" style="s2">i think i don&#39;t know what the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:54.640" style="s2">but i think that people really need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.480" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know think about that more</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.640" end="00:59:57.839" style="s2">and think about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="01:00:00.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.839" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">and why are we kind of letting this</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.480" end="01:00:04.319" style="s2">happen because these people are on skid</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:06.000" style="s2">row or in the tenderloin</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.319" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">you know these are these are fellow</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.000" end="01:00:10.160" style="s2">americans some of them might even be</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:11.119" style="s2">military veterans and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.160" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.119" end="01:00:14.319" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s something that really</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">did strike me when i was out there</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.319" end="01:00:17.200" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">it was very visceral and i&#39;m not a super</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.200" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">emotional person but i was just like</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">whoa</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">this is this is weird right i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">seen homelessness in every city i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">been to in the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">but not like this like this is another</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">this is a whole different dimension i</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">was seeing people smoking crack shooting</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">heroin i had never seen that before</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:37.119" style="s2">just in public and i was like this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">not this is not normal this is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.119" end="01:00:41.280" style="s2">acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">and yeah and i was even more alarmed by</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.280" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">the fact that people were sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2">seeing it happen and i felt like i was</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">the only one who was there kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.280" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">oh my gosh like look at what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">here and everyone else is just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">going around their business and i&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:52.799" style="s2">of there like staring at the person</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">smoking crack like</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.799" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">whoa what&#39;s what&#39;s going on here and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">police are sort of parked up the street</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:01:01.119" style="s2">just sort of chilling</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s very strange yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.119" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">uh first of all it has changed radically</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">and i also cannot look away and i feel</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">it is a measure of something that has</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">gone off the rails i mean there was</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:16.799" style="s2">always a problem but it has gotten so</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:19.839" style="s2">much worse and i feel like it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.799" end="01:01:22.400" style="s2">almost a direct measure of a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">failure of compassion that has spread</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.400" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">that our system</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.520" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">you&#39;re right some of the strengths of</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:28.319" style="s2">our system set us up for this</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">you know the rugged individualism and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.319" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">the belief in competition</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">which have very positive outgrowths but</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:36.400" style="s2">there are certain ways in which they</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:37.839" style="s2">just set us up for failure</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.400" end="01:01:39.599" style="s2">and i think you know the homeless</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.839" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">problem in some</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.599" end="01:01:44.240" style="s2">weird way mirrors our failure on covet</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">19.</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.240" end="01:01:51.680" style="s2">that rugged individualism caused us to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:53.680" style="s2">demonize each other over you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.680" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">what protests you were allowed to attend</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.680" end="01:01:58.079" style="s2">and whether you thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:58.880" style="s2">masks were tyranny or you thought you</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.079" end="01:02:02.160" style="s2">know you should</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">wear them to bed or i don&#39;t know um</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.160" end="01:02:05.280" style="s2">so that whole thing resulted in us just</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">simply not</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.280" end="01:02:09.680" style="s2">managing covet 19 at all right we did a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">terrible job</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.680" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">and i think your diagnosis is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:17.440" style="s2">right there was</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">a feeling of camaraderie it was never</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.440" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">complete there was always suspicions and</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">a bit of prejudice but</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re losing the thread yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">and the commonalities are really</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:30.400" style="s2">important because</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.000" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">you know and i i did hope i mean i did</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.400" end="01:02:34.400" style="s2">i&#39;ll be honest when this when this sort</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:36.000" style="s2">of pandemic started you know sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.400" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">nationally and internationally i did</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.000" end="01:02:37.920" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:39.520" style="s2">because i&#39;ve been joking for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.920" end="01:02:40.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of my half jokes that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.520" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2">need a war</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.559" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">right i&#39;ve been sort of saying that for</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">many years because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">a lot of the problems almost seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">problems of excess and people just kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">of being bored and being too comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">so they find all this other nonsense to</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:54.000" style="s2">get obsessed with so i did kind of think</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:56.319" style="s2">like oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.000" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">okay this could be the thing that makes</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.319" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">people you know like a common enemy</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:02.480" style="s2">and then people are just like okay you</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:04.400" style="s2">know let&#39;s let&#39;s drop the nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.480" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">and you know let&#39;s put the arms down and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.400" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">stop the mudslinging</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:09.599" style="s2">and let&#39;s just deal with this thing but</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">the opposite happened and it became very</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.599" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">politicized and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:14.880" style="s2">i&#39;d imagine that a lot of people a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">of extra people died who didn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.880" end="01:03:17.839" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">because of the politicization of this</p>

<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:51.839" style="s2">might want to block it</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.240" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">not because despite the fact it&#39;s going</p>

<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:14.240" style="s2">but they can understand that not</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:16.319" style="s2">everybody who voted for him is</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">a racist or a white supremacist or</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.119" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">that about that</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:24.960" style="s2">whatever and you know the same way the</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:25.680" style="s2">other way around not everyone who voted</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.960" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.680" end="01:07:28.720" style="s2">you know the democrats is wanting to you</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:31.680" style="s2">know</p>

<p begin="01:07:31.680" end="01:07:35.359" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.400" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">and this is obvious and i i think</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.359" end="01:07:37.280" style="s2">fundamentally i think most people know</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.280" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">i think most people know it but it just</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.760" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">gets so</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:43.920" style="s2">it&#39;s get so jacked up i think social</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.240" end="01:07:45.520" style="s2">media makes it worse i think traditional</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.920" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">media makes it worse</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.520" end="01:07:48.079" style="s2">all of this makes it worse but when you</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">actually just sit down and talk to</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.079" end="01:07:52.319" style="s2">people like human beings</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:53.680" style="s2">then you realize oh okay you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.319" end="01:07:54.240" style="s2">we maybe we thought we were that far</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.680" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.240" end="01:07:58.000" style="s2">but actually it&#39;s you know we actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:07:59.359" style="s2">overlap on a lot of things and</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.000" end="01:08:01.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve learned some things from this</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.359" end="01:08:02.319" style="s2">person and maybe that you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.039" end="01:08:03.839" style="s2">shared some views with them and then you</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.319" end="01:08:05.039" style="s2">actually get the you get the whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.839" end="01:08:05.599" style="s2">picture because everyone has their blind</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.039" end="01:08:07.039" style="s2">spots</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.599" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">and you can&#39;t see your own blind spot so</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.039" end="01:08:11.440" style="s2">unless you talk then you</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">you won&#39;t have the whole picture i i</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.440" end="01:08:15.359" style="s2">agree you say</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:17.759" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s probably obvious i think it</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.359" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">should be but it really is</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.759" end="01:08:24.080" style="s2">and um you know i like your</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">your point about the pilot i absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:27.359" style="s2">feel this way and i remember you know i</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.239" end="01:08:42.719" style="s2">done the thing that&#39;s hardest which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.159" end="01:08:44.400" style="s2">to break through the duopoly and be</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.719" end="01:08:45.600" style="s2">elected in spite of their desire that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.400" end="01:08:48.319" style="s2">you not be</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:49.279" style="s2">right if he took the capital that he had</p>

<p begin="01:08:49.279" end="01:08:53.199" style="s2">and directed it at you know pure</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.359" end="01:08:57.920" style="s2">leadership he could have been</p>

<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:02.239" style="s2">how could anybody not be rooting for the</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.239" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">and i do feel like those who voted</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.319" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">against trump were rooting for</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:09.600" style="s2">him to fail in spite of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">what he would be failing at is governing</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.600" end="01:09:14.000" style="s2">their nation like it just doesn&#39;t it</p>

<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:19.359" style="s2">would fail</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.560" end="01:09:20.719" style="s2">but to root against him oh it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.359" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">height of insanity</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.719" end="01:09:25.120" style="s2">and yet that is what the experience of</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:26.880" style="s2">being an american in that period was</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">there were just a lot of people</p>

<p begin="01:10:15.600" end="01:10:20.320" style="s2">are very reactionary right so</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.840" end="01:10:22.560" style="s2">it puts people it puts people on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.320" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">defensive and people start playing</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.560" end="01:10:27.760" style="s2">the game against each other and</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:29.520" style="s2">i i i there&#39;s something i say which is</p>

<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">so when people start there are certain</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.239" end="01:10:40.800" style="s2">weapons i just don&#39;t think people should</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">bring to the party it&#39;s why it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">reason why i&#39;m not a fan of identity</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:46.480" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:49.600" style="s2">because as soon as you start shouting</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.480" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">black power black lives matter only buy</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.600" end="01:10:53.679" style="s2">from black businesses</p>

<p begin="01:10:56.560" end="01:11:00.159" style="s2">saying white power white lives matter</p>

<p begin="01:11:00.159" end="01:11:06.320" style="s2">and now you don&#39;t you know you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:08.239" style="s2">what do you say against that if if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.320" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">perfectly fine and even good this one</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.239" end="01:11:11.920" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">then what is now your argument against</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.920" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">people who are now saying this on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">other side of things</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.920" end="01:11:19.280" style="s2">is this is this the weapon you want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">bring to the party</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:23.600" style="s2">and i i think not and not everyone seems</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">to understand that i just think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.600" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">very myopic i think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:28.320" style="s2">short-sighted view</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:30.400" style="s2">of the way to do things or even you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.320" end="01:11:31.920" style="s2">higher up level higher up levels in</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.400" end="01:11:33.440" style="s2">politics and um</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.920" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">you know i think something that you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.440" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m more sympathetic towards trump</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:38.560" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:41.280" style="s2">a lot of people are but i think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.560" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no question that he has</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.280" end="01:11:44.400" style="s2">you know he he&#39;s jacked up the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">temperature</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.400" end="01:11:48.960" style="s2">many times where actually it would have</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">been good to bring down the temperature</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.960" end="01:11:53.360" style="s2">a great example would be you know during</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">some aspects of this pandemic during</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.360" end="01:11:56.000" style="s2">some of the you know when the</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:11:57.360" style="s2">demonstrations are going on and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.000" end="01:11:59.360" style="s2">riots and this</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.360" end="01:12:01.600" style="s2">i thought actually he&#39;s had a great</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.360" end="01:12:03.679" style="s2">potential opportunity to sort of step up</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.600" end="01:12:05.440" style="s2">and take the wind out of the sails</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.679" end="01:12:07.120" style="s2">of his opponents and the media and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.440" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">people who want to constantly</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.120" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">berate him you know stop giving them</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:12.719" style="s2">ammo right don&#39;t don&#39;t go on and say</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.600" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">you know when the looting starts the</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.719" end="01:12:16.400" style="s2">shooting starts like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.960" end="01:12:18.080" style="s2">right it just jacks up the temperature</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.400" end="01:12:20.239" style="s2">it makes people more</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.080" end="01:12:21.600" style="s2">more divisive more hostile etc i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.239" end="01:12:23.280" style="s2">okay look this is the time</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:24.400" style="s2">and and that&#39;s probably one of his</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.280" end="01:12:26.000" style="s2">strengths right one of his strengths is</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.400" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">that he fights fire with fire and people</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.000" end="01:12:28.080" style="s2">love that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">so if the media is talking crap he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.080" end="01:12:32.159" style="s2">come and he&#39;ll talk crap about the media</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:34.159" style="s2">and people like that and people cheer</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.159" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">but sometimes you need to know when to</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.159" end="01:12:39.679" style="s2">be like</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:43.600" style="s2">okay let me swallow a bit of pride</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.679" end="01:12:45.600" style="s2">and just calm things down a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.600" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">and i think by him doing that as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.600" end="01:12:48.840" style="s2">leader</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:51.120" style="s2">i do think to some degree it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.840" end="01:12:53.440" style="s2">encouraged other</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.120" end="01:12:54.960" style="s2">politicians and other people to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.440" end="01:12:57.520" style="s2">play that same</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.960" end="01:12:58.159" style="s2">game i mean if you you you spend time on</p>

<p begin="01:13:38.719" end="01:13:44.880" style="s2">is that he cannot view any issue</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.080" end="01:13:46.880" style="s2">in non-political terms and i consider it</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:49.840" style="s2">absolutely unpatriotic</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.880" end="01:13:52.159" style="s2">um which is a weird thing to say but um</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.840" end="01:13:53.199" style="s2">but nonetheless it it&#39;s a tragic failure</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.159" end="01:13:56.320" style="s2">on his part</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.199" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s the downside to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.320" end="01:13:59.920" style="s2">thing that did allow him</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:01.600" style="s2">to break through the duopoly right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.920" end="01:14:04.560" style="s2">he is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:06.320" style="s2">brilliant political strategist and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.560" end="01:14:09.920" style="s2">political strategist just</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.320" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">can&#39;t can&#39;t be silent so that he can</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.920" end="01:14:12.640" style="s2">lead</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:14.480" style="s2">so he doesn&#39;t lead he politicizes and</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.640" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">it&#39;s very dangerous and then to your</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.480" end="01:14:20.719" style="s2">other point</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:22.920" style="s2">the um emerging black identitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.719" end="01:14:24.880" style="s2">is inevitably going to create white</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.920" end="01:14:26.560" style="s2">identitarianism it actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.880" end="01:14:28.400" style="s2">legitimizes it because if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.560" end="01:14:30.560" style="s2">to divide us into those teams</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.400" end="01:14:32.000" style="s2">then you can&#39;t very well expect people</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.560" end="01:14:35.040" style="s2">not to play</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.000" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">on a team yeah so yeah if we&#39;re to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.040" end="01:14:38.640" style="s2">that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:40.480" style="s2">we have to shift out of this mode of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.640" end="01:14:41.679" style="s2">imagining that that&#39;s a solution because</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.480" end="01:14:43.120" style="s2">it&#39;s going to result</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.679" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">i mean i really think it&#39;s going to tear</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.120" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">the us apart and</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">um as likely if biden is elected as if</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:53.520" style="s2">trump remains in office</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:53.840" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah i think people just there</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.520" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.840" end="01:14:58.320" style="s2">certain games i think you win by just</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:59.600" style="s2">not playing all right just don&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.320" end="01:15:01.520" style="s2">just don&#39;t play that game don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.600" end="01:15:02.719" style="s2">dragged into this thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.520" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">it&#39;s something i experience right i</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.719" end="01:15:06.000" style="s2">always feel like i&#39;ve often got people</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.560" end="01:15:08.560" style="s2">especially nowadays you know trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.000" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">drag trying to drag me into things that</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.560" end="01:15:12.000" style="s2">i&#39;m just not</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.760" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">like i&#39;m just like no i don&#39;t wanna i</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.000" end="01:15:14.719" style="s2">don&#39;t wanna get in i don&#39;t wanna get</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.360" end="01:15:15.760" style="s2">involved with this thing i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.719" end="01:15:17.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.760" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.520" end="01:15:22.960" style="s2">think it i don&#39;t think it helps like</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:24.640" style="s2">my my worldview is really really simple</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.960" end="01:15:26.000" style="s2">when it comes to stuff like this and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.640" end="01:15:26.960" style="s2">is you know it is the martin luther king</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.000" end="01:15:28.960" style="s2">jr</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.960" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">vision and you know the way i was raised</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.960" end="01:15:32.800" style="s2">from from when i was a child</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:34.640" style="s2">you know growing up in saudi arabia from</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.800" end="01:15:34.960" style="s2">from the beginning i&#39;ve been surrounded</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.640" end="01:15:36.960" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.960" end="01:15:38.000" style="s2">all types of different people different</p>

<p begin="01:15:40.880" end="01:15:46.159" style="s2">just been the norm for me</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.480" end="01:15:49.760" style="s2">forever so the whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.159" end="01:15:51.360" style="s2">idea of viewing people through this very</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.760" end="01:15:53.360" style="s2">narrow lens</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.360" end="01:15:55.199" style="s2">from a child i&#39;ve always thought it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.360" end="01:15:57.920" style="s2">silly and it&#39;s asinine and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.199" end="01:15:59.679" style="s2">it makes me somewhat upset when i sort</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.920" end="01:16:01.199" style="s2">of just see that now like you know day</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.679" end="01:16:03.440" style="s2">in and day out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.199" end="01:16:05.520" style="s2">white this and black that and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.440" end="01:16:08.640" style="s2">like just can we can we</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.520" end="01:16:10.480" style="s2">stop right like so much of this is just</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.640" end="01:16:12.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just unnecessary and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.480" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">antagonizing and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.560" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">and it just forces people to keep</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:17.520" style="s2">viewing</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">the world through that way when there</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.520" end="01:16:21.280" style="s2">are just so many other like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">least interesting</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.280" end="01:16:25.520" style="s2">thing it&#39;s such an uninteresting thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:28.080" style="s2">about someone that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.520" end="01:16:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s i i think the fact that i&#39;m a black</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.080" end="01:16:32.159" style="s2">male</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.880" end="01:16:33.840" style="s2">is one of the least interesting things</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.159" end="01:16:35.679" style="s2">about me it certainly doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.840" end="01:16:37.600" style="s2">anything about my my personality or my</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.679" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">character or my beliefs or my abilities</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.600" end="01:16:41.280" style="s2">or anything</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.560" end="01:16:42.080" style="s2">um it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s sure it&#39;s observable</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.280" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:49.040" style="s2">if someone is talking to me i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.280" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">that to be the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.040" end="01:16:53.040" style="s2">in their head and that they&#39;re obsessing</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.280" end="01:17:03.600" style="s2">all that stuff is is details and um</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:05.280" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s hard i think that but i</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.600" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">think i think what is good</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.280" end="01:17:08.719" style="s2">i think something that&#39;s good is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:10.960" style="s2">there is this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.719" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">i think there is a growing tent of</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.960" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">people who are</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:15.679" style="s2">i guess you know politically sort of in</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:18.800" style="s2">the center left and center right</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.679" end="01:17:22.000" style="s2">who are sort of uniting</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.800" end="01:17:24.239" style="s2">and recognizing okay what what</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.000" end="01:17:26.080" style="s2">these people all have in common is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.239" end="01:17:28.400" style="s2">they&#39;re tired of the extremism</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.080" end="01:17:29.280" style="s2">and they don&#39;t like cancel culture and</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.400" end="01:17:32.719" style="s2">they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.280" end="01:17:34.239" style="s2">you know this super identity politics</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.719" end="01:17:36.719" style="s2">thing on any side</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.239" end="01:17:37.520" style="s2">and they don&#39;t want to destroy the whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.719" end="01:17:39.199" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.520" end="01:17:41.280" style="s2">and they don&#39;t think the country is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.199" end="01:17:42.320" style="s2">terrible and you know like</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.280" end="01:17:44.159" style="s2">i think there&#39;s that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.320" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">growing group of people who i think are</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.159" end="01:17:47.600" style="s2">slowly</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:49.600" style="s2">gaining a bit more and more courage and</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.600" end="01:17:51.520" style="s2">i think that they&#39;re sort of seeing</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.600" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">you know podcasts like this and what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.520" end="01:17:53.440" style="s2">doing with my podcast and you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.960" end="01:17:55.440" style="s2">whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.440" end="01:17:57.600" style="s2">joe rogan or dave rubin etc like all</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.440" end="01:17:58.480" style="s2">these guys they&#39;re sort of seeing okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.600" end="01:18:00.000" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.480" end="01:18:02.239" style="s2">people are talking about this and</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:03.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a range of people here who are</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.239" end="01:18:04.239" style="s2">sensible and don&#39;t want to scream at</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.679" end="01:18:05.760" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.239" end="01:18:07.520" style="s2">and call each other racist every three</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.760" end="01:18:09.040" style="s2">seconds and just</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.520" end="01:18:11.040" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s that growing</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.040" end="01:18:13.360" style="s2">group so i do hope that</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.040" end="01:18:14.880" style="s2">that swells and gains enough sort of</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.360" end="01:18:16.400" style="s2">courage and momentum</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.880" end="01:18:18.159" style="s2">for people to eventually just be like</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.400" end="01:18:20.640" style="s2">okay look like we&#39;re gonna just</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.159" end="01:18:21.600" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna stop entertaining the</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.640" end="01:18:22.960" style="s2">crazies</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.600" end="01:18:25.120" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna stop letting them sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.960" end="01:18:26.800" style="s2">of determine everything</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.120" end="01:18:29.199" style="s2">and set all the rules and control</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.800" end="01:18:31.440" style="s2">everybody and cancel everybody</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.199" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">and i think once enough once there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.440" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">enough critical mass there</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:36.480" style="s2">then i think you can get back to a sort</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:38.880" style="s2">of stage of normal normalcy</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.480" end="01:18:41.040" style="s2">where people are just sort of being like</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.880" end="01:18:42.239" style="s2">reasonable again and we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.040" end="01:18:44.400" style="s2">solve some of the problems because we</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:47.920" style="s2">can talk</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.400" end="01:18:49.120" style="s2">totally agree and i have a uh a weird</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.920" end="01:18:51.600" style="s2">sense about this</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.120" end="01:18:51.600" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.159" end="01:18:55.280" style="s2">i hate to put in monetary terms but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.320" end="01:18:58.480" style="s2">almost like</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.280" end="01:19:00.000" style="s2">everybody is hemorrhaging money and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.480" end="01:19:01.280" style="s2">there&#39;s an easy way to stop but they</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.000" end="01:19:05.120" style="s2">just don&#39;t realize it</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.280" end="01:19:07.040" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve been trying to advise people</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.120" end="01:19:08.560" style="s2">get rid of your prejudice and your</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.040" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">bigotry because it&#39;s like giving</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.560" end="01:19:12.800" style="s2">yourself a huge</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.840" end="01:19:14.080" style="s2">raise right if you have prejudice and</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.800" end="01:19:15.520" style="s2">bigotry and you&#39;re walking down the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.080" end="01:19:17.440" style="s2">street suspicious of people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.520" end="01:19:20.080" style="s2">paying a cost for this thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.440" end="01:19:22.400" style="s2">if you get rid of that right what</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.080" end="01:19:25.280" style="s2">happens is actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:27.199" style="s2">the world becomes much more like the big</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.280" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">barbecue full of people that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.199" end="01:19:29.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.600" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">but you could sit down next to any one</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.600" end="01:19:32.320" style="s2">of them and suddenly a conversation can</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:34.080" style="s2">happen and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.320" end="01:19:35.440" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re not going to agree maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.080" end="01:19:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the best thing that can happen</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.440" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.880" end="01:19:40.320" style="s2">you actually might discover something</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.880" end="01:19:41.280" style="s2">whereas if you agree perfectly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.320" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">nothing to learn</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.280" end="01:19:46.480" style="s2">so for those of us who do this i think</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:49.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.480" end="01:19:51.280" style="s2">very positive sense of camaraderie</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.760" end="01:19:53.600" style="s2">even when people are across an</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.280" end="01:19:56.159" style="s2">ideological line that it&#39;s not personal</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.600" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">and that the conversation will be</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.159" end="01:20:00.239" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:20:01.760" style="s2">when we have it and the the hard part is</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.239" end="01:20:03.679" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.760" end="01:20:04.880" style="s2">getting people to realize that they will</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.679" end="01:20:07.120" style="s2">feel better</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.880" end="01:20:08.560" style="s2">if they just try it out right if they</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.120" end="01:20:08.960" style="s2">just give people the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.560" end="01:20:10.480" style="s2">doubt</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.960" end="01:20:12.480" style="s2">and they don&#39;t leap you know even if</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.480" end="01:20:13.360" style="s2">somebody admits a prejudice and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.480" end="01:20:15.600" style="s2">bad one</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.360" end="01:20:16.639" style="s2">if you can figure out how to cross the</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.600" end="01:20:18.000" style="s2">boundary and</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.639" end="01:20:20.400" style="s2">correct them help them see what they</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.000" end="01:20:24.400" style="s2">don&#39;t see that actually feels good too</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.400" end="01:20:26.159" style="s2">so um you know give yourself a raise is</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.400" end="01:20:28.239" style="s2">kind of the way i think</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.159" end="01:20:30.159" style="s2">uh it needs to be packaged in order for</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.239" end="01:20:32.800" style="s2">people to understand what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.159" end="01:20:34.000" style="s2">yeah i like that and a way i look at it</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.800" end="01:20:35.679" style="s2">as well is that um</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.000" end="01:20:38.320" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve long been a believer that</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.679" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">i can learn something from everybody</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.320" end="01:20:42.480" style="s2">right and that also every stranger is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:45.040" style="s2">potential friend</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.480" end="01:20:46.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s really something it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.040" end="01:20:47.199" style="s2">really helpful actually throughout my</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.080" end="01:20:49.199" style="s2">music as well especially as an</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.199" end="01:20:51.679" style="s2">independent artist that sort of approach</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.199" end="01:20:53.440" style="s2">but part of the reason why that makes</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.679" end="01:20:56.480" style="s2">sense is even from a</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.440" end="01:20:57.679" style="s2">even from a a selfish perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.480" end="01:20:59.520" style="s2">stupid to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.679" end="01:21:01.600" style="s2">prejudiced and discriminatory because</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.520" end="01:21:02.560" style="s2">you&#39;re cutting off so many potential</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.600" end="01:21:05.600" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.560" end="01:21:07.280" style="s2">who could help you or who</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.600" end="01:21:09.440" style="s2">might be friends or who might be you</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.280" end="01:21:10.480" style="s2">know and it&#39;s like why would you want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.440" end="01:21:13.280" style="s2">limit yourself</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.480" end="01:21:13.760" style="s2">so you know you&#39;re handicapping yourself</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.280" end="01:21:17.360" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.760" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">only you know if i only spoke to other</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:20.560" style="s2">christians</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:21.920" style="s2">right and i only associated whether like</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.560" end="01:21:24.320" style="s2">i&#39;m cutting off</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.920" end="01:21:25.600" style="s2">the majority of the world right if i</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.320" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">only associated with</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.600" end="01:21:29.679" style="s2">other black people and i only bought</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:32.159" style="s2">from black businesses and i only</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.679" end="01:21:33.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like what am i doing right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.159" end="01:21:35.040" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these people here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.679" end="01:21:37.199" style="s2">all of these opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.040" end="01:21:39.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m so stuck in my thing with my</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.199" end="01:21:41.760" style="s2">prejudices that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.120" end="01:21:42.960" style="s2">that i can&#39;t engage in all of this other</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.760" end="01:21:44.320" style="s2">stuff and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.960" end="01:21:46.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense and then of course</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.320" end="01:21:48.320" style="s2">from you know from the moral perspective</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.080" end="01:21:49.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;re all we&#39;re all humans you</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.320" end="01:21:51.920" style="s2">know we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.760" end="01:21:53.440" style="s2">we&#39;re all uh you know related in many</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.920" end="01:21:55.600" style="s2">ways and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.440" end="01:21:56.880" style="s2">yeah just treat people decently you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.600" end="01:21:59.040" style="s2">be kind to each other it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.880" end="01:22:00.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not that hard not only is it not</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.040" end="01:22:01.760" style="s2">that hard but</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.080" end="01:22:03.199" style="s2">once you get used to it you&#39;ll love it</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.760" end="01:22:05.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not an hour yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:07.600" style="s2">all right two more things before i let</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.120" end="01:22:10.719" style="s2">you go um</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.600" end="01:22:13.679" style="s2">so i should say like most of my uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.719" end="01:22:16.080" style="s2">listeners i have certainly had the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.679" end="01:22:17.920" style="s2">occasional simultaneous fight with a</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.080" end="01:22:21.679" style="s2">bear and a chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.920" end="01:22:24.480" style="s2">right but your uh wikipedia page says</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.679" end="01:22:26.800" style="s2">that you have fought a bear a chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.480" end="01:22:28.320" style="s2">and a kangaroo simultaneously what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.800" end="01:22:29.840" style="s2">that about</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.320" end="01:22:32.560" style="s2">is that actually on my wikipedia page it</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.840" end="01:22:32.560" style="s2">is on your wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.320" end="01:22:38.159" style="s2">i didn&#39;t even know i had a wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.760" end="01:22:39.199" style="s2">page until this podcast so um you should</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.159" end="01:22:42.159" style="s2">check it out it says all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.199" end="01:22:43.600" style="s2">interesting things oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.159" end="01:22:45.360" style="s2">all right i wasn&#39;t i wasn&#39;t aware of</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:46.320" style="s2">that but um so that yeah this never</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.360" end="01:22:49.360" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.320" end="01:22:50.159" style="s2">um i meant now i now i wish i kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.360" end="01:22:51.920" style="s2">wish it had</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.159" end="01:22:53.280" style="s2">but uh no not yet my guess is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.920" end="01:22:54.239" style="s2">probably just forgetting that it</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.280" end="01:22:55.760" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.239" end="01:22:58.000" style="s2">five minutes after we&#39;re done it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.760" end="01:23:00.800" style="s2">occur to you that that&#39;s a reference to</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.000" end="01:23:02.320" style="s2">all right um last thing and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.800" end="01:23:05.280" style="s2">two-part question</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.320" end="01:23:07.280" style="s2">you said you&#39;ve released five albums uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.280" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">five albums and three eps so</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.280" end="01:23:11.760" style="s2">eight releases in total okay so i wanna</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.440" end="01:23:15.120" style="s2">ask you two questions</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.760" end="01:23:16.880" style="s2">for the person who is a rap</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.120" end="01:23:18.800" style="s2">is it fair to say a rap hip-hop</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.880" end="01:23:20.320" style="s2">aficionado or should i really be</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.800" end="01:23:22.159" style="s2">separating those</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.320" end="01:23:23.679" style="s2">no that&#39;s that&#39;s fine but hip-hop is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.159" end="01:23:27.520" style="s2">culture rap is the music</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.679" end="01:23:30.880" style="s2">okay good so for a rap aficionado</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.520" end="01:23:34.159" style="s2">which of your albums or eps would you</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.880" end="01:23:35.520" style="s2">direct people to the one you&#39;re proudest</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.159" end="01:23:36.400" style="s2">of or you think they should encounter</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.520" end="01:23:37.840" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.400" end="01:23:39.760" style="s2">i would recommend they listen to</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.840" end="01:23:42.560" style="s2">perseverance perseverance</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.760" end="01:23:43.199" style="s2">okay yeah perseverance now a different</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.560" end="01:23:46.480" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.199" end="01:23:50.480" style="s2">for somebody like me who is aware that</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.480" end="01:23:52.480" style="s2">if i had grown up with rap or had found</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.480" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">myself deeply involved in it i would</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.480" end="01:23:55.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.880" end="01:23:56.239" style="s2">how to to wade into those waters but</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.600" end="01:23:59.280" style="s2">having not</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.239" end="01:24:01.280" style="s2">grown up with it it always seems a</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.280" end="01:24:04.560" style="s2">little unmusical to me</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.280" end="01:24:06.800" style="s2">um which of your which of your albums or</p>
