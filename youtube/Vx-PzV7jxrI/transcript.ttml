<p begin="00:00:29.050" end="00:00:35.740" style="s2">Cassie&#39;s films and the reception to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.419" end="00:00:38.770" style="s2">films that you&#39;re both independent</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.740" end="00:00:41.350" style="s2">female directors making films about</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.770" end="00:00:43.570" style="s2">controversial topics and have had sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.350" end="00:00:45.310" style="s2">of mixed responses kind of what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.570" end="00:00:48.850" style="s2">might call a kind of encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.310" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">council culture and and I also find</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.850" end="00:00:51.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of similarities like</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:54.790" style="s2">you&#39;re both from quite a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.370" end="00:00:57.790" style="s2">background and I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.790" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">in in the what the process was of making</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.790" end="00:01:01.300" style="s2">those films whether there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.680" style="s2">similarities I know also in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.300" end="00:01:05.080" style="s2">run-up to this you both watched each</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.680" end="00:01:06.700" style="s2">other&#39;s films again so I&#39;d be really</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.080" end="00:01:08.320" style="s2">interested in any kind of thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.700" end="00:01:11.530" style="s2">reflections that you have on on each</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.320" end="00:01:13.690" style="s2">other&#39;s work as well and but I might</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.530" end="00:01:16.510" style="s2">just ask Cassie if like if I could ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.690" end="00:01:19.120" style="s2">you a few more a few years since the red</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.510" end="00:01:20.830" style="s2">pill movie came out just to recap what</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.120" end="00:01:23.860" style="s2">that experience was like and what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.830" end="00:01:25.479" style="s2">reception was like maybe that see if</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.860" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">there any similarities that Patricia can</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.479" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">pick up on in write of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:34.450" style="s2">yeah sure well first off thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:36.880" style="s2">having me on here David always good to</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.880" end="00:01:43.869" style="s2">meet you remotely definitely a fan of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.049" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">your work and approach and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.869" end="00:01:47.500" style="s2">things that you did that I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:52.390" style="s2">respect for so we can get into that in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.500" end="00:01:53.860" style="s2">this conversation but if people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.390" end="00:01:57.220" style="s2">thinking oh where&#39;s Cass I&#39;ve been for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.860" end="00:01:58.720" style="s2">while I&#39;ve been declining all interviews</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.220" end="00:02:01.689" style="s2">this year pretty much except for one</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.720" end="00:02:03.820" style="s2">back in February but I&#39;ve been laying</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.689" end="00:02:07.000" style="s2">low working on a new project so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.820" end="00:02:10.090" style="s2">where I&#39;ve been but my film the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.000" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">came out let&#39;s see it was released in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.090" end="00:02:16.750" style="s2">theaters October 7th 2018</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:18.520" style="s2">sixteen and the reason I say the date is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.750" end="00:02:22.630" style="s2">because I think it was just one week</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.520" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">over week and a half after Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:28.390" style="s2">Peterson released his professor against</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:30.670" style="s2">political correctness video which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.390" end="00:02:36.970" style="s2">kind of one skyrocketed him into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.670" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">mainstream so for that reason I think my</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.970" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">experience of watching the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:42.190" style="s2">Jordan Peterson was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.780" style="s2">because it was the same timeframe of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.190" end="00:02:45.400" style="s2">when I was starting to get out to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.780" end="00:02:48.100" style="s2">out in the public with the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.400" end="00:02:50.530" style="s2">movie and Jordan Peterson was as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.100" end="00:02:52.600" style="s2">and so I could really relate to him in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.530" end="00:02:57.100" style="s2">the rise of Jordan Peterson as far as</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.600" end="00:02:58.690" style="s2">the blowback that he received and now</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.100" end="00:03:02.230" style="s2">unfortunately I can also relate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.690" end="00:03:05.620" style="s2">Patricia&#39;s experience with blowback but</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.230" end="00:03:07.720" style="s2">I do think that we have a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.620" end="00:03:10.240" style="s2">similarities with her documentaries as</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.720" end="00:03:12.490" style="s2">far as you know I&#39;m Sur the red pill is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.240" end="00:03:14.140" style="s2">certainly more closely related to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.490" end="00:03:15.940" style="s2">rise of Jordan Peterson than it is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.140" end="00:03:18.190" style="s2">you know something about environmental</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.940" end="00:03:20.260" style="s2">issues or a million different</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.190" end="00:03:22.330" style="s2">documentaries that are out there with</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.260" end="00:03:24.580" style="s2">that said I think we also have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.330" end="00:03:26.830" style="s2">differences within our documentaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.580" end="00:03:28.300" style="s2">which is great because I love to see the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.830" end="00:03:30.850" style="s2">various ways that documentaries can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.300" end="00:03:35.080" style="s2">made one main difference is that the red</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.850" end="00:03:37.720" style="s2">pill movie was a first-person account of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.080" end="00:03:39.820" style="s2">my story I included myself in the film</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:42.790" style="s2">through video diaries and it was one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.820" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">the last decisions I made and making the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.790" end="00:03:47.950" style="s2">film was to include my own journey of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:49.630" style="s2">making the film so it&#39;s kind of a film</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.950" end="00:03:52.660" style="s2">within a film or a story within a story</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.630" end="00:03:54.430" style="s2">I was making a movie about the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.660" end="00:03:56.680" style="s2">rights activists the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.430" end="00:03:58.600" style="s2">movement and then I also happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.680" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">documenting my experience as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.600" end="00:04:02.170" style="s2">filmmaker making the movie and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:05.739" style="s2">combined the two to make the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.170" end="00:04:07.180" style="s2">movie where as Patricia took a I guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.739" end="00:04:09.190" style="s2">what would be called a cinema vert a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:10.989" style="s2">approach which is a fly on the wall you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.190" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know who the filmmaker is behind</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.989" end="00:04:15.880" style="s2">the camera and it&#39;s this very</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">intellectual you know kind of you feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.880" end="00:04:21.010" style="s2">like you&#39;re sneaking in on private</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.300" style="s2">conversations and it&#39;s just a glimpse</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.010" end="00:04:24.310" style="s2">into the private life with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.300" end="00:04:26.949" style="s2">Peterson which is I think the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:29.889" style="s2">approach for that story</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.949" end="00:04:33.419" style="s2">so yeah we can get more into the details</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.889" end="00:04:34.810" style="s2">but I really enjoyed your film dish&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.419" end="00:04:37.689" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.810" end="00:04:40.569" style="s2">Patricia would you like to sort of pick</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.689" end="00:04:42.490" style="s2">up did you do you do resonate with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.569" end="00:04:45.279" style="s2">I mean you you&#39;ve you&#39;ve quite more</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.490" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">recently had some sort of cinema saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.279" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">that they won&#39;t show it and and did you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:51.279" style="s2">actually have protests or was it most it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:52.810" style="s2">was mostly the staff and the cinemas</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.279" end="00:04:56.319" style="s2">that said that they weren&#39;t comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.810" end="00:05:00.789" style="s2">screening it we didn&#39;t have any protests</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.319" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">but yes we had three cancellations and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.789" end="00:05:07.180" style="s2">we had we had several knows that are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:08.620" style="s2">the the typical kind of knows that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.180" end="00:05:10.659" style="s2">get in the industry when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.620" end="00:05:12.129" style="s2">approaching theaters so we hired a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.659" end="00:05:14.139" style="s2">experienced Booker who&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.129" end="00:05:16.779" style="s2">well-connected in the industry to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.139" end="00:05:20.139" style="s2">cinemas and and he just commented on how</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.779" end="00:05:21.939" style="s2">this wasn&#39;t what was typical because no</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.139" end="00:05:23.650" style="s2">is the expected response in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.939" end="00:05:28.569" style="s2">industry but but this was something</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.650" end="00:05:31.180" style="s2">different and it definitely seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.569" end="00:05:33.490" style="s2">there was more of an ideological reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:35.379" style="s2">behind some of the knows that we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.490" end="00:05:37.060" style="s2">getting some theaters were more Frank</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.379" end="00:05:38.919" style="s2">than others like there was one theater</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.060" end="00:05:42.909" style="s2">that said to us something to the effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.919" end="00:05:46.629" style="s2">of we think this film is interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.909" end="00:05:50.349" style="s2">fair but we don&#39;t want to contribute in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.629" end="00:05:52.930" style="s2">any way to the the cult of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.349" end="00:05:54.759" style="s2">Peterson something to that effect but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.930" end="00:05:58.330" style="s2">at least respect the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.759" end="00:06:00.659" style="s2">theater was honest versus you know some</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.330" end="00:06:03.490" style="s2">theaters that said things like well</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.659" end="00:06:05.740" style="s2">there&#39;s no market viability for this</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.490" end="00:06:07.810" style="s2">film and it&#39;s a film about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.740" end="00:06:09.250" style="s2">Peterson who sold over 3 million books</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.810" end="00:06:12.430" style="s2">around the world so it&#39;s hard to buy</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.250" end="00:06:13.479" style="s2">that argument and something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.430" end="00:06:15.699" style="s2">that&#39;s happening now is I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.479" end="00:06:18.729" style="s2">having a conversation with a theatre</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.699" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">that rejected our film and I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.729" end="00:06:23.979" style="s2">conversation through the letter wiki</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:25.870" style="s2">platform and this is a theatre that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.979" end="00:06:29.889" style="s2">three hours away from Toronto so it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.870" end="00:06:32.050" style="s2">a smaller town and I really respect the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.889" end="00:06:33.819" style="s2">fact that the cinema owner is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.050" end="00:06:36.099" style="s2">engage and talk about this and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.819" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">like she felt a bit unsettled about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.099" end="00:06:40.420" style="s2">decision that she made but also felt</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:42.640" style="s2">like she was kind of between a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.420" end="00:06:45.610" style="s2">in a hard place of not wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.640" end="00:06:48.310" style="s2">compromise her values of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.610" end="00:06:50.980" style="s2">expression and conversation as a former</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.310" end="00:06:54.340" style="s2">librarian yet at the same time she was</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.980" end="00:06:56.170" style="s2">nervous about the kind of pushback she</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.340" end="00:06:58.680" style="s2">would get from people in her own social</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.170" end="00:07:02.830" style="s2">circle if she were to screen the film</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.680" end="00:07:05.320" style="s2">and how it might affect patreon existing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.830" end="00:07:07.570" style="s2">patrons and the reputation of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.320" end="00:07:10.480" style="s2">theater and she actually mentioned your</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.570" end="00:07:12.190" style="s2">film and I just I want to find exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.480" end="00:07:15.190" style="s2">what she said about it because she was</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.190" end="00:07:18.580" style="s2">mentioning any other instances she had</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.190" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">where she&#39;s rejected showing films and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.580" end="00:07:24.730" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of scrolling through here</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:26.740" style="s2">oh yes she said the only other film</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.730" end="00:07:28.360" style="s2">either than the rise of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.740" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">that I&#39;ve refrained from showing because</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.360" end="00:07:32.380" style="s2">I perceived and dreaded potential</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:34.180" style="s2">controversy was the men&#39;s rights doc the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.380" end="00:07:38.380" style="s2">red pill in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.180" end="00:07:41.740" style="s2">oh well well I guess we are in the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.380" end="00:07:43.600" style="s2">camp in you seen the red pill Trisha</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.740" end="00:07:45.220" style="s2">yeah it has been a while since I watched</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.600" end="00:07:48.130" style="s2">I wanted to rewatch it for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.220" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">interview didn&#39;t have the chance um well</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.130" end="00:07:52.600" style="s2">when I first heard about the film it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:54.910" style="s2">in the early stages of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.600" end="00:07:58.120" style="s2">controversy unraveling with Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.910" end="00:08:00.040" style="s2">so I remember being really curious about</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.120" end="00:08:01.510" style="s2">you and being really curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.040" end="00:08:04.150" style="s2">film and I got to see it at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.510" end="00:08:06.580" style="s2">University of Toronto and it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:09.430" style="s2">interesting to see some footage in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:12.580" style="s2">film at U of T of some of the protests</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.430" end="00:08:17.590" style="s2">there I believe it was when Pharaoh was</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.580" end="00:08:20.410" style="s2">doing his top they&#39;re taken so so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.590" end="00:08:23.890" style="s2">it definitely shed a lot of light on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.410" end="00:08:26.710" style="s2">the context of of what was happening and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.890" end="00:08:30.010" style="s2">I guess I guess I&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.710" end="00:08:32.440" style="s2">identified as a feminist myself but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.010" end="00:08:36.340" style="s2">wasn&#39;t anti-feminist either was just not</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.440" end="00:08:38.650" style="s2">not something I associated with my</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.340" end="00:08:40.630" style="s2">personal identity about I guess I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.650" end="00:08:42.430" style="s2">say but through the process of making</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.630" end="00:08:44.680" style="s2">this film it&#39;s made me kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:47.050" style="s2">about it more and I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.680" end="00:08:51.070" style="s2">things about feminism that I&#39;m grateful</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.050" end="00:08:53.769" style="s2">for my guess is I guess I probably would</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.070" end="00:08:56.230" style="s2">most align somewhat with fur</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.769" end="00:08:58.689" style="s2">wave feminism in the sense that I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.230" end="00:09:03.129" style="s2">grateful for the women that fought for</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.689" end="00:09:05.709" style="s2">female agency so but I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.129" end="00:09:07.209" style="s2">diverging so anyway it just it was one</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.709" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">of the things that got me thinking more</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.209" end="00:09:11.769" style="s2">deeply about topics that I never really</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:15.759" style="s2">thought about well do I identify as this</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.769" end="00:09:20.980" style="s2">so I found your journey with that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.759" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">with investigating it interesting and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.980" end="00:09:25.899" style="s2">felt like the way the film ended if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:28.329" style="s2">remember correctly that&#39;s when you say</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.899" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">that you dropped the label feminist and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.329" end="00:09:34.029" style="s2">I was I I felt kind of a sense like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:37.179" style="s2">story was unfinished in a way at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.029" end="00:09:39.339" style="s2">your personal story with it in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.179" end="00:09:42.309" style="s2">of you&#39;re still maybe kind of figuring</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.339" end="00:09:43.929" style="s2">out where you stand with it all because</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.309" end="00:09:49.389" style="s2">you were really surprised with what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.929" end="00:09:52.209" style="s2">found and I know that when I watched</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.389" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">your interview with David one of the I</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.209" end="00:09:57.999" style="s2">guess criticisms that you&#39;ve gone with</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:59.170" style="s2">the film was the feminists that you had</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.999" end="00:10:01.029" style="s2">interviewed in the film when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.170" end="00:10:02.579" style="s2">mentioned how a lot of people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.029" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">remember big red as if that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.579" end="00:10:06.699" style="s2">certain even if that&#39;s their name or red</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.860" style="s2">maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.699" end="00:10:09.970" style="s2">people tend to remember her the most as</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.860" end="00:10:11.379" style="s2">if that&#39;s the only feminist you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.970" end="00:10:13.809" style="s2">interviewed but she isn&#39;t the only</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.379" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">feminist that you interviewed but I know</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.809" end="00:10:17.799" style="s2">that one of my impressions when I first</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:19.660" style="s2">saw the film was I was curious why there</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.799" end="00:10:21.759" style="s2">weren&#39;t people like Christina Hoff</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.660" end="00:10:23.230" style="s2">Sommers or you know feminists that have</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.759" end="00:10:25.499" style="s2">more no one to use that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:28.389" style="s2">necessarily be completely shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.499" end="00:10:32.110" style="s2">men&#39;s rights or the fact that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.389" end="00:10:33.910" style="s2">there are issues that men face too but</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.110" end="00:10:36.939" style="s2">you did speak to that a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.910" end="00:10:39.129" style="s2">your last conversation with David as</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.939" end="00:10:40.929" style="s2">well as and I can appreciate it as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.129" end="00:10:43.480" style="s2">filmmaker that like there&#39;s only so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.929" end="00:10:45.100" style="s2">you can fit in the film and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.480" end="00:10:46.509" style="s2">what every Q&amp;A I get asked well why</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.100" end="00:10:48.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t you include some Harris and why</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.509" end="00:10:50.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t you include Jordan&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.279" end="00:10:54.189" style="s2">lecturers and so I get that as well but</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.919" end="00:10:55.869" style="s2">I guess um the the point I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.189" end="00:10:59.110" style="s2">make is it just it left me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.869" end="00:11:02.259" style="s2">curious of like where where did you go</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.110" end="00:11:04.449" style="s2">after in terms of your own journey and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.259" end="00:11:06.910" style="s2">your own views with it because in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.449" end="00:11:07.630" style="s2">the film is about the men&#39;s rights win</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.910" end="00:11:09.490" style="s2">but then it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.630" end="00:11:11.620" style="s2">about your journey through that and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:14.050" style="s2">it affected how you feel about feminism</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.620" end="00:11:18.490" style="s2">at least as you knew it so I guess it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.050" end="00:11:22.889" style="s2">just left me curious whether there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.490" end="00:11:25.060" style="s2">kind of more evolution from there or for</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.889" end="00:11:27.459" style="s2">how you feel about some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.060" end="00:11:30.660" style="s2">nuanced views about feminism and again</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.459" end="00:11:32.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;ve never been terribly active in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.660" end="00:11:34.600" style="s2">feminist circles and certainly not in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.889" end="00:11:37.509" style="s2">the way that you have so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.600" end="00:11:39.370" style="s2">you have a more tangible experience of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.509" end="00:11:42.670" style="s2">what what it means to you know have that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.370" end="00:11:46.180" style="s2">identity and be active with it as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.670" end="00:11:49.389" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s I guess the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.180" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">question that it left me with thank you</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.389" end="00:11:56.620" style="s2">I really appreciate you giving it a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:59.529" style="s2">thorough reaction to the film I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.620" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">seen the red pill in probably two years</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.529" end="00:12:05.380" style="s2">at least since now but then I watched it</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:07.029" style="s2">a couple weeks ago because it just for</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.380" end="00:12:09.670" style="s2">the first time became free on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.029" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">with ads so I was like no I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.670" end="00:12:14.019" style="s2">play in the background see what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:17.439" style="s2">thought and I was actually very shocked</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.019" end="00:12:19.899" style="s2">at how it felt feeling like a new viewer</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.439" end="00:12:21.759" style="s2">for the for the first time because you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.899" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">know you film for so many years and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.759" end="00:12:27.100" style="s2">you edit and then you see a million of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:29.589" style="s2">the screening yeah and it&#39;s really like</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.100" end="00:12:30.939" style="s2">I mean you can replay it in your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.589" end="00:12:33.730" style="s2">like you know it like to back your hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.939" end="00:12:35.560" style="s2">and so I had this long period pass where</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.730" end="00:12:39.699" style="s2">I hadn&#39;t seen it and then I watched it I</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.560" end="00:12:41.829" style="s2">guess maybe a month ago and and I did</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.699" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">think like that last line I no longer</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.829" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">call myself a feminist was like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:47.829" style="s2">bomb dropped and then just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:50.290" style="s2">dropped the bomb and then run away and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.829" end="00:12:52.420" style="s2">like you didn&#39;t explain why and I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.290" end="00:12:54.790" style="s2">thinking wow that&#39;s that is intense I</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.420" end="00:12:57.339" style="s2">could see why that really kind of merged</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.790" end="00:12:58.899" style="s2">people or made them stand up and cheer</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.339" end="00:13:02.439" style="s2">like their there were you know standing</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.899" end="00:13:04.420" style="s2">ovations at that line but yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.439" end="00:13:07.540" style="s2">you know just in the process of making</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.420" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">it I knew that I was starting my story</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.540" end="00:13:12.100" style="s2">explaining that I&#39;ve you know been a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:15.160" style="s2">feminist my entire life and you know my</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.100" end="00:13:18.250" style="s2">work has been revolving or revolved</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.160" end="00:13:21.130" style="s2">around women&#39;s issues and so I open with</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.250" end="00:13:23.770" style="s2">that as my identity it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.130" end="00:13:26.530" style="s2">I can see how you would feel like it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.770" end="00:13:29.190" style="s2">unfinished not explaining why I just say</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.530" end="00:13:33.100" style="s2">I no longer call myself a feminist and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.190" end="00:13:35.410" style="s2">not the film itself but more just it</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.100" end="00:13:37.690" style="s2">felt like it was like the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.410" end="00:13:39.250" style="s2">film but the start of your own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.690" end="00:13:42.700" style="s2">transformation or journey like</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.250" end="00:13:44.590" style="s2">unfinished in that yeah and and all you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.700" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">know it&#39;s a very quick answer all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.590" end="00:13:47.980" style="s2">that I&#39;ve told people when they ask well</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:51.070" style="s2">why don&#39;t you call yourself a feminist I</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.980" end="00:13:53.890" style="s2">I&#39;ve dropped all labels I mean it unless</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.070" end="00:13:56.020" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is actually like an</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.890" end="00:14:00.070" style="s2">identifying part of you whether say</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.020" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2">you&#39;re gay or you&#39;re Christian or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.070" end="00:14:06.010" style="s2">Republican those are you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.100" end="00:14:08.950" style="s2">those are labels that help communicate</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.010" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">in a shorthand manner how you identify</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.950" end="00:14:15.550" style="s2">politically or religiously or your</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:20.170" style="s2">sexual orientation but to say feminist</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.550" end="00:14:22.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not I think I really do think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.170" end="00:14:25.570" style="s2">the problem is everyone&#39;s definition of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.840" end="00:14:28.440" style="s2">feminism is different so to tell someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.570" end="00:14:30.760" style="s2">you&#39;re feminist that is not actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.440" end="00:14:31.690" style="s2">communicating with them your views</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.760" end="00:14:33.220" style="s2">because you don&#39;t know what their</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.690" end="00:14:36.640" style="s2">definition is and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.220" end="00:14:37.990" style="s2">interesting as well is having having</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.640" end="00:14:39.310" style="s2">interviewed both of you and spent a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.990" end="00:14:41.860" style="s2">little bit of time with both of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.310" end="00:14:44.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of suspicion in this area</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.860" end="00:14:48.070" style="s2">of covering these controversial topics</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.770" end="00:14:52.330" style="s2">in a sort of either a sensationalist way</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.070" end="00:14:53.860" style="s2">or a kind of bad faith way or but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.330" end="00:14:55.540" style="s2">impression I get from both of you and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:15:00.010" style="s2">remember it was after I spoke to Warren</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.540" end="00:15:03.580" style="s2">Farrell and Cassie that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.010" end="00:15:05.890" style="s2">you&#39;re in the film so much I had not</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.580" end="00:15:07.750" style="s2">suspicions but I did I did wonder like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.890" end="00:15:10.060" style="s2">how much of your journey was genuine and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.750" end="00:15:11.770" style="s2">how much of it was was for the Cameron</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.060" end="00:15:13.930" style="s2">for the narrative and talking to Warren</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.770" end="00:15:16.900" style="s2">I realized no you&#39;ve really gone in and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.930" end="00:15:18.520" style="s2">as a feminist wanting to know more about</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.900" end="00:15:21.190" style="s2">it and have your mind changed by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.520" end="00:15:23.890" style="s2">experience and I know Patricia you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.190" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">actually covering Jordan Pederson the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.890" end="00:15:28.840" style="s2">you are completely blindsided by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:30.490" style="s2">fact that the professor grants political</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.840" end="00:15:32.860" style="s2">correctness videos came out because you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.490" end="00:15:35.170" style="s2">were covering for the sort of Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:39.160" style="s2">perspective and so you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.170" end="00:15:41.619" style="s2">kind of went in with a real I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:44.889" style="s2">convinced that you both went in not</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.619" end="00:15:47.379" style="s2">wanting to kind of do a sensationalist</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.889" end="00:15:48.970" style="s2">film or in any way kind of exploiting</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.379" end="00:15:51.040" style="s2">the material it was very much in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.970" end="00:15:54.220" style="s2">of wanting to know like a really good</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.040" end="00:15:56.019" style="s2">faith attitude um and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.220" end="00:15:58.839" style="s2">similarity I think that both both of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.019" end="00:16:00.999" style="s2">have right right I guess in both</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.839" end="00:16:04.059" style="s2">instances we were surprised with what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.999" end="00:16:07.419" style="s2">what where the films took us I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.059" end="00:16:08.859" style="s2">could say definitely and we set out and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.419" end="00:16:10.509" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve read about your story</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.859" end="00:16:14.069" style="s2">Patricia we both set out with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.509" end="00:16:16.379" style="s2">different film in mind but then had to</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.069" end="00:16:20.379" style="s2">share the truth of what had actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.379" end="00:16:21.939" style="s2">unraveled while we were filming yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.379" end="00:16:24.220" style="s2">it&#39;s something also something that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.939" end="00:16:26.259" style="s2">really appreciate about your film is how</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.220" end="00:16:29.290" style="s2">much airtime you gave to critics of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.259" end="00:16:31.899" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.290" end="00:16:33.939" style="s2">people with my film have wondered oh is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.899" end="00:16:35.739" style="s2">she a men&#39;s rights activist was this a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.939" end="00:16:37.660" style="s2">propaganda piece was it funded by men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.739" end="00:16:40.899" style="s2">rights activists and all that I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.660" end="00:16:43.989" style="s2">say is no it was those assertions are</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.899" end="00:16:46.239" style="s2">not true um but you know there is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.989" end="00:16:49.269" style="s2">of speculation about the agenda of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.239" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">filmmaker and I I would think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.269" end="00:16:56.799" style="s2">someone that is really trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:58.299" style="s2">balanced and give give props to to both</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.799" end="00:17:00.129" style="s2">sides and both arguments for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.299" end="00:17:02.919" style="s2">audience to come to their own conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.129" end="00:17:04.419" style="s2">would give airtime to the critics of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.919" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re following whether it be</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.419" end="00:17:09.730" style="s2">joined Peterson or men&#39;s rights activist</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:14.019" style="s2">so but now you know three years after</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.730" end="00:17:16.299" style="s2">the film&#39;s release I a little part of me</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.019" end="00:17:19.449" style="s2">wonders was that the right decision</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.299" end="00:17:21.909" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t seem to matter in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.449" end="00:17:24.189" style="s2">end with the mainstream media smearing</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.909" end="00:17:26.069" style="s2">my name in the film and saying that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.189" end="00:17:29.580" style="s2">was propaganda or whatever else so</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.069" end="00:17:32.350" style="s2">including feminist</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.580" end="00:17:33.580" style="s2">academics and feminist professionals</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.350" end="00:17:38.200" style="s2">critiquing the men&#39;s rights movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.580" end="00:17:41.320" style="s2">within my film didn&#39;t seem to to help</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.200" end="00:17:44.169" style="s2">with the image of my film as being</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.320" end="00:17:47.590" style="s2">balanced so then I wonder well I could</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.169" end="00:17:48.910" style="s2">have taken that maybe 40 minutes within</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.590" end="00:17:50.530" style="s2">my two-hour film</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.910" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">actually gone into many of the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.530" end="00:17:53.980" style="s2">men&#39;s rights issues that I wasn&#39;t able</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:56.500" style="s2">to include because the time constraints</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.980" end="00:18:00.130" style="s2">things like false allegations or suicide</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.500" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">rates or sentencing disparity etc so my</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.130" end="00:18:07.300" style="s2">question for you Patricia&#39;s was it hard</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:10.870" style="s2">for you to include so much airtime to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.300" end="00:18:12.570" style="s2">the trans activists and to the critics</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.870" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">of Jordan Peterson like his friends</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.570" end="00:18:20.280" style="s2">Bernard and will rather than using that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:22.110" style="s2">time to go more into Jordan&#39;s ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.280" end="00:18:27.580" style="s2">writings and teachings</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.110" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">mm-hmm in my case no it wasn&#39;t difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.580" end="00:18:33.880" style="s2">to include those those voices in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">film and I think for the kind of film I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.880" end="00:18:39.220" style="s2">was trying to make it was integral to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.830" end="00:18:43.150" style="s2">because a lot of my film was about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.220" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">polarized nature of this topic and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.150" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">Jordan Peterson himself in his public</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:51.880" style="s2">persona became so polarized and if</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:53.380" style="s2">anyone watching has seen our poster you</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.880" end="00:18:55.570" style="s2">see Jordan portrayed as this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.380" end="00:18:57.190" style="s2">mythological figure with with this</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.570" end="00:18:59.470" style="s2">divide on both sides of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.190" end="00:19:02.550" style="s2">approaching him as a kind of Messiah or</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.470" end="00:19:07.570" style="s2">as a devil but then the film itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.550" end="00:19:11.080" style="s2">reveals him as vulnerable human being so</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.570" end="00:19:13.810" style="s2">in order to make a film about that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:17.890" style="s2">think it was really integral to include</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.810" end="00:19:19.960" style="s2">those voices and I know and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.890" end="00:19:21.910" style="s2">think even though I know what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.960" end="00:19:23.590" style="s2">in that you know even with our film it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.910" end="00:19:29.610" style="s2">like we we worked really hard to show</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.590" end="00:19:31.750" style="s2">the nuance and to to kind of build a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.610" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">comprehensive understanding of this from</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.750" end="00:19:36.210" style="s2">different perspectives but you know we</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:38.920" style="s2">still had some cancellations and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.210" end="00:19:41.020" style="s2">but at the end of the day I think the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.920" end="00:19:43.390" style="s2">most important thing is the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.020" end="00:19:45.930" style="s2">the film itself and you know regardless</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.390" end="00:19:47.710" style="s2">of how you know people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.930" end="00:19:51.670" style="s2">perceive it and you can never really</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.710" end="00:19:53.320" style="s2">please everyone unfortunately but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.670" end="00:19:54.820" style="s2">I know that when we had test screenings</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.320" end="00:19:56.470" style="s2">in our living room and when we brought</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.820" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">in people from different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.470" end="00:20:01.180" style="s2">and we had you know everyone from</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:03.340" style="s2">diehard and peterson fans people whose</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.180" end="00:20:05.669" style="s2">lives have been changed from george</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.340" end="00:20:09.519" style="s2">two self-proclaimed Marxists and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.669" end="00:20:11.619" style="s2">feminists LGBTQ people people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.519" end="00:20:13.629" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard of Jordan Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.619" end="00:20:15.340" style="s2">when we had them all in our living room</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.629" end="00:20:17.980" style="s2">and we were in this space where people</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.340" end="00:20:22.330" style="s2">could have genuine conversations I feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.980" end="00:20:24.489" style="s2">like the kind of transcendence of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.330" end="00:20:25.960" style="s2">culture war that we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.489" end="00:20:29.379" style="s2">achieve I feel like in our living room</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.960" end="00:20:32.529" style="s2">it happened but of course in theaters</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.379" end="00:20:35.230" style="s2">and and you know through the eyes of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.529" end="00:20:39.519" style="s2">media it&#39;s it&#39;s much harder to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.230" end="00:20:43.090" style="s2">that so so I think it was really</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.519" end="00:20:46.259" style="s2">important to include those other voices</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.090" end="00:20:48.549" style="s2">and I would say I wrote a bit about this</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.259" end="00:20:50.859" style="s2">maybe it was in the area article I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.549" end="00:20:54.070" style="s2">remember where but a lot of people use</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.859" end="00:20:56.649" style="s2">the word balanced to describe the rise</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.070" end="00:20:58.450" style="s2">of Jordan Peterson and and I get it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.649" end="00:21:01.059" style="s2">it kind of it makes sense as a shorthand</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.450" end="00:21:07.299" style="s2">but balance isn&#39;t actually what I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.059" end="00:21:09.779" style="s2">trying to Dallas isn&#39;t really what I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.299" end="00:21:12.820" style="s2">trying to achieve because there can be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.779" end="00:21:15.929" style="s2">superficiality to balance you know will</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.820" end="00:21:19.299" style="s2">include like X percentage of air time to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.929" end="00:21:23.259" style="s2">the opposition and and whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.299" end="00:21:25.090" style="s2">but it was more so about creating a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.259" end="00:21:27.429" style="s2">journey in the film that was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.090" end="00:21:29.710" style="s2">roller coaster ride because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.429" end="00:21:32.440" style="s2">it was like for me witnessing all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.710" end="00:21:35.019" style="s2">this unraveling and I think the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.440" end="00:21:37.029" style="s2">complicated and the truth is nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.019" end="00:21:41.169" style="s2">most of the time and it certainly was</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.029" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">the case for witnessing this story so</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.169" end="00:21:46.179" style="s2">those those aspects were necessary in</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.710" end="00:21:48.190" style="s2">order to paint that really full and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.179" end="00:21:50.529" style="s2">complex picture and to send people on</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.190" end="00:21:53.710" style="s2">that journey and sometimes make people</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.529" end="00:21:57.999" style="s2">uncomfortable and there have been you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.710" end="00:21:59.710" style="s2">know the art criticism from people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.999" end="00:22:01.509" style="s2">have said something like well you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.710" end="00:22:04.389" style="s2">this film is it&#39;s unfortunate that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.509" end="00:22:07.749" style="s2">film could have been used as more of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.389" end="00:22:09.190" style="s2">tool to make people like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.749" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">more and to kind of convert them into</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.190" end="00:22:14.230" style="s2">followers and I think that&#39;s propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.230" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">making and the irony is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:20.500" style="s2">it&#39;s not what Jordan Peterson&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:22.840" style="s2">heart of his philosophy that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.500" end="00:22:26.309" style="s2">he&#39;s about either so there&#39;s an irony</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.840" end="00:22:30.340" style="s2">there for people who are remark about</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.309" end="00:22:31.780" style="s2">way that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.340" end="00:22:38.679" style="s2">mischievous question that just came to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.780" end="00:22:42.100" style="s2">me there&#39;s some suspicion in this area</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.679" end="00:22:47.110" style="s2">of using this controversy to help sell</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.100" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">these films so do you and I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.110" end="00:22:50.110" style="s2">necessarily say that that&#39;s a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:51.910" style="s2">like Jordan Peterson said on the Joe</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.110" end="00:22:54.429" style="s2">Rogan show that he&#39;s learned to monetize</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.910" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">social justice warriors that actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.429" end="00:22:58.510" style="s2">the more that people scream about it if</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:00.790" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a good product then actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.510" end="00:23:02.710" style="s2">it helps the the marketing do you think</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.790" end="00:23:04.090" style="s2">it&#39;s helped in any way would you say</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.710" end="00:23:11.190" style="s2">that you&#39;d ever you&#39;ve ever played to</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.090" end="00:23:13.690" style="s2">that either of you I would say or are it</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.190" end="00:23:16.179" style="s2">helped in some ways and it&#39;s heard it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.690" end="00:23:19.750" style="s2">others and we&#39;re very well aware of both</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.179" end="00:23:21.040" style="s2">and we knew that so you know our film</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.750" end="00:23:24.970" style="s2">the premiere happened in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.040" end="00:23:26.470" style="s2">September 26 of this year and it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.970" end="00:23:28.600" style="s2">right around that time I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.470" end="00:23:30.549" style="s2">who was before or after that the news</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.600" end="00:23:32.440" style="s2">came out about the Carleton Theatre in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.549" end="00:23:34.210" style="s2">Toronto cancelling our week-long run</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.440" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">that was scheduled for right after that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.210" end="00:23:40.540" style="s2">premiere and you know I knew there were</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:42.580" style="s2">a lot of risks involved with this story</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.540" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">being public and being interviewed about</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.580" end="00:23:49.510" style="s2">it but at the same time I also thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:50.890" style="s2">you know it deserved to be public if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.510" end="00:23:53.820" style="s2">know people are asking about it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.890" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">going to answer questions about it so</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.820" end="00:23:58.150" style="s2">obviously there are the ways that it</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:23:59.890" style="s2">helped the film is you know when when</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.150" end="00:24:01.090" style="s2">something gets canceled people want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.890" end="00:24:03.309" style="s2">know well what is it what&#39;s so bad about</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.090" end="00:24:05.530" style="s2">it why I get it arouses curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.309" end="00:24:08.049" style="s2">it&#39;s natural that&#39;s human nature and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.530" end="00:24:10.900" style="s2">also made more media outlets interested</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.049" end="00:24:13.030" style="s2">in their story I frankly wish that more</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.900" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">of them we&#39;re interested in reviewing</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.030" end="00:24:15.429" style="s2">the film but most of them were</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:19.260" style="s2">interested in the story of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.429" end="00:24:21.790" style="s2">cancellation so there&#39;s that side of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.260" end="00:24:26.409" style="s2">but then the ways that I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.790" end="00:24:27.820" style="s2">hurt the film is because the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.409" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s being reported on is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.820" end="00:24:31.570" style="s2">cancellations it&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:34.029" style="s2">starts to put you in the same box of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.570" end="00:24:35.799" style="s2">perception of okay well so you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.029" end="00:24:38.529" style="s2">we got accused of adopting the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.799" end="00:24:40.120" style="s2">narrative as Jordan Peterson with with</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.529" end="00:24:43.720" style="s2">regards to cancellations</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.120" end="00:24:46.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting we were just doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.720" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">an interview about this yesterday and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.330" end="00:24:51.100" style="s2">were talking about how there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:53.529" style="s2">so ironically kind of postmodern about</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.100" end="00:24:56.500" style="s2">dismissing the reality of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.529" end="00:24:58.210" style="s2">happening as simply a narrative and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.500" end="00:25:01.179" style="s2">that actually heightens Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.210" end="00:25:03.190" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s argument and I understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.179" end="00:25:07.210" style="s2">where that criticism comes from because</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.190" end="00:25:08.740" style="s2">there is this benefit to you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.210" end="00:25:10.570" style="s2">gaining more attention when</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:13.450" style="s2">cancellations are happening and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.570" end="00:25:15.370" style="s2">we acknowledge that but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.450" end="00:25:18.490" style="s2">then we&#39;re sort of put in this box we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.370" end="00:25:19.960" style="s2">accused of things like that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.490" end="00:25:21.340" style="s2">there&#39;s certain media outlets that then</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.960" end="00:25:25.029" style="s2">become more interested in covering the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.340" end="00:25:26.769" style="s2">story than others and so it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.029" end="00:25:28.450" style="s2">more conservative media outlets so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.769" end="00:25:30.039" style="s2">know we when we&#39;re trying to try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.450" end="00:25:32.049" style="s2">send a culture where it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.039" end="00:25:33.669" style="s2">to navigate a media space that you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.049" end="00:25:37.210" style="s2">where you&#39;re immediately going to be put</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.669" end="00:25:38.980" style="s2">into a certain box and the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.210" end="00:25:43.779" style="s2">negative thing about that cancellation</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.980" end="00:25:45.789" style="s2">is that I mean the it&#39;s difficulty I say</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.779" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">we face is that I I really wish that our</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.789" end="00:25:49.870" style="s2">film could have gotten more screenings</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:52.149" style="s2">in mainstream and art house theaters and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.870" end="00:25:54.190" style="s2">a lot of those theaters look to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.149" end="00:25:56.049" style="s2">major markets like Toronto in New York</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.190" end="00:25:57.370" style="s2">and when we had that cancellation in</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.049" end="00:25:59.110" style="s2">Toronto a lot of all the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.370" end="00:26:00.610" style="s2">theatres said okay so I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.110" end="00:26:02.070" style="s2">touch that and we knew that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.610" end="00:26:03.909" style="s2">happening but now through this</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.070" end="00:26:06.789" style="s2">conversation I&#39;m having in the letter</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.909" end="00:26:08.980" style="s2">wiki platform this theater owner</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.789" end="00:26:13.179" style="s2">admitted that that happened in her case</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.980" end="00:26:14.590" style="s2">so it&#39;s very kind of trying to actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.179" end="00:26:16.210" style="s2">have something to point to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.590" end="00:26:19.480" style="s2">concrete evidence of what we knew was</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.210" end="00:26:22.350" style="s2">happening so in some ways it helps in</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.480" end="00:26:25.480" style="s2">some ways it hurts I guess I would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.350" end="00:26:29.139" style="s2">mmm-hmm yeah I definitely agree on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.480" end="00:26:31.720" style="s2">of those points and it is ironic how the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.139" end="00:26:34.809" style="s2">reactions to our films really do go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.720" end="00:26:36.909" style="s2">support the the topics discussed in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.809" end="00:26:38.799" style="s2">films even more you know within my film</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.909" end="00:26:42.429" style="s2">we talk about the silencing of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.799" end="00:26:43.180" style="s2">ideas in here the film was being pulled</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.429" end="00:26:49.240" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.180" end="00:26:50.890" style="s2">many theaters the most common protest t</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.240" end="00:26:53.050" style="s2">platforming kind of experience for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.890" end="00:26:56.290" style="s2">red pill was actually being accepted</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.050" end="00:27:00.100" style="s2">into theaters and then either feminist</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.290" end="00:27:03.040" style="s2">activist or probably extremist activist</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.100" end="00:27:05.590" style="s2">usually would protest the theater and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.040" end="00:27:08.410" style="s2">send threats and and then sometimes also</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.590" end="00:27:09.820" style="s2">board members going against the theater</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.410" end="00:27:12.130" style="s2">owner saying that you need to pull the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.820" end="00:27:13.930" style="s2">film so so oftentimes it was a booked</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.130" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">screening that was then removed which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.930" end="00:27:19.510" style="s2">why i think that&#39;s the perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:24.070" style="s2">of an attack on freedom of speech and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.510" end="00:27:26.140" style="s2">and you know a censorship kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.070" end="00:27:27.460" style="s2">know a form of censorship as if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.140" end="00:27:30.850" style="s2">book in a library that&#39;s now being</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.460" end="00:27:32.770" style="s2">pulled and burned so cuz some people</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.850" end="00:27:34.660" style="s2">said that it oh it&#39;s not censorship</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.770" end="00:27:37.330" style="s2">because you don&#39;t get to screen your</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.660" end="00:27:38.860" style="s2">film in this theater well we were going</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.330" end="00:27:40.450" style="s2">to screen the film in the theater and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.860" end="00:27:43.930" style="s2">people paid to watch it in the theater</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.450" end="00:27:46.390" style="s2">and then it was removed so um but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.930" end="00:27:47.770" style="s2">yeah what was the question again</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.390" end="00:27:49.870" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.770" end="00:27:53.310" style="s2">was there any temptation to play up to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.870" end="00:27:55.900" style="s2">that narrative I&#39;m being silenced and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.310" end="00:27:59.350" style="s2">and did you maybe play up to it a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.900" end="00:28:01.450" style="s2">a little bit I actually did not and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.350" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">know people can believe me or not it I</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.450" end="00:28:06.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know how else how many different</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:07.660" style="s2">ways to say the truth and and have</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.070" end="00:28:08.860" style="s2">people actually believe in it because it</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.660" end="00:28:12.850" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t work apparently</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:18.910" style="s2">but yeah I did not play into it we had</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.850" end="00:28:20.380" style="s2">no publicity you know machine or group</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.910" end="00:28:22.870" style="s2">of people sitting around a round table</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.380" end="00:28:24.790" style="s2">or even myself sitting at a table alone</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.870" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">pondering okay how can I get this film</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.790" end="00:28:30.490" style="s2">banned or censored or get people riled</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:32.380" style="s2">up and and I certainly know that happens</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.490" end="00:28:34.330" style="s2">because you know I&#39;ve seen it within</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.380" end="00:28:35.740" style="s2">feminist communities and men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.330" end="00:28:38.440" style="s2">communities where they are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.740" end="00:28:40.420" style="s2">think of ways to shocked and appalled or</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.440" end="00:28:42.460" style="s2">you know good attention you know like</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.420" end="00:28:44.620" style="s2">what&#39;s free the nipple you know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.460" end="00:28:47.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to get printed in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.620" end="00:28:48.490" style="s2">media and and you know this shock value</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.020" end="00:28:52.660" style="s2">and then the men&#39;s rights activists also</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.490" end="00:28:54.430" style="s2">do a lot of things that can can get you</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.660" end="00:28:56.210" style="s2">know negative media attention but they</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.430" end="00:29:01.400" style="s2">think alright any attention</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.210" end="00:29:04.550" style="s2">good attention so I really didn&#39;t stoke</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.400" end="00:29:06.080" style="s2">any kind of controversy fire I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.550" end="00:29:08.750" style="s2">except for making my film but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.080" end="00:29:10.700" style="s2">think that was set out to stoke the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.750" end="00:29:14.810" style="s2">controversy I was trying to share what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.700" end="00:29:17.180" style="s2">learned but you know I I honestly I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.810" end="00:29:20.030" style="s2">perfectly content if the film just you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.180" end="00:29:25.610" style="s2">know fell on deaths ears but but I sorry</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.030" end="00:29:27.800" style="s2">deaths deaths ears but I knew that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.610" end="00:29:29.420" style="s2">know this is the journey I went on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.800" end="00:29:32.090" style="s2">this is the best representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.420" end="00:29:33.350" style="s2">people I interviewed and and this you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.090" end="00:29:35.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s just two men to start</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.350" end="00:29:37.610" style="s2">conversations but say it never really</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.210" end="00:29:39.500" style="s2">got out in the world and it just you</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.610" end="00:29:43.700" style="s2">know collected dust I I would still</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.500" end="00:29:45.320" style="s2">sleep okay at night so the protests and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.700" end="00:29:48.770" style="s2">the controversy for me it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.320" end="00:29:50.360" style="s2">just a big pain you know I I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.770" end="00:29:51.980" style="s2">definitely a double-edged sword which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.360" end="00:29:54.710" style="s2">what Patricia I think was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.980" end="00:29:56.030" style="s2">where yeah it&#39;s great that more people</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.710" end="00:29:57.770" style="s2">are hearing about it because of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.030" end="00:29:59.450" style="s2">controversy and maybe going to see it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.770" end="00:30:02.630" style="s2">because they want to see what is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.450" end="00:30:07.640" style="s2">film that&#39;s banned mmm but then also a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.630" end="00:30:11.150" style="s2">lot of people have actively not seen my</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.640" end="00:30:12.860" style="s2">film because they&#39;ve just chosen to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.150" end="00:30:14.840" style="s2">on the side that we&#39;re gonna be against</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.860" end="00:30:16.550" style="s2">this film and we need to unite and stay</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.840" end="00:30:18.650" style="s2">together and I don&#39;t even want to watch</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.550" end="00:30:22.100" style="s2">it I don&#39;t want the filmmaker to get you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.650" end="00:30:24.440" style="s2">know any of my views on Amazon Prime or</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.100" end="00:30:29.030" style="s2">you know pay for a rental or whatever on</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.440" end="00:30:31.010" style="s2">iTunes so they I mean I&#39;ve brought up</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.030" end="00:30:33.050" style="s2">the film the red pill at different</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.010" end="00:30:34.700" style="s2">parties and people not knowing I was the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.050" end="00:30:36.830" style="s2">filmmaker and they would just roll their</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.700" end="00:30:38.500" style="s2">eyes and go all that trash and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.830" end="00:30:44.390" style="s2">oh did you see it and they&#39;re like no</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.500" end="00:30:46.790" style="s2">the filmmaker but so it is a double</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.390" end="00:30:48.920" style="s2">edged sword and you know in an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.790" end="00:30:51.530" style="s2">world the film would&#39;ve gone to Sundance</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.920" end="00:30:54.530" style="s2">or South by Southwest and done the kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.530" end="00:30:57.800" style="s2">of proper indie way of getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.530" end="00:31:00.410" style="s2">mainstream of getting accolades and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.800" end="00:31:03.860" style="s2">recognition from your community of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.410" end="00:31:06.380" style="s2">fellow filmmakers and you know people in</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.860" end="00:31:09.110" style="s2">the industry that that respect the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.380" end="00:31:10.340" style="s2">cinema is made but we didn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.110" end="00:31:13.159" style="s2">option you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.340" end="00:31:14.450" style="s2">submitted to festivals and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.159" end="00:31:16.730" style="s2">applied for grants we never raised</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.450" end="00:31:21.080" style="s2">funding through that way which is why I</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.730" end="00:31:23.150" style="s2">did the Kickstarter campaign and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.080" end="00:31:25.220" style="s2">I mean I guess to categorize it in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.150" end="00:31:27.770" style="s2">head I guess the way to make it as an</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.220" end="00:31:29.480" style="s2">indie filmmaker now is to either be</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.770" end="00:31:31.159" style="s2">accepted by the mainstream and get into</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.480" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">the big film festivals or immediately</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.159" end="00:31:38.539" style="s2">get great distribution and just I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:42.409" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the easier way I mean as</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.539" end="00:31:43.850" style="s2">far as the opposite option is you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.409" end="00:31:45.350" style="s2">declined from all the mainstream that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.850" end="00:31:48.140" style="s2">the mainstream media really tries to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.350" end="00:31:50.360" style="s2">smear in every different way and really</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.140" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">the only way to get out to the public is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.360" end="00:31:56.539" style="s2">to how that Venus talked about whether</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">it be on the forums online or just word</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.539" end="00:32:00.860" style="s2">of mouth and people being shy about</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:03.649" style="s2">sharing it because they don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.860" end="00:32:06.740" style="s2">know what side you&#39;re on and it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.649" end="00:32:09.890" style="s2">like this nefarious or like you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.740" end="00:32:11.090" style="s2">secretive kind of movement and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.890" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">ended up being the case with the red</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.090" end="00:32:17.330" style="s2">pill but yeah I certainly didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t seek it out and I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.330" end="00:32:21.140" style="s2">something Patricia was hinting at before</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.950" end="00:32:23.450" style="s2">about that we&#39;re in an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.140" end="00:32:26.809" style="s2">a loss of things are you could say</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.450" end="00:32:28.610" style="s2">weaponized that that certain topics or</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.809" end="00:32:31.130" style="s2">immediately sort of drawn into this sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.610" end="00:32:32.299" style="s2">of culture war dynamic that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.130" end="00:32:35.510" style="s2">kind of assumes that you&#39;re on one side</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.299" end="00:32:37.220" style="s2">or the other how&#39;s that being for you</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.510" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">both like covering something that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.220" end="00:32:43.399" style="s2">this polarizing what&#39;s the experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:46.580" style="s2">beams it being at all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.399" end="00:32:50.710" style="s2">eye-opening or radicalizing or how has</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.580" end="00:32:55.640" style="s2">it shifted your perspectives it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.710" end="00:32:57.830" style="s2">well it&#39;s been challenging it&#39;s opened</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.640" end="00:32:59.899" style="s2">my eyes to a lot of things and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.830" end="00:33:02.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more like politically that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.899" end="00:33:04.909" style="s2">I&#39;ve come to learn and also to question</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.539" end="00:33:07.940" style="s2">and myself and kind of shake out some</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.909" end="00:33:12.380" style="s2">beliefs that were more superficial but</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.940" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">also it&#39;s also something that was just</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.380" end="00:33:18.340" style="s2">coming to mind with this is I would say</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">that we also experience some of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.340" end="00:33:24.200" style="s2">kind of pushback on the right is well so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.200" end="00:33:28.309" style="s2">I mean because we we sort of give up on</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:30.019" style="s2">mainstream in our house cinemas at some</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.309" end="00:33:31.879" style="s2">point we were looking to schedule</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.019" end="00:33:34.279" style="s2">screenings at churches and with local</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.879" end="00:33:36.379" style="s2">groups and Jordan Peters and meetup</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.279" end="00:33:38.749" style="s2">groups and just see you know what will</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.379" end="00:33:41.659" style="s2">venues we could rent out and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.749" end="00:33:42.919" style="s2">we built our North American tour and at</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.659" end="00:33:48.009" style="s2">one point we were talking with</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.919" end="00:33:50.330" style="s2">turning-point and they basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.009" end="00:33:51.859" style="s2">explicitly alluded to the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.330" end="00:33:53.480" style="s2">were interested in seeing whether there</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.859" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">were parts of the film that they could</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.480" end="00:34:00.169" style="s2">use for the next election and I was glad</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:02.659" style="s2">that once they saw the film which which</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.169" end="00:34:04.190" style="s2">you know I I was very a gangsta now</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.659" end="00:34:07.489" style="s2">because I&#39;m not interested in the film</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.190" end="00:34:08.990" style="s2">be used as a propaganda tool but I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.489" end="00:34:11.000" style="s2">glad that once they saw the film we</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.990" end="00:34:15.589" style="s2">never got a call back and then okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.000" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">we&#39;re doing something right here and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.589" end="00:34:21.559" style="s2">it just happens to be that the left and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:23.659" style="s2">the progressives those are the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.559" end="00:34:25.339" style="s2">that are running the art house and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.659" end="00:34:28.700" style="s2">mainstream cinemas because most of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.339" end="00:34:31.460" style="s2">artists tend to be on the left and so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.700" end="00:34:34.040" style="s2">think this phenomenon very much exists</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.460" end="00:34:36.319" style="s2">on the other side too it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.040" end="00:34:38.690" style="s2">those aren&#39;t the people typically that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.319" end="00:34:40.460" style="s2">are running the cinemas and there have</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.690" end="00:34:42.440" style="s2">been a couple of cinemas that after</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.460" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">hearing about the cancellations they</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.440" end="00:34:47.329" style="s2">contacted us and said we&#39;ll screen your</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:49.639" style="s2">film at our cinema and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.329" end="00:34:51.700" style="s2">tended to be the like Trump supporters</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.639" end="00:34:54.109" style="s2">I&#39;m more conservative my goal people</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.700" end="00:34:57.109" style="s2">that we&#39;re running those cinemas that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.109" end="00:35:06.710" style="s2">approached us I don&#39;t know if I entered</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.109" end="00:35:08.059" style="s2">your question though so as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.710" end="00:35:11.569" style="s2">understand the question David you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.059" end="00:35:14.210" style="s2">asking with this polarization around our</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.569" end="00:35:17.809" style="s2">films how we kind of landed right on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.210" end="00:35:19.730" style="s2">on the field is that right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.809" end="00:35:22.760" style="s2">what&#39;s the impact being on you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.730" end="00:35:24.230" style="s2">personally I know I remember from from</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.760" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">our interview before I think Warren</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.230" end="00:35:29.420" style="s2">Farrell said you enter him to ask how am</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:31.220" style="s2">I gonna lose lots of my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.420" end="00:35:35.630" style="s2">hoping that he would kind of put your</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.220" end="00:35:36.790" style="s2">mind at rest if he said yes so yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.630" end="00:35:39.850" style="s2">how is it being making</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.790" end="00:35:41.500" style="s2">about something this topical but this</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.850" end="00:35:43.330" style="s2">polarizing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.500" end="00:35:46.300" style="s2">yeah actually many of my interviews</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.330" end="00:35:48.550" style="s2">warned me that if I tell the truth I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.300" end="00:35:52.270" style="s2">will be essentially burned at the stake</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.550" end="00:35:55.240" style="s2">for it and Warren Farrell did tell me</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.270" end="00:35:56.680" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know if he told me while</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.240" end="00:36:00.070" style="s2">we&#39;re filming maybe after the film was</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.680" end="00:36:01.930" style="s2">released but he said you will lose a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.070" end="00:36:04.210" style="s2">of your friends and so I started asking</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.930" end="00:36:06.100" style="s2">him about what he experienced and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.210" end="00:36:07.660" style="s2">was one of the few times that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.100" end="00:36:11.350" style="s2">Warren break down crying I hope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.660" end="00:36:13.960" style="s2">okay to say that but but yeah he because</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.350" end="00:36:17.950" style="s2">he was so involved in feminism through</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.960" end="00:36:20.020" style="s2">you know the late 60s 70s and Beyond and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.950" end="00:36:23.170" style="s2">then and then really started digging</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.020" end="00:36:27.670" style="s2">into men&#39;s issues and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.170" end="00:36:29.110" style="s2">adding okay I&#39;m my family says I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.670" end="00:36:31.930" style="s2">queen about it analogies and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.110" end="00:36:33.970" style="s2">of this new about analogy that helps</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.930" end="00:36:35.500" style="s2">explain what the red pill was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.970" end="00:36:37.720" style="s2">do I think what Warren Ferrell&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.500" end="00:36:40.510" style="s2">tries to do which is imagine this jar</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.720" end="00:36:42.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s pennies being put in the jar</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.510" end="00:36:44.620" style="s2">and you know feminists are so long have</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.670" end="00:36:47.320" style="s2">been saying oh you know we&#39;ve got human</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.620" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">sex trafficking and we have maturity</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.320" end="00:36:50.950" style="s2">issues and we have you know sexual</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.210" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">assaults and all these things and keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.950" end="00:36:57.820" style="s2">putting incense and Warren Farrell and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:59.530" style="s2">other other academics or if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.820" end="00:37:01.660" style="s2">call them activists are trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.530" end="00:37:03.700" style="s2">men&#39;s issues to this discussion and try</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.660" end="00:37:07.240" style="s2">to throw their two cents in literally</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.700" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">and you know everyone else in the gender</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.240" end="00:37:10.210" style="s2">political world is throwing it out</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:13.510" style="s2">saying your since they&#39;re not allowed in</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.210" end="00:37:15.910" style="s2">this jar so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not there that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.510" end="00:37:18.970" style="s2">the red pill is trying to say oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.910" end="00:37:20.680" style="s2">actually the way you know that the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.970" end="00:37:22.450" style="s2">works that women have the power and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.680" end="00:37:24.520" style="s2">men are the only oppressed gender the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.450" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">only gender that has issues not that at</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.520" end="00:37:32.620" style="s2">all it&#39;s just adding the two cents to an</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:34.420" style="s2">already very vast amount of films and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.620" end="00:37:37.120" style="s2">books and podcasts and whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.420" end="00:37:40.900" style="s2">about feminist issues or trans issues or</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.120" end="00:37:42.520" style="s2">whatever else so the reason I have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.900" end="00:37:45.550" style="s2">say that is because I still do have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.520" end="00:37:47.260" style="s2">lot of of my feminist friends that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.550" end="00:37:50.460" style="s2">remained my friend and they would even</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.260" end="00:37:53.670" style="s2">say despite the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.460" end="00:37:55.870" style="s2">but you know they have hang-ups that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.670" end="00:37:59.590" style="s2">that they&#39;re thinking that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.870" end="00:38:01.780" style="s2">discounting women&#39;s issues or or all</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.590" end="00:38:04.180" style="s2">these other things and so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.780" end="00:38:05.880" style="s2">trying to illustrate that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.180" end="00:38:08.100" style="s2">adding to the discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.880" end="00:38:10.810" style="s2">unfortunately that&#39;s the source spot</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.100" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">right now at least in the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.810" end="00:38:14.230" style="s2">probably a lot longer than the last few</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:17.020" style="s2">years but at least with the release of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.230" end="00:38:19.540" style="s2">the red pill I&#39;ve really seen that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.020" end="00:38:26.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the area that you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.540" end="00:38:28.840" style="s2">to speak up and you know I at first so</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.140" end="00:38:31.480" style="s2">talking about the polarization I also</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.840" end="00:38:35.260" style="s2">want to add that you can&#39;t choose your</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.480" end="00:38:37.240" style="s2">fans and that&#39;s something that has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.260" end="00:38:39.850" style="s2">difficult for me is that there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.240" end="00:38:41.650" style="s2">of people who&#39;ve I&#39;m gonna say a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.850" end="00:38:43.180" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely a my very small</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.650" end="00:38:45.190" style="s2">percentage of all the fans of the red</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.180" end="00:38:48.940" style="s2">pill but there is a small percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.190" end="00:38:50.770" style="s2">people who I would not align with and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.940" end="00:38:52.990" style="s2">would not want them representing the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.770" end="00:38:55.420" style="s2">film or sharing with people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.990" end="00:38:57.940" style="s2">them being the spokesperson for it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.420" end="00:38:59.380" style="s2">nevertheless they they are fans of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.940" end="00:39:02.590" style="s2">film and they&#39;re trying to get it out in</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.380" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">the world and and it is it is a weird</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.590" end="00:39:11.530" style="s2">thing that I&#39;ve had to I guess accept is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">you can&#39;t pick your fans and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.530" end="00:39:19.050" style="s2">it sounds like Patricia&#39;s liberal or at</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:21.970" style="s2">least was at some point I I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.050" end="00:39:23.350" style="s2">progressive liberal most of my life and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.970" end="00:39:25.930" style="s2">then the last few years I would say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.350" end="00:39:30.130" style="s2">more Center but I&#39;m definitely not right</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.930" end="00:39:32.650" style="s2">and and we do have a lot of supporters</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.130" end="00:39:35.860" style="s2">on the right and because the film is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.650" end="00:39:39.730" style="s2">released a month before Trump was</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.860" end="00:39:43.150" style="s2">elected then you know it came out at</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.730" end="00:39:45.100" style="s2">this highly polarized time and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.150" end="00:39:48.130" style="s2">people who attended our film screenings</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.100" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">had the maggots on and I had a feminist</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.130" end="00:39:51.370" style="s2">friend of mine a longtime friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:56.110" style="s2">who went to a screening of the film in</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.370" end="00:39:58.840" style="s2">Denver Colorado and she she was and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.110" end="00:40:00.910" style="s2">don&#39;t use this word facetiously but she</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.840" end="00:40:03.010" style="s2">was triggered by seeing so many maggot</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.910" end="00:40:03.790" style="s2">hats in the theater and she had to walk</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.010" end="00:40:05.800" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.790" end="00:40:08.760" style="s2">collect herself before the film started</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.800" end="00:40:11.170" style="s2">because just seeing that angered her and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.760" end="00:40:12.610" style="s2">long story short she went to the film</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.170" end="00:40:14.650" style="s2">with her boyfriend and that night they</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.610" end="00:40:18.280" style="s2">ended up breaking up because of their</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.650" end="00:40:20.050" style="s2">differing views on the film so you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.280" end="00:40:21.670" style="s2">I hate hearing stories like that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.050" end="00:40:24.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to think that the film is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.670" end="00:40:28.090" style="s2">dividing people in that way but I have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.460" end="00:40:31.920" style="s2">also heard so many more stories of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.090" end="00:40:35.290" style="s2">film uniting partners and allowing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.920" end="00:40:38.350" style="s2">husbands or sons or Father&#39;s to open up</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.290" end="00:40:40.090" style="s2">about their difficulties and have you</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.350" end="00:40:45.820" style="s2">know how their stories fall on receptive</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.090" end="00:40:48.910" style="s2">ears and so it&#39;s been hard but I do hope</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.820" end="00:40:51.190" style="s2">that our films will stand the test of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.910" end="00:40:54.330" style="s2">time and that they can be looked back on</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.190" end="00:40:59.650" style="s2">you know 20-plus years from now and just</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.330" end="00:41:02.590" style="s2">be an example of not only the content of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.650" end="00:41:04.540" style="s2">the film but also their reactions to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.590" end="00:41:06.850" style="s2">film making a statement about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.540" end="00:41:09.490" style="s2">culture we live in today and so in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.850" end="00:41:13.000" style="s2">way I think our films have many layers</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.490" end="00:41:15.460" style="s2">of lessons and you know kind of having</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.000" end="00:41:17.590" style="s2">your finger on the pulse of society to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.460" end="00:41:19.900" style="s2">see how they react right now I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.590" end="00:41:22.710" style="s2">ask you both what we&#39;ve got coming up</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.900" end="00:41:24.670" style="s2">next what your your next projects I</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.710" end="00:41:27.520" style="s2">guess Patricia you&#39;re probably still in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.670" end="00:41:28.870" style="s2">the middle of promoting rise of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.520" end="00:41:32.220" style="s2">Peterson but have you given any thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.870" end="00:41:36.340" style="s2">about what you&#39;re gonna be doing next</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.220" end="00:41:37.750" style="s2">definitely so the the next big project I</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.340" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">wanted to tackles I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.750" end="00:41:42.010" style="s2">the original film that I was making</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:44.410" style="s2">about Jordan and his friendship with</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.010" end="00:41:46.150" style="s2">indigenous Carver Charles Joseph and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.410" end="00:41:48.790" style="s2">think we may have talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.150" end="00:41:51.460" style="s2">our previous interview I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.790" end="00:41:53.080" style="s2">how in-depth we went into it but the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.460" end="00:41:55.240" style="s2">initial story that I was making for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.080" end="00:41:58.330" style="s2">year and a half before Jordan released</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.240" end="00:42:00.220" style="s2">those videos was about how Charles</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.330" end="00:42:01.870" style="s2">Joseph who&#39;s from the quak quak quak</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.220" end="00:42:04.330" style="s2">nation he lives in the west coast of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.870" end="00:42:08.260" style="s2">Canada Charles&#39;s family was adopting</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.330" end="00:42:09.970" style="s2">Jordan into their family and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.260" end="00:42:13.120" style="s2">for that was because of the significance</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.970" end="00:42:16.210" style="s2">of the artwork that Charles was giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.120" end="00:42:17.590" style="s2">to making for Jordan there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.210" end="00:42:20.050" style="s2">protocol that has to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.590" end="00:42:22.200" style="s2">be followed and it&#39;s not just a matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.050" end="00:42:24.940" style="s2">of buying art it&#39;s theirs they&#39;re sacred</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.200" end="00:42:27.310" style="s2">things that are in their sacred</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.940" end="00:42:29.230" style="s2">symbology and stories that are in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.310" end="00:42:31.000" style="s2">artwork and so there&#39;s a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.230" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">that comes with that and so Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.000" end="00:42:36.310" style="s2">now his brother and so I was filming</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:38.890" style="s2">sacred ceremonies that were taking place</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.310" end="00:42:40.300" style="s2">and also the renovations at majora team</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.890" end="00:42:42.220" style="s2">was doing to his home he was adding the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.300" end="00:42:44.140" style="s2">third floor modeled after an indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.220" end="00:42:46.780" style="s2">longhouse and it was filled with</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.140" end="00:42:48.520" style="s2">Charles&#39;s artwork so for a year and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.780" end="00:42:50.050" style="s2">half I was making a film about that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.520" end="00:42:52.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what I intend on going back and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.050" end="00:42:54.550" style="s2">finishing now that we&#39;ve just wrapped up</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.510" end="00:42:56.980" style="s2">our tour we stopped planning some</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.550" end="00:42:59.740" style="s2">screenings and we will be planning a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.980" end="00:43:03.220" style="s2">small tour in Asia in the spring in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.740" end="00:43:05.050" style="s2">March but yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.220" end="00:43:06.790" style="s2">be tackling next and the film is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.050" end="00:43:08.680" style="s2">tentatively called Mahalo which in</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.790" end="00:43:13.260" style="s2">Quaqua l&#39;m just Charles&#39;s language means</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.680" end="00:43:20.380" style="s2">to dream and kasi you said you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.260" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">hibernating for a while well I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.380" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">on a new feature now I&#39;m very excited</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">about it we&#39;ll be filming all throughout</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:31.120" style="s2">2020 and so the red pill was my third</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:32.710" style="s2">feature documentary the first was called</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.120" end="00:43:35.170" style="s2">daddy I do and it was about women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.710" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">issues the second was the right to love</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.170" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">and it was about LGBTQ issues and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:42.040" style="s2">know the red pill was about the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:44.470" style="s2">rights movement so I&#39;ve definitely been</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.040" end="00:43:48.280" style="s2">you know gender politics has been my</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.470" end="00:43:49.710" style="s2">wheelhouse but this film is the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.280" end="00:43:52.300" style="s2">time really kind of stepping out of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.710" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">although gender politics is a huge topic</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.300" end="00:43:58.810" style="s2">I would say this new film is even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:44:00.250" style="s2">and more widespread so just I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.810" end="00:44:03.340" style="s2">little teaser I won&#39;t go into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.250" end="00:44:06.070" style="s2">thing but this film will be looking into</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.340" end="00:44:09.010" style="s2">trauma and something that I&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.070" end="00:44:11.620" style="s2">learned from all my previous work is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.010" end="00:44:13.740" style="s2">that trauma does not discriminate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.620" end="00:44:19.600" style="s2">across all genders all socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.740" end="00:44:21.910" style="s2">statuses all races all ages and so you</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.600" end="00:44:26.650" style="s2">know I&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve been filmmaking for</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.910" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">well since 2008 and I&#39;ve seen and heard</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.650" end="00:44:30.940" style="s2">so many heartbreaking stories and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:31.510" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s actually a seems like</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.940" end="00:44:33.310" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.510" end="00:44:34.840" style="s2">drama and they&#39;re in their past or</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.310" end="00:44:38.530" style="s2">something that they&#39;re eventually going</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.840" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">to face that&#39;s difficult and so this</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.530" end="00:44:45.730" style="s2">film aims to to look at how we can heal</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:48.310" style="s2">a lot of these wounds and yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.730" end="00:44:52.780" style="s2">really excited about it and I&#39;ll be</p>
