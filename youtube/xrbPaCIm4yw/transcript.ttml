<p begin="00:00:49.780" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">Now one of the things that people are very<br />much confused by in the modern world is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:01:00.649" style="s2">archaic people meant by gods, and that’s<br />because whatever the deities were that had</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.649" end="00:01:04.360" style="s2">the motive force that archaic people attributed<br />to the gods seemed to have disappeared in</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.360" end="00:01:10.330" style="s2">modern culture. Now the Jungian in hypothesis<br />is that’s because they turned into psychological</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.330" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">traits, fundamentally, or motivational forces,<br />so what the, what archaic societies would</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:19.160" style="s2">describe as gods, we would describe as motivational<br />forces,</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.160" end="00:01:24.690" style="s2">so, for example, Venus is a goddess, the goddess<br />of love, and we would associate her power</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.690" end="00:01:31.690" style="s2">with love and sex fundamentally, and the reason<br />that that’s a reasonable association from</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.630" end="00:01:39.049" style="s2">the archaic standpoint is because the motive<br />quality that makes up what Venus represents</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.049" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">is transpersonal, which means it’s not limited<br />to one person and it’s immortal in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:50.780" style="s2">the motive force that characterizes sexual<br />affiliation exists whether or not a single</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.780" end="00:01:54.600" style="s2">individual exists.<br />so it’s transpersonal, has the force of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.600" end="00:02:00.909" style="s2">a personality , because, if you fall in love,<br />you’re motivated by a certain set of standards</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.909" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">and perspectives, right, if you’re gripped<br />by beauty, say, or if you’re gripped by</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:11.870" style="s2">lust, that imposes a particular view of the<br />world on you and impels your actions, sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.870" end="00:02:17.130" style="s2">despite your will, and so that would be equivalent,<br />from the archaic perspective, to possession.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.130" end="00:02:22.260" style="s2">And it’s clearly the case that archaic societies<br />who are engaged in warfare, for example, would</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.260" end="00:02:27.230" style="s2">conduct rituals to ensure that the warriors<br />that made up their societies were, in fact,</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.230" end="00:02:31.620" style="s2">possessed by the correct god, so it might<br />be Mars, for example, the Roman God of War,</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.620" end="00:02:35.209" style="s2">so that on the battlefield they exhibited<br />the proper characteristics of somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.209" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">was in a battle, right, rage you can think,<br />rage, so possession by the God of War would</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:43.970" style="s2">be equivalent to this possession by a state<br />of rage</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.970" end="00:02:49.870" style="s2">Now, it’s not quite that simple, it isn’t<br />only that archaic people externalized motive</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.870" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">forces and gave them the status of deities,<br />what they did was more complex than that,</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:57.440" style="s2">and I think you can understand that a little<br />bit better if you start to, if you start to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:03:02.019" style="s2">give some, uh, thought to the modern behavioral<br />notion of the stimulus.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.019" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">Now the stimulus is a very, very weird concept,<br />because the behaviourists who were interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:12.320" style="s2">in taking apart what was inside the brain<br />would attribute motive force to the stimulus,</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.320" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">right, they’d say, if you present an animal<br />with a stimulus, he will therefor act, and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:22.419" style="s2">that meant that the behaviours were making<br />the presupposition that the motive power resided</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.419" end="00:03:26.320" style="s2">in some manner in the stimulus. Well and why,<br />why would they think like that?</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.320" end="00:03:31.850" style="s2">Well, it’s an archaic mode of thought in<br />a sense. You can imagine a child saying, um,</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.850" end="00:03:36.940" style="s2">one of my friends today made me really angry,<br />right, which means that the child is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.940" end="00:03:42.419" style="s2">conflating his or her own internal emotional<br />state with the proximal stimulus that gave</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.419" end="00:03:47.570" style="s2">rise to that state, and you see complex associations<br />like that taking place with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.570" end="00:03:51.940" style="s2">apprehension of beauty, say, because beauty<br />is a very, very complex and difficult to localize</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.940" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">phenomena; if you’re very attracted to someone,<br />are you attracted by them? Well in a sense,</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:01.570" style="s2">of course, you are, because there they are,<br />but in another sense you’re not at all because</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.570" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">what’s happening is that you’re engaged<br />as much in the in attraction as anything that’s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.729" style="s2">motivating you from the outside world, and<br />I think that partly accounts for your sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.729" end="00:04:16.130" style="s2">of foolishness, especially if the person that<br />you’re attracted to doesn’t return your</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.130" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">attraction,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.410" end="00:04:23.410" style="s2">I mean, you, you know that from your perceptual<br />perspective you’re attracted and dominated</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.699" end="00:04:29.030" style="s2">by the object, but, uh, by the same token,<br />you know entirely that, easy as it is to presume</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.030" end="00:04:34.660" style="s2">it’s them and their fault, say, pretty much<br />it all has to do with you, so in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.660" end="00:04:39.069" style="s2">world where we’ve been able to separate<br />out the object and the motive force of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.069" end="00:04:44.009" style="s2">object, the deities have sort of moved inside<br />of us and become psychological forces, but</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.009" end="00:04:47.659" style="s2">you can understand if you think about it in<br />this manner that things weren’t so clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.659" end="00:04:52.409" style="s2">prior to the dawn of the empirical age,</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.409" end="00:04:59.409" style="s2">that gives you a little bit of background<br />with regards to what the notion of deity meant</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.689" end="00:05:07.689" style="s2">to archaic societies who still utilize those<br />notions as explanatory terms. Okay, so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.870" end="00:05:13.729" style="s2">know that if you’re caught up in one of<br />these little, uh, world games, that you may</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.729" end="00:05:18.729" style="s2">be motivated by something very, very fundamental,<br />right, a, a tendency that transcends you the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.729" end="00:05:24.979" style="s2">tendency to propagate yourself, say, Freud’s<br />fundamental motivational level, sexual affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.979" end="00:05:31.330" style="s2">or the tendency to maintain yourself, those<br />you could say are the fundamental gods of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.330" end="00:05:35.900" style="s2">existence, the fundamental driving forces,<br />and it’s there, it’s the interaction of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.900" end="00:05:40.729" style="s2">those two forces over great periods of time<br />that produce the great diversity of life and,</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.729" end="00:05:45.389" style="s2">and human life, that we see before us, and<br />each of those fundamental, most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.389" end="00:05:52.389" style="s2">of gods, have their differentiated minion<br />so to speak so that while engaged in the meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.870" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">goal of self preservation, you act out plots<br />of hunger and plots of thirst and you move</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:06.229" style="s2">from cold to hot or from hot to cold depending<br />on your particular, uh, on your particular,</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.229" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">on the particular temperature of your surroundings<br />or with regards to self propagation.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:15.289" style="s2">You’re attracted to people or are repelled<br />by them for reasons that are frequently absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.289" end="00:06:19.169" style="s2">beyond your comprehension by the way, so I<br />just found out this week, uh, and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.169" end="00:06:24.419" style="s2">absolutely staggering, I think, that if you,<br />um, if you run an experiment on a group of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.419" end="00:06:29.219" style="s2">women and you track their menstrual cycle,<br />and then you give them t-shirts that men have</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.219" end="00:06:35.020" style="s2">worn to smell, that women who are ovulating<br />like the smell of symmetrical men better than</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.020" end="00:06:39.479" style="s2">A-symmetrical men, so and that’s partly<br />because symmetrical men are probably more</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.479" end="00:06:45.439" style="s2">healthy, but this is a good example of how<br />the motive forces that configure your world</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.439" end="00:06:50.030" style="s2">are dependent on instinctual forces that are<br />not only beyond your consciousness, but they’re</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.030" end="00:06:55.610" style="s2">beyond even, at the moment, any of our, uh,<br />explicit explanations.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.610" end="00:07:02.610" style="s2">So, uh, another finding that’s very similar<br />that I came across recently, it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.280" end="00:07:10.999" style="s2">that mice will not mate with mice that have<br />RH blood factors that are likely to produce,</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.999" end="00:07:17.999" style="s2">um, unfit offspring, uh, the more closely<br />genetically related the RH factors, the more</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.050" end="00:07:23.719" style="s2">likely there is to be a, a, an, a catastrophe<br />with regards to offspring, and the mice seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.719" end="00:07:28.900" style="s2">to detect the RH factor by smell so recently<br />this was run by, with women, and it is also</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.900" end="00:07:33.289" style="s2">the case that women prefer men whose RH factors<br />are at an optimal distance from them in terms</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.289" end="00:07:38.110" style="s2">of smell, so this is some example of how these<br />unbelievably archaic systems, ‘cause like</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.110" end="00:07:44.979" style="s2">the old factory systems are unbelievably archaic,<br />produce alterations in world view at a level</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.979" end="00:07:51.979" style="s2">that’s massively below consciousness, so<br />underneath your cortical shell, which is tonically</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:07:59.999" style="s2">inhibiting all your emotional and motivational<br />systems, lies all these motivational and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.999" end="00:08:04.229" style="s2">systems, and they have branches that grow<br />up into the cortex, and they have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.229" end="00:08:10.029" style="s2">to control your behaviour completely and voluntarily,<br />so, for example, if you’re gripped by fear,</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.029" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">if you’re gripped by fear, it’s very,<br />very difficult to overcome that voluntarily,</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:17.379" style="s2">and at least initially you won’t be able<br />to, which is to say that when the chips are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.379" end="00:08:24.279" style="s2">down, the underlying motivational and emotional<br />systems have control. Okay. So then what happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.279" end="00:08:28.039" style="s2">from that perspective, then what happens when<br />you encounter something you don’t understand,</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.039" end="00:08:32.810" style="s2">and I think the best way to explain it is<br />something like generalize disinhibition, which</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.810" end="00:08:38.229" style="s2">is that all your underlying motivational and<br />emotional systems are more or less disinhibited</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.229" end="00:08:42.430" style="s2">simultaneously, and the reason for that is<br />because you want to be maximally prepared</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:46.610" style="s2">to do whatever the hell is necessary to do<br />when you are somewhere that you don’t understand,</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.610" end="00:08:51.540" style="s2">and because you don’t know what that thing<br />is going to be, all your systems go on, and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.540" end="00:08:56.130" style="s2">when psychologists talk about stress, which<br />is an abysmal word, right, it means everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.130" end="00:09:01.510" style="s2">and nothing, when psychologists talk about<br />stress, what they mean is, generalized disinhibition</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.510" end="00:09:02.740" style="s2">of emotion and motivation</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.740" end="00:09:09.740" style="s2">so then you come to the case of ancient Egypt<br />And one of the things Eliade points out, which</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.550" end="00:09:15.310" style="s2">I think is really interesting, I mean really<br />phenomenal, the story I’m going to tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.310" end="00:09:21.529" style="s2">you right now was essentially revealed in<br />Egyptian culture at the dawn of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.529" end="00:09:26.380" style="s2">rather than developing over the course of<br />the culture. So the Egyptians had a revelation,</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.380" end="00:09:32.260" style="s2">right, immediately that the most fundamental<br />of gods was the one who created as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.260" end="00:09:39.260" style="s2">of his tongue and his speech, very much akin<br />to the Sumerian idea with regards to Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.300" end="00:09:43.459" style="s2">and also to later Judao-Christian ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.459" end="00:09:49.320" style="s2">so here’s the story. There’s four players<br />in this drama, OK? There’s Osiris, his wife</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.320" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">Isis, Horace their son, and Seth. And Seth<br />is Osiris’ evil brother, OK? Now Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.220" end="00:10:05.740" style="s2">was a remarkable guy. He was the founder of<br />the Egyptian state from the mythological perspective,</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.740" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">so kind of like Romulus and Remus for Rome,<br />a myth or like George Washington for the U.S.,</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:16.660" style="s2">right? A mythologized figure who represented<br />all of the Pharaohs and people for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.660" end="00:10:18.760" style="s2">who’d actually constructed the Egyptian<br />state.</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.760" end="00:10:23.720" style="s2">Osiris, father of Egypt, so to speak, but<br />Osiris is kind of old and a little archaic</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.720" end="00:10:28.690" style="s2">and maybe a little bit senile and even possibly<br />a little bit naïve in that you know even</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.690" end="00:10:33.730" style="s2">no matter how great you were in your youth,<br />as time goes on you lose contact with environmental</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.730" end="00:10:38.649" style="s2">transformations and the old rules that you<br />lived by are not necessarily applicable to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.649" end="00:10:43.339" style="s2">the present and some of those things that<br />you ignore become paramount in importance.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.339" end="00:10:48.910" style="s2">And it turns out that Osiris has an evil brother,<br />Seth, and Seth eventually turns into Satan</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.910" end="00:10:55.649" style="s2">as mythology develops through the centuries.<br />And Seth is a nasty guy, right, I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.649" end="00:11:02.190" style="s2">he wants more than anything is undeserved<br />dominion over the Egyptian state. Now Osiris,</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.190" end="00:11:06.709" style="s2">because he’s not paying attention and because<br />he isn’t sufficiently cognizant anymore</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.709" end="00:11:13.709" style="s2">of the power of evil, more or less ignores<br />his evil brother, who in turn chops him into</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.290" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">pieces and then distributes his pieces all<br />over the Egyptian state. Now you might say:</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:26.699" style="s2">why didn’t he just kill him, right? I mean<br />you’d think chopping him up would kill him</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.699" end="00:11:31.630" style="s2">but he’s a god, you can’t just kill them.<br />The reason in mythology, and you see this</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.630" end="00:11:35.759" style="s2">in movies as well, where the villain never<br />quite dies or the hero never quite dies, is</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.759" end="00:11:41.339" style="s2">because even if you eliminate individual embodiments<br />of what those figures represent, new embodiments</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.339" end="00:11:45.160" style="s2">manifest themselves virtually immediately.<br />So one of the things mythology is quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.160" end="00:11:50.110" style="s2">about is that you never win a final battle<br />with evil. It’s a permanent property of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.110" end="00:11:56.360" style="s2">the world.</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.360" end="00:12:02.550" style="s2">So anyways, Seth hacks up Osiris, spreads<br />him all over the land. Osiris ends up living</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.550" end="00:12:07.699" style="s2">a kind of shadowy and nebulous ghost-like<br />existence down in the underworld and Seth</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.699" end="00:12:14.699" style="s2">becomes the ruler of the state. A nasty story.<br />Alright, but Osiris has Isis as a wife. Now</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:22.519" style="s2">Isis had a huge cult. She was a powerful goddess,<br />goddess of the under world, a kind of combination</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.199" end="00:12:28.680" style="s2">of Kali and Diana, so to speak, capable of<br />tremendous destructive power but also the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.680" end="00:12:35.139" style="s2">source of all good things – something very<br />much like Tiamat. Now Isis got wind of her</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.139" end="00:12:42.009" style="s2">husband’s disintegration, so to speak, and<br />she went searching around Egypt till she found</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.009" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">his phallus and with it she makes herself<br />pregnant.</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">OK, so what does that mean exactly? It means<br />something like this. The collapse of any great</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:59.880" style="s2">order brings with it new potential and I think<br />this is something that capitalism has way</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:07.800" style="s2">over forms of government like communism. Capitalism<br />has mechanisms in place to allow large structures</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.250" end="00:13:14.130" style="s2">that are no longer meeting their function<br />to collapse. But frequently when they collapse,</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.130" end="00:13:19.310" style="s2">it’s not like they disintegrate into dust,<br />right, they disintegrate into sub-components,</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.310" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">so to speak, many of which then come to terms<br />with the fact that the order has collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:29.569" style="s2">and build something new. So you can’t get<br />rid of culture so easily. You can hack it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.569" end="00:13:33.899" style="s2">up into bits, you can disembody it, so to<br />speak, you can spread it all over the state,</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.899" end="00:13:40.440" style="s2">you can introduce chaos into it. But that’s<br />something that has the potential of new birth</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.440" end="00:13:45.850" style="s2">like the phoenix rising from the ashes.<br />So anyways, Isis, who’s the matrix, who’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.850" end="00:13:52.850" style="s2">Tiamat, gets Osiris’ phallus, which is the<br />container of the germ of culture, right, the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.139" end="00:13:59.149" style="s2">phenomenon that’s capable of the seminal<br />idea, and she makes herself pregnant and she</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.149" end="00:14:04.029" style="s2">gives birth to Horace, who’s the long-lost<br />son of the rightful king, right, a very typical</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.029" end="00:14:11.029" style="s2">mythological motif. OK, so Horace is alienated<br />from the kingdom, which is another very common</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.759" end="00:14:16.550" style="s2">mythological motif, you know like how King<br />Arthur, for example, is raised by commoners?</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.550" end="00:14:22.610" style="s2">The same story pops up in the story for Christ,<br />for example, because Christ has heavenly parents</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.610" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">but then he also has kind of ordinary parents<br />and it’s a very common motif. Anyways, so</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:34.440" style="s2">Horace grows up outside of the classical structure<br />of the Egyptian state, which is tilted terribly</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.139" end="00:14:41.430" style="s2">towards evil because Seth has dominated, because<br />Osiris was too blind to his evil brother to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.430" end="00:14:46.129" style="s2">take appropriate defensive actions, and he<br />grows to maturity. And then he decides, like</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.129" end="00:14:52.100" style="s2">all rightful sons of the long-lost king, to<br />reclaim his heritage. So he goes back to Egypt,</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.100" end="00:14:58.500" style="s2">right, and he has this vicious battle with<br />Seth and in the process, Seth tears out one</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.500" end="00:15:04.379" style="s2">of his eyes. Well, fine, and that’s an indication<br />of just exactly how devastating a battle with</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.379" end="00:15:09.940" style="s2">the forces of evil, so to speak, precisely<br />are. They represent a critical threat to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.940" end="00:15:14.370" style="s2">integrity of consciousness, right? That’s<br />why he loses an eye. Well, luckily enough,</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.370" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">Horace has got his act together and he does<br />defeat Seth and he banishes him and he gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:25.800" style="s2">the eye back. And then you think: OK, great,<br />pop the eye back in, become emperor, everything’s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.379" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:30.860" style="s2">Now let’s backtrack a little bit and think<br />about this politically. Now the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.860" end="00:15:37.319" style="s2">had this really weird idea. They had the idea<br />that the living pharaoh was the living pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.319" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">and the dead pharaoh at the same time. makes<br />no sense rationally but it makes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:45.730" style="s2">sense from a narrative perspective because<br />what they were saying is something like this:</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.730" end="00:15:50.209" style="s2">look, you got to think that when you become<br />king, or when you become president, or when</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.209" end="00:15:55.620" style="s2">you take on a role of that absolute magnitude,<br />that then you’re partly you but you’re</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.620" end="00:15:59.720" style="s2">also partly this role and there’s really<br />no way out of that, right? And the role is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.720" end="00:16:04.699" style="s2">composed of the unbelievable weight of the<br />cultural tradition that you’re representing.</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.699" end="00:16:08.540" style="s2">And you can say: well, that’s true for being<br />king or for being president but it’s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.540" end="00:16:13.160" style="s2">true if you become a doctor or a lawyer, any<br />sort of specialized occupation. It’s partly</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.160" end="00:16:17.790" style="s2">you, because you’re embodying the role,<br />but it’s partly the role too. So the pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.790" end="00:16:22.899" style="s2">is the live pharaoh and the dead pharaoh because<br />the dead pharaoh represents culture, right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.899" end="00:16:25.779" style="s2">The king is dead, long live the king.</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.779" end="00:16:31.029" style="s2">OK, but paralleling that idea was the idea<br />that the pharaoh was not only the dead pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.029" end="00:16:34.829" style="s2">and the live pharaoh at the same time but<br />that he was Osiris and Horace at the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.829" end="00:16:40.779" style="s2">time. But then you think in the story, Horace<br />has taken over Seth, he’s got his eye back,</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.779" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">he can be king. But he isn’t king yet and<br />this is where the Egyptians really get their</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:50.120" style="s2">act together and I think, of the two stories<br />that I’m telling you, this is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.120" end="00:16:54.889" style="s2">has the most significance, I think, for modern<br />people because we’re so likely to sidestep</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.889" end="00:17:00.759" style="s2">our obligation to our culture, whatever that<br />happens to be. So instead of popping this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.759" end="00:17:04.310" style="s2">eye back in his head, which is the first thing<br />you’d think he does, he decides he’s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.310" end="00:17:09.060" style="s2">to go back to the underworld, where Osiris<br />is living in this ghostlike and dead manner,</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.060" end="00:17:13.100" style="s2">since he’s been chopped up by Seth. So he<br />goes down into the underworld, which is no</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.100" end="00:17:17.689" style="s2">piece of cake, and he finds Osiris there in<br />this kind of half-dead state and he gives</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.689" end="00:17:24.689" style="s2">him his eye. And that enlightens Osiris, right,<br />it gives him vision and so then he takes Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.090" end="00:17:33.810" style="s2">back to Egypt arm in arm, so to speak. And<br />it’s the conjunction of Osiris and Horace</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.810" end="00:17:38.950" style="s2">that constitutes the basis for Egyptian sovereignty<br />and that is bloody brilliant, right, because</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.950" end="00:17:44.620" style="s2">the Egyptians figured out that so Horace is<br />Marduk, for all intents and purposes, right?</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.620" end="00:17:50.810" style="s2">He’s this avenging hero. In the Egyptian<br />story, he fights political corruption rather</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.810" end="00:17:55.420" style="s2">than chaos but you can understand that those<br />are two flipsides of the hero archetype, they</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.420" end="00:17:55.900" style="s2">are.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.900" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">The hero archetype has two basic elements.<br />One is the confrontation of the terrible aspect</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:07.700" style="s2">of nature, chaos in its most brutal form,<br />and the other is the confrontation with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.700" end="00:18:12.290" style="s2">archaic aspect of culture. And in some ways,<br />those aren’t distinguishable because if</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.290" end="00:18:18.490" style="s2">culture isn’t archaic, chaos never makes<br />itself present. So which is to say you can’t</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.490" end="00:18:25.490" style="s2">separate out political degradation from environmental<br />degradation, say, it’s the same idea.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.690" end="00:18:33.190" style="s2">So anyways, Horace has this great idea. He<br />needs his father, right, and I told you about</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.190" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">the same motif emerging in Pinocchio, we already<br />looked at that, right? Pinocchio doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:43.450" style="s2">become genuine until he risks his life saving<br />his father, alright, so the same thing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.450" end="00:18:47.450" style="s2">happening in this particular situation. So<br />that’s pretty cool. So then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.450" end="00:18:53.030" style="s2">situation where the Egyptians characterize<br />sovereignty as the capability to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.030" end="00:18:58.590" style="s2">evil in the political domain, combined with<br />– and that’s a youthful capability, right</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.590" end="00:19:03.890" style="s2">– combined with the wisdom of the past,<br />alright? Then you look at that from a political</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.890" end="00:19:08.930" style="s2">perspective and you find out already that<br />the Egyptians viewed the pharaoh as the live</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.930" end="00:19:10.870" style="s2">pharaoh and the dead pharaoh simultaneously.</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.870" end="00:19:14.620" style="s2">But then you find out something else that’s<br />interesting and it gives you some real insight</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.620" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2">into just exactly how bloody powerful these<br />ideas were. So you think: what did the Egyptians</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:24.300" style="s2">do with their spare time? And then you think:<br />well, they built the pyramids, right, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.300" end="00:19:30.790" style="s2">and that was no trivial undertaking. It was<br />sort of the 5000 B.C. equivalent of flying</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.790" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">to Mars. And I mean the pyramids are pretty<br />impressive now but they were a hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:39.500" style="s2">more impressive in their original form because<br />they were in the middle of an immense complex.</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.500" end="00:19:45.370" style="s2">And the pyramids were dedicated to the immortality<br />of the pharaoh and the pharaoh was possessed</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.370" end="00:19:51.870" style="s2">by a spirit called Ka and Ka was his immortal<br />spirit and it was the union of Horace and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:52.450" style="s2">Osiris, OK?</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.450" end="00:19:59.450" style="s2">So Egyptian society was dedicated to deifying<br />the immortal spirit of the pharaoh, the union</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.690" end="00:20:07.590" style="s2">of Horace and Osiris. And it was the union<br />that gave the, it was this identification</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.590" end="00:20:14.310" style="s2">with this union that gave the pharaoh a phenomenon<br />the Egyptians called Maat and Maat was like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.310" end="00:20:19.750" style="s2">truth or good order. And you could think about<br />it as conscience in a sense is if the pharaoh</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.750" end="00:20:26.750" style="s2">was utilizing the union of Horace and Osiris,<br />then he would have an intuitive ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.980" end="00:20:33.210" style="s2">decide what the appropriate course of order<br />was. And so the Egyptians would say, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.210" end="00:20:37.010" style="s2">when the pharaoh came into the court, they’d<br />say: the sun has risen by that they meant</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.010" end="00:20:42.530" style="s2">the power that reigned over the dominion of<br />the night had arrived. They conceptualized</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.530" end="00:20:49.530" style="s2">maat as the capacity to put order in the place<br />of chaos, essentially formally. So they assimilated</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.540" end="00:20:54.130" style="s2">the union of Horace and Osiris with the capability<br />of putting order in the face of chaos. They</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.130" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">regarded that as immortal and they spent all<br />of the excess resources of their society glorifying</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:04.990" style="s2">that idea. And you think: you don’t produce<br />something like the pyramids without really</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.990" end="00:21:10.360" style="s2">being possessed by an idea, right? This is<br />no trivial undertaking, it’s going over</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.360" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">a period of several hundred, if not several<br />thousand, years. That takes an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.250" end="00:21:19.480" style="s2">work. So this idea of the immortality of the<br />union of Horace and Osiris and its association</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.480" end="00:21:23.830" style="s2">with sovereignty was an absolutely potent<br />idea for the Egyptians. It gave their whole</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.830" end="00:21:25.590" style="s2">culture motive force.</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.590" end="00:21:30.810" style="s2">OK, so the Egyptians thought: the pharaoh<br />is immortal and that’s the reason why and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.810" end="00:21:34.750" style="s2">we more or less partake in his immortality<br />by being his subjects. So that was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.750" end="00:21:40.030" style="s2">good deal. But then Eliade points out something<br />very interesting and this is called the democratization</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.030" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">of Osiris and what you found was that initially<br />there were certain symbolic presentations</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:50.260" style="s2">representing the immortality of the pharaoh<br />that could only be used by the pharaoh. But</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.260" end="00:21:56.690" style="s2">as Egyptian culture continued to develop,<br />then the symbolic representations of immortality</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.690" end="00:22:03.690" style="s2">started to be adopted by the aristocracy.<br />Now what did that mean? It meant that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.040" end="00:22:11.040" style="s2">process that the Egyptians had conceptualized<br />as integral to the order of the state was</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.270" end="00:22:16.550" style="s2">no longer solely embodied in the hands of<br />the pharaoh, right? It had started to drift</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.550" end="00:22:22.470" style="s2">down the power hierarchy into the aristocracy,<br />OK? Well then you think: what happens after</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.470" end="00:22:28.890" style="s2">that? So by the end of Egyptian society, the<br />aristocrats were characterized by an identity</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.890" end="00:22:33.620" style="s2">with the union of Horace and Osiris, right?<br />Sovereignty had started to spread itself out.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.620" end="00:22:38.910" style="s2">And you think: what starts to happen with<br />the Greeks, right? The Greeks attribute sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.910" end="00:22:44.700" style="s2">to every male Greek. Barbarians, no. Women,<br />no. But at least all males, right? You get</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.700" end="00:22:48.780" style="s2">a beginning of a democratic notion there.</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.780" end="00:22:55.780" style="s2">The Jews developing ideas that, if not derived<br />from Egypt, were at least similar in structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:05.240" style="s2">to Egyptian ideas, say: not the aristocracy,<br />not the pharaoh but every individual has the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.070" end="00:23:12.850" style="s2">capacity of establishing a direct relationship<br />with the transcendent deity, right? Then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.850" end="00:23:17.910" style="s2">have a Christian revolution that follows that<br />where the idea that sovereignty inheres in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.910" end="00:23:23.350" style="s2">the individual, is distributed to everyone,<br />right, everyone – male, female, criminal,</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.350" end="00:23:29.420" style="s2">non-criminal, murderer, rapist, taxman, you<br />name it, sovereignty inheres within them.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.420" end="00:23:35.640" style="s2">And it’s on that soil that our whole democratic<br />culture emerges – these unbelievably archaic</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.640" end="00:23:41.240" style="s2">ideas, first acted out, right, first embodied<br />in ritual, first dramatized then only told</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.240" end="00:23:47.740" style="s2">as stories, developing more and more coherence<br />over stretches of time of thousands of years,</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.740" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">not hundreds of years but thousands of years,<br />becoming more coherent, becoming more pointed,</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">becoming more relevant with regards to their<br />embodiment, then starting to become understood</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:02.680" style="s2">explicitly and distributed to the entire society.</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.680" end="00:24:09.680" style="s2">And it’s on that ground that our world rests,<br />not on the ground of rationality, as established</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.420" end="00:24:19.420" style="s2">in say Europe in 1500. What we have is much<br />more profound and solid and deep than any</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.300" end="00:24:27.160" style="s2">mere rational construction. It’s a from<br />of government, an equilibrated state, so to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.160" end="00:24:34.160" style="s2">speak, that’s a consequence of an emergent,<br />if not evolutionary, at least social evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.930" end="00:24:39.980" style="s2">process. And I would say that it stems much<br />farther back than that because you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.980" end="00:24:46.980" style="s2">something like this. Look, if this ideal personality<br />that should be sovereign is represented by</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.420" end="00:24:52.670" style="s2">the optimal combination of creativity and<br />traditionalism, say, if that’s the optimal</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.670" end="00:24:59.010" style="s2">combination, and if we’re prepared to regard<br />that as optimal, if that’s a – if that’s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.010" end="00:25:04.490" style="s2">what you perceive when you perceive someone<br />that you respect and admire, then you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.490" end="00:25:10.540" style="s2">say that success in our social hierarchies<br />is predicated on the degree to which you actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.540" end="00:25:17.140" style="s2">embody that combination. And then you see<br />an interaction between individual success</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.140" end="00:25:21.620" style="s2">and the social construction that would be<br />an interaction that extends over centuries</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.620" end="00:25:27.660" style="s2">or even thousands of centuries so that as<br />these ideas become more and more developed,</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.660" end="00:25:33.930" style="s2">we become more and more adapted to embodying<br />them as a consequence of evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.930" end="00:25:36.550" style="s2">So it’s not just cultural, it’s also biological.</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.550" end="00:25:43.320" style="s2">So our political presuppositions rest on a<br />cultural basis which is unbelievably archaic,</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.320" end="00:25:48.660" style="s2">resting in turn on something even lower than<br />that. And I think examples of that are those</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.660" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">that I’ve provided you with already. We<br />know, for example, that chimps who have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:57.150" style="s2">live in a dominance hierarchy are very aggressive,<br />especially the males, but they’re also very</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.150" end="00:26:02.380" style="s2">cooperative. So the males who are aggressive<br />spend a substantial amount of time repairing</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.380" end="00:26:07.910" style="s2">social boundaries in the aftermath of an aggressive<br />incident because they’re just as concerned</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.910" end="00:26:14.160" style="s2">with keeping the bloody hierarchy intact as<br />they are in climbing it. They have to be.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.160" end="00:26:18.920" style="s2">And we know that even wolves won’t kill<br />a subordinate wolf once they’ve defeated</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.920" end="00:26:23.410" style="s2">it. They allow the subordinate wolf to maintain<br />its own existence, right, they have this notion,</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.410" end="00:26:30.330" style="s2">this procedural notion that – even those<br />entities that appear insignificant may, in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.330" end="00:26:35.650" style="s2">some manner that’s beyond speech, still<br />contribute to the integrity of the whole.</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.650" end="00:26:39.090" style="s2">And that’s an idea that’s very much similar<br />to our notion that sovereignty inheres in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.090" end="00:26:43.620" style="s2">the individual, right? We’ve taken it further.<br />No matter what you do, even if you’re in</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.620" end="00:26:48.360" style="s2">clear violation of the law, your rights remain<br />intact because no matter how outcast you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.360" end="00:26:52.440" style="s2">and how apparently beyond redemption, your<br />existence may still contribute something to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.440" end="00:26:56.410" style="s2">the integrity of the whole. And as far as<br />I’m concerned, that doesn’t appear to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.410" end="00:27:02.360" style="s2">be a metaphorical idea. If you dismiss it,<br />you cannot dismiss it without simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:07.970" style="s2">dismissing the ground on which our states<br />rest. And so then you have to ask yourself:</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.970" end="00:27:13.180" style="s2">are you willing to do that? And if the answer<br />is no, well then you have to start to question</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.180" end="00:27:17.720" style="s2">what it is that you actually believe, because<br />if you buy the doctrine of natural rights,</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:24.420" style="s2">which you do, you act it out, then all of<br />this follows in its wake, or it rests on sand.</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.420" end="00:27:31.420" style="s2">And it bloody well better not rest on sand.</p>
