<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">knew what an email address was but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:02.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t have an email account so I called</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">a friend in Humboldt County I used to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.790" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">live in San Francisco and I said can you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">send an email message to this guy and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2">turns out he was only living three</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">blocks from me he had moved all the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">from the east as I did and was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:13.600" style="s2">living in my neighborhood I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:15.910" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.600" end="00:02:18.430" style="s2">so I asked him what is all this internet</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.910" end="00:02:20.380" style="s2">stuff and he filled me in and then he</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.430" end="00:02:22.510" style="s2">said you should get bored watch magazine</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.380" end="00:02:24.310" style="s2">so I walked up the street and amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.510" end="00:02:27.400" style="s2">on Fillmore Street in San Francisco at</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.310" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">the time a coffee shop was carrying</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.400" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">bored watch magazine Jack records old</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:34.990" style="s2">magazine and they were announcing their</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">1993 convention so I said I&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.990" end="00:02:38.380" style="s2">I&#39;ll go and see what that&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">and I went and I was there with hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.380" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">and hundreds of online obsessed people</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:46.780" style="s2">my first real exposure to that world</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:48.610" style="s2">I met mark Graham who figured very</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.780" end="00:02:50.830" style="s2">importantly in my education and in all</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.610" end="00:02:52.390" style="s2">things internet in those days and I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.830" end="00:02:54.880" style="s2">this revelation that the world was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.390" end="00:02:56.320" style="s2">change soon dramatically and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.880" end="00:02:58.600" style="s2">little notebook with mice you know one</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.320" end="00:03:00.670" style="s2">of those marble eyes notebooks with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.600" end="00:03:02.110" style="s2">know 180 pages or whatever and by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.670" end="00:03:04.270" style="s2">time I&#39;d finished the four-day</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.110" end="00:03:06.670" style="s2">conference I&#39;d filled it with ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.270" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">I said this is what I&#39;m gonna devote</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.670" end="00:03:14.850" style="s2">myself to for the next couple years</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">that&#39;s how I got started 1993</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.850" end="00:03:20.350" style="s2">absolutely absolutely I&#39;ll disclose this</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:22.840" style="s2">right now I&#39;m a technical klutz I was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.350" end="00:03:26.440" style="s2">tech writer I did write apparently the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.840" end="00:03:27.850" style="s2">first manual for an ISDN modem for was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.440" end="00:03:30.340" style="s2">company that was in San Francisco</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.850" end="00:03:31.510" style="s2">downtown they had their Hayes Hayes had</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.340" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">its high-end</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.510" end="00:03:35.590" style="s2">cutting-edge engineering office in San</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:38.170" style="s2">Francisco and I was a tech writer and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.590" end="00:03:40.630" style="s2">I got the assignment contract to go down</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.170" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">and write there is DN manual so I kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.630" end="00:03:45.010" style="s2">of knew technical things but I never was</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:47.080" style="s2">comfortable with them and so when my</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.010" end="00:03:49.740" style="s2">boss said hey I want you to get a modem</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.080" end="00:03:52.030" style="s2">so he can send stuff back and forth I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.740" end="00:03:54.790" style="s2">refused because I didn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.030" end="00:03:57.100" style="s2">intruded upon so it&#39;s just it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.790" end="00:03:59.770" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.100" end="00:04:01.210" style="s2">of my technical prowess that probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.770" end="00:04:03.100" style="s2">made you a good internet marketing guy</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.210" end="00:04:05.170" style="s2">not one of these guys was overly</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.100" end="00:04:07.480" style="s2">enamored of the shiny little objects</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.170" end="00:04:09.940" style="s2">funny you mentioned Hayes you know I go</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:11.860" style="s2">back to their early days 1980 at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.940" end="00:04:14.110" style="s2">source which was one of the very big in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.860" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">fact it was the first consumer online</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.110" end="00:04:19.750" style="s2">internet service and actually worked</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">there and I met Dennis Hayes at for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.750" end="00:04:23.710" style="s2">Consumer Electronics Show in 1981 where</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:26.620" style="s2">he was selling is there</p>

<p begin="00:04:26.620" end="00:04:30.490" style="s2">into the backplane of the Apple II he</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.270" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">couldn&#39;t spell with the CES would he</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.490" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">have a little Carter table and I then</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.130" end="00:04:37.300" style="s2">went out and met him in the parking lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:40.060" style="s2">he sold me a very early version of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.300" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">DC Haze Apple modem out of the back of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">the trunk of his car for $300 cash money</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.610" end="00:04:50.889" style="s2">that&#39;s how we used to do it I I bought I</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.560" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">bought a very early CRM customer</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.889" end="00:04:57.580" style="s2">relations management software program in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:05:01.000" style="s2">1992 from a guy from the back from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.580" end="00:05:02.889" style="s2">trunk of his car literally mr. Rose I</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.000" end="00:05:06.759" style="s2">kept members first name but while he was</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.889" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">a visionary yeah you came on board right</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.759" end="00:05:12.250" style="s2">about the time the internet started to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:14.440" style="s2">go early early early mainstream 1993</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.250" end="00:05:17.710" style="s2">what makes that significant is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.440" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">when the mosaic web browser by Marc</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.710" end="00:05:26.139" style="s2">Andreessen was released by University of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:29.349" style="s2">Illinois the Illinois yeah NCSA right</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.139" end="00:05:31.060" style="s2">and I noticed you also know mark a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.349" end="00:05:34.599" style="s2">little bit mark and I became friends</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.060" end="00:05:36.729" style="s2">when he was CTO at AOL later ah okay but</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.599" end="00:05:38.740" style="s2">when I was also you know just down the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.729" end="00:05:40.659" style="s2">road we hit it off pretty well so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.740" end="00:05:43.719" style="s2">was kind of cool but anyway that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.659" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">the internet became accessible to normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.719" end="00:05:48.969" style="s2">people before that it was character mode</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:51.550" style="s2">only things like telnet and gopher and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.969" end="00:05:54.130" style="s2">FTP you probably didn&#39;t have to do all</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.550" end="00:05:55.960" style="s2">day of that right no I actually did</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.130" end="00:05:58.210" style="s2">I actually learned that stuff because 93</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.960" end="00:06:00.580" style="s2">you know the browser I&#39;d seen the mosaic</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:03.820" style="s2">browser in the summer of 93 in August</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.580" end="00:06:07.719" style="s2">but you know it was through still a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.820" end="00:06:09.669" style="s2">of text being used you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.719" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">another thing that happened around 93</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.669" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">give or take a few months that was also</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:17.409" style="s2">very important that was when internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:20.250" style="s2">email became ubiquitous in other words</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.409" end="00:06:24.130" style="s2">all the services finally by that point</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.250" end="00:06:26.259" style="s2">made internet email available to to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.130" end="00:06:29.259" style="s2">users so CompuServe I think was the very</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.259" end="00:06:30.729" style="s2">first to do that prodigy and then of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.259" end="00:06:32.169" style="s2">course all the little bulletin boards</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.729" end="00:06:34.449" style="s2">which which played I think a really</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.169" end="00:06:36.469" style="s2">important unheralded role in in in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.449" end="00:06:40.129" style="s2">adoption of the online world</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.469" end="00:06:43.069" style="s2">but by 93 pretty much everybody that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.129" end="00:06:45.800" style="s2">on any kind of an online system could</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.069" end="00:06:47.989" style="s2">mail to anybody else on an online system</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.800" end="00:06:49.909" style="s2">I meant to to younger people that may</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.989" end="00:06:52.099" style="s2">seem like not a big deal but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.909" end="00:06:54.319" style="s2">realize before the internet online</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.099" end="00:06:55.069" style="s2">systems were island so if you were on</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.319" end="00:06:56.869" style="s2">CompuServe</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.069" end="00:06:59.649" style="s2">you could communicate with people on</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.869" end="00:07:02.239" style="s2">CompuServe and no one else</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.649" end="00:07:04.699" style="s2">absolutely the walled garden they called</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.239" end="00:07:07.610" style="s2">it yeah yeah the the source was a well</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.699" end="00:07:09.289" style="s2">garden CompuServe AOL you kind of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.610" end="00:07:11.659" style="s2">because I do remember that transition</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.289" end="00:07:14.689" style="s2">point before I went on to the air</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.659" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">Internet by about 93 or 94 although I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.689" end="00:07:18.409" style="s2">been dabbling on it since 1990</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:20.179" style="s2">but I had email addresses on things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.409" end="00:07:24.709" style="s2">that CompuServe I still remember it it</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.179" end="00:07:26.419" style="s2">was seven one four 10.3 right where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.709" end="00:07:28.309" style="s2">that email go I should send an email to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.419" end="00:07:31.129" style="s2">that dress see what happens and I had it</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.309" end="00:07:33.050" style="s2">brought at aol.com this morning me and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.129" end="00:07:37.699" style="s2">my cousin would always see who could get</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.050" end="00:07:39.679" style="s2">Jim rut first on any service so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.699" end="00:07:41.059" style="s2">kind of a fun little game we played but</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.679" end="00:07:43.689" style="s2">yeah those back too that&#39;s right for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.059" end="00:07:46.669" style="s2">audience before about 93 there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.689" end="00:07:48.199" style="s2">really a whole series Islands and also</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.669" end="00:07:50.179" style="s2">at about that time ninety in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.199" end="00:07:52.669" style="s2">were doing it 93 the company I worked at</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.179" end="00:07:54.669" style="s2">was just implementing it corporate email</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.669" end="00:07:56.689" style="s2">was typically on lands and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.669" end="00:07:58.879" style="s2">interconnected land so it only worked</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.689" end="00:08:00.469" style="s2">within your corporation so I could send</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.879" end="00:08:02.689" style="s2">a letter to a co-worker but I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.469" end="00:08:06.589" style="s2">send an email to you know a customer</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.689" end="00:08:07.789" style="s2">even in 1996 right by 1993 the gateways</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.589" end="00:08:10.189" style="s2">had been built and it was fairly</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.789" end="00:08:12.919" style="s2">straightforward to send your internal</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.189" end="00:08:15.079" style="s2">mail from your mail servers which were</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.919" end="00:08:16.489" style="s2">expensive and hard to keep running out</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.079" end="00:08:18.079" style="s2">into the internet it was very</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.489" end="00:08:20.719" style="s2">interesting you&#39;re very right that was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.079" end="00:08:22.939" style="s2">that was the second important transition</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.719" end="00:08:25.939" style="s2">phase change as we would say in</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.939" end="00:08:28.759" style="s2">complexity science that occurred in 1993</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.939" end="00:08:32.389" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I have to say I put on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.759" end="00:08:34.309" style="s2">event in 94 and in this fall of 94 and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.389" end="00:08:37.550" style="s2">in the summer of 94 I was in building up</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.309" end="00:08:41.240" style="s2">interest for it and I was amazed at how</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.550" end="00:08:44.059" style="s2">many people in the digerati of San</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.240" end="00:08:46.309" style="s2">Francisco as late as the summer of 1994</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.059" end="00:08:48.920" style="s2">did not have email addresses on their</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.309" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">business card or email at all so so even</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.920" end="00:08:52.490" style="s2">though even though it was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">possible for everybody even people in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.490" end="00:08:56.510" style="s2">the business still hadn&#39;t it hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:08:58.520" style="s2">clicked with them in fact you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.510" end="00:09:00.649" style="s2">if we remember Wired magazine they</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.520" end="00:09:03.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t get hip to the internet until the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.649" end="00:09:06.170" style="s2">fall of 24 they didn&#39;t sing his praises</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.140" end="00:09:07.700" style="s2">or see it as a as an important</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.170" end="00:09:10.430" style="s2">initiative they just sort of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.700" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">something you know in the mix as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.430" end="00:09:16.070" style="s2">to the thing yeah and again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:17.720" style="s2">important for people have a historical</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.070" end="00:09:20.060" style="s2">mindset to remember that I mean today</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.720" end="00:09:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s all so pervasive it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.060" end="00:09:25.430" style="s2">believe that you know not that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.250" end="00:09:27.770" style="s2">really less than 30 years ago this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.430" end="00:09:29.240" style="s2">was just starting to happen yeah I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.770" end="00:09:31.339" style="s2">lots of connections into that world</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.240" end="00:09:32.870" style="s2">because I was a fairly early member of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.339" end="00:09:34.910" style="s2">something called the well the well</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.870" end="00:09:36.860" style="s2">cotton oh yeah of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.910" end="00:09:39.500" style="s2">Wow and I&#39;m still a member to this day</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.860" end="00:09:42.140" style="s2">believe it or not it still exists these</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.500" end="00:09:44.660" style="s2">I do like I do with Facebook now</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">typically take long breaks currently on</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.660" end="00:09:48.470" style="s2">about a year long break on the well but</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">I promise on my well friends I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.470" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">back this month well calm the best</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">conversation on the Internet no</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:59.209" style="s2">advertising and no abuse of your privacy</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:01.160" style="s2">so and you know that really was and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.209" end="00:10:02.779" style="s2">I guess still is but certainly was in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.160" end="00:10:06.529" style="s2">its heyday one of the most amazing</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.779" end="00:10:08.060" style="s2">salons on the planet I mean the number</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.529" end="00:10:11.230" style="s2">of fascinating people that were on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.060" end="00:10:13.459" style="s2">well back in the heyday was incredible I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.230" end="00:10:15.380" style="s2">was on the world tour not not super</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.459" end="00:10:17.000" style="s2">active you know one of my buddies with</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.380" end="00:10:21.380" style="s2">Jim Warren and we used to communicate a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.000" end="00:10:23.240" style="s2">lot Steve O&#39;Keefe yeah that was a great</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.380" end="00:10:25.550" style="s2">moment in history that well I have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.240" end="00:10:28.520" style="s2">say yeah and it&#39;s still going and while</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.550" end="00:10:32.060" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously not central like it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.520" end="00:10:33.980" style="s2">in 1991 it is still a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.060" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">place to hang out and it&#39;s ethical and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.980" end="00:10:37.220" style="s2">honorable you know high level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:39.950" style="s2">discourse all things we wish we&#39;d saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:42.709" style="s2">more of on the Internet these days so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.950" end="00:10:44.750" style="s2">we&#39;re you know we&#39;re both here 93 94</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.709" end="00:10:47.029" style="s2">when did you start to smell economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.750" end="00:10:48.529" style="s2">opportunity right away right away</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.029" end="00:10:50.180" style="s2">because I was in the direct mail</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.529" end="00:10:53.060" style="s2">business which meant I was used to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.180" end="00:10:56.420" style="s2">writing huge checks for postage for</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.060" end="00:10:58.459" style="s2">printing to mail houses and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.420" end="00:11:01.250" style="s2">that I could spend a communication to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.459" end="00:11:03.769" style="s2">customer for essentially free I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.250" end="00:11:06.889" style="s2">once I grasped that it boggled my mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.769" end="00:11:09.529" style="s2">my calculation was if just 10% of my</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.889" end="00:11:12.439" style="s2">customers get on this email thing I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.529" end="00:11:13.939" style="s2">save some money you know and I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.439" end="00:11:16.189" style="s2">able to communicate with that 10%</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.939" end="00:11:17.809" style="s2">segment more often that was my initial</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.189" end="00:11:19.850" style="s2">thought and then I started thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.809" end="00:11:22.549" style="s2">about things like FedEx packages you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.850" end="00:11:25.850" style="s2">know she I could just attach a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.549" end="00:11:27.350" style="s2">photographs to an email and send it for</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.850" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">free and get it there faster than in</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.350" end="00:11:32.839" style="s2">FedEx so just the simple savings in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:34.730" style="s2">communication immediately sold me my</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.839" end="00:11:35.929" style="s2">only question was was it gonna catch on</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.730" end="00:11:39.410" style="s2">it and I and I have to say when I went</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.929" end="00:11:41.809" style="s2">to that BBS con conference in in 93</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.410" end="00:11:45.259" style="s2">there was a panel and that the subject</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.809" end="00:11:47.959" style="s2">was can the internet be commercialized</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.259" end="00:11:49.160" style="s2">and it now hit it legally it was and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.959" end="00:11:50.779" style="s2">this is another thing we need to tell</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.160" end="00:11:52.970" style="s2">younger people or people that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.779" end="00:11:56.899" style="s2">the historical perspective it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.970" end="00:11:59.660" style="s2">legal to use the internet for commercial</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.899" end="00:12:04.610" style="s2">purposes until I have the date somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.660" end="00:12:06.319" style="s2">here sometime in 1989 1989 there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.610" end="00:12:08.329" style="s2">of argument about exactly what you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.319" end="00:12:10.249" style="s2">do web but that was about the time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.329" end="00:12:12.049" style="s2">so what that did was we had a whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.249" end="00:12:13.399" style="s2">generation of people that were involved</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.049" end="00:12:15.889" style="s2">in building the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.399" end="00:12:19.939" style="s2">with the attitude that this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.889" end="00:12:22.220" style="s2">commercial space so when an sfn I guess</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.939" end="00:12:24.709" style="s2">is their acronym said hey guess what</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.220" end="00:12:27.290" style="s2">guys you can do business now there were</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.709" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">crickets initially you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.290" end="00:12:31.999" style="s2">the culture of wheeling and dealing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:34.610" style="s2">buying and selling and promoting didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.999" end="00:12:36.559" style="s2">exist in the internet culture when that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.610" end="00:12:39.350" style="s2">when the laws were changed so there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.559" end="00:12:40.850" style="s2">a little bit of a gap before people like</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.350" end="00:12:43.490" style="s2">me showed up and said okay how can we</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.850" end="00:12:46.610" style="s2">make this thing work on a commercial</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.490" end="00:12:48.169" style="s2">basis and you&#39;re right I was again part</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.610" end="00:12:50.299" style="s2">of those discussions and you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.169" end="00:12:52.999" style="s2">right but then very interest in</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.299" end="00:12:55.220" style="s2">Intermezzo between the walled gardens of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.999" end="00:12:57.889" style="s2">Fayette CompuServe and AOL and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.220" end="00:12:59.720" style="s2">Internet there was this BBS world and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.889" end="00:13:01.129" style="s2">lot of the early people that got</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.720" end="00:13:03.079" style="s2">involved on the commercial side of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.129" end="00:13:05.480" style="s2">internet actually came out of the BBS</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.079" end="00:13:08.269" style="s2">world absolutely when it was they had</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.480" end="00:13:09.860" style="s2">the model you know subscribers and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.269" end="00:13:12.319" style="s2">know providing access to people</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.860" end="00:13:13.339" style="s2">providing content to people so all now</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.319" end="00:13:14.809" style="s2">that was a that was the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.339" end="00:13:17.730" style="s2">sold me when I went out to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.809" end="00:13:20.549" style="s2">conference in 93 and I saw the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.730" end="00:13:23.129" style="s2">that these folks had for the online</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.549" end="00:13:25.709" style="s2">experience I realized well if these</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.129" end="00:13:28.169" style="s2">people love it then this is a something</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.709" end="00:13:30.629" style="s2">that is possible for the nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.169" end="00:13:32.100" style="s2">of other people you know there was there</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.629" end="00:13:34.199" style="s2">was probably a time in fact I know there</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.100" end="00:13:38.009" style="s2">was a time when when movies were first</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.199" end="00:13:39.749" style="s2">invented and it took a while for people</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.009" end="00:13:42.419" style="s2">to get comfortable going to the movies</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.749" end="00:13:44.549" style="s2">there&#39;s reports of you know when the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.419" end="00:13:46.829" style="s2">train arrived on the screen some people</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.549" end="00:13:48.419" style="s2">would lose it and run out of the theater</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.829" end="00:13:50.220" style="s2">assuming they were about to be run over</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.419" end="00:13:52.980" style="s2">I heard another funny story recently</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.220" end="00:13:54.329" style="s2">about a Texas the early days of Texas</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.980" end="00:13:56.369" style="s2">and there was some bad guy doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.329" end="00:13:58.529" style="s2">something bad to a damsel in distress</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.369" end="00:14:00.239" style="s2">and some guy literally took a six-gun</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.529" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">out of his pocket and started shooting</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.239" end="00:14:05.730" style="s2">the screen so yeah so so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether a mediums gonna catch</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.730" end="00:14:10.019" style="s2">on or not you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s neuron</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.410" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">eclis or neurologically congruent with</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.019" end="00:14:14.579" style="s2">with human beings right but when I saw</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:16.470" style="s2">the passion that people had for sitting</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.579" end="00:14:19.049" style="s2">in front of screens and communicating</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.470" end="00:14:20.730" style="s2">and downloading and you know doing all</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.049" end="00:14:23.730" style="s2">the things they did I said well if if</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.730" end="00:14:27.029" style="s2">this little cadre of people is this into</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.730" end="00:14:28.799" style="s2">it then it&#39;s neurologically congruent</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.029" end="00:14:31.259" style="s2">for human beings and if it is the only</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.799" end="00:14:33.329" style="s2">barrier is to make this thing fast easy</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.259" end="00:14:35.519" style="s2">and cheap and then everybody&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.329" end="00:14:38.100" style="s2">on it you saw it you made one of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.519" end="00:14:40.679" style="s2">great life insights and you were right</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.100" end="00:14:42.839" style="s2">well oddly oddly enough where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.679" end="00:14:44.309" style="s2">know why this is because you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.839" end="00:14:45.959" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know how long</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.309" end="00:14:48.569" style="s2">humanity&#39;s been around but it&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.959" end="00:14:51.089" style="s2">time and suddenly in the last hundred</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.569" end="00:14:53.789" style="s2">and twenty years or 150 years we become</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.089" end="00:14:56.279" style="s2">screen Watchers you know first it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.789" end="00:14:57.629" style="s2">the movies and it was TV and I just</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.279" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">thought well this is just another</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.629" end="00:15:01.339" style="s2">version of screen watching and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:03.569" style="s2">apparently we are again neurologically</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.339" end="00:15:05.549" style="s2">congruent to sit in front of screens and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.569" end="00:15:06.600" style="s2">watch flickering lights you know it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.549" end="00:15:10.169" style="s2">might go all the way back to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.600" end="00:15:13.049" style="s2">campfire don&#39;t be telling a story right</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.169" end="00:15:14.100" style="s2">yeah you know and the things flashing</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.049" end="00:15:16.139" style="s2">and you know you&#39;re sort of sitting</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.100" end="00:15:20.339" style="s2">there looking at it I&#39;m gonna add that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.139" end="00:15:25.470" style="s2">to my possibly true but probably not</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.339" end="00:15:27.389" style="s2">hypotheses I can see it now okay before</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.470" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">we get into some of the early evolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.389" end="00:15:30.550" style="s2">of the commercial Internet they can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">useful for our audience</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.550" end="00:15:34.120" style="s2">who are mostly not marketing</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:36.250" style="s2">professionals to go into the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.120" end="00:15:38.980" style="s2">between brand advertising and marketing</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.250" end="00:15:41.200" style="s2">and direct response huh i SPECT walk</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.980" end="00:15:42.760" style="s2">mostly about direct response but might</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.200" end="00:15:44.589" style="s2">be useful to make that distinction for</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.760" end="00:15:47.110" style="s2">folks very good you hear the term</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.589" end="00:15:50.279" style="s2">branding a lot and and it certainly is</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.110" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">incredibly valuable to possess a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.279" end="00:15:56.470" style="s2">successful brand however building a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:59.260" style="s2">successful brand is a really really</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.470" end="00:16:02.230" style="s2">expensive process so that that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.260" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">consideration some brand advertising is</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.230" end="00:16:07.420" style="s2">to build the brand but a vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:09.850" style="s2">of brand advertising is to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.420" end="00:16:11.890" style="s2">brand so when you turn the TV on and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.850" end="00:16:13.510" style="s2">see generally funny we know if we see</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.890" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">Coke and Pepsi commercials anymore I</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.510" end="00:16:16.810" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen one in a while but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:18.519" style="s2">remember growing up there&#39;d be Coke and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.810" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">Pepsi commercials all the time they</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.519" end="00:16:23.649" style="s2">weren&#39;t selling you on the idea of soda</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:25.779" style="s2">or the idea of coke or the idea of Pepsi</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.649" end="00:16:28.209" style="s2">they were just reminding you so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.779" end="00:16:30.519" style="s2">when you were in the store and had the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.209" end="00:16:31.870" style="s2">choice to make you had the Pepsi theme</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.519" end="00:16:34.329" style="s2">running through your mind so you&#39;d grab</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.870" end="00:16:36.760" style="s2">Pepsi to me that&#39;s an example of brand</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.329" end="00:16:39.339" style="s2">advertising its saturation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.760" end="00:16:41.740" style="s2">expensive its unmeasurable to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.339" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">degree and and the whole point is just</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.740" end="00:16:47.589" style="s2">to get you when you&#39;re in the store</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:48.360" style="s2">looking at the shelf to remember that oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.589" end="00:16:51.149" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.360" end="00:16:53.950" style="s2">Pepsi is the thing or whatever the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.149" end="00:16:57.190" style="s2">slogan was direct response there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.950" end="00:17:00.490" style="s2">whole other kettle of fish it grew out</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.190" end="00:17:02.860" style="s2">of the catalog world of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.490" end="00:17:05.650" style="s2">it&#39;s measurable that&#39;s its most</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.860" end="00:17:07.720" style="s2">important feature you you run an ad you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.650" end="00:17:09.669" style="s2">know exactly how much the a drug cost</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.720" end="00:17:12.790" style="s2">you know exactly where it appeared and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.669" end="00:17:14.740" style="s2">because you can key the ad which is you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.790" end="00:17:16.329" style="s2">know change the order form slightly so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.740" end="00:17:18.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s unique to that particular ad</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.329" end="00:17:21.250" style="s2">in that placement you know exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.610" end="00:17:24.339" style="s2">many dollars you made back that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.250" end="00:17:27.429" style="s2">how closely they measure things and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.339" end="00:17:28.809" style="s2">allows a small business small being you</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.429" end="00:17:32.380" style="s2">know less than ten million dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.809" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">year to go out there and start selling</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.380" end="00:17:37.390" style="s2">you know actually book transactions you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:39.610" style="s2">know and it&#39;s a very very simple model</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.390" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">of dollars in dollars out I spent so</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.610" end="00:17:43.910" style="s2">much money on on the ad I got this many</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">orders you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.910" end="00:17:49.220" style="s2">you do a little calculation you think</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.590" end="00:17:51.950" style="s2">well I may not make a full profit on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.220" end="00:17:53.810" style="s2">first order but this is a repeat sale so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.950" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a lifetime value to the customer</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.810" end="00:17:59.030" style="s2">so yes I can keep running these ads so</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:18:03.110" style="s2">an infomercial is sort of a classic</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.030" end="00:18:05.450" style="s2">example of a direct response ad it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.110" end="00:18:07.580" style="s2">long ones long form they put down their</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.450" end="00:18:10.370" style="s2">money they buy the time they produce the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.580" end="00:18:12.260" style="s2">commercial and they run it as long as</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.370" end="00:18:13.550" style="s2">the phone rings and the phone rings</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.260" end="00:18:16.040" style="s2">profitably they will run that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.550" end="00:18:18.170" style="s2">infomercial forever the day it stops</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.040" end="00:18:19.580" style="s2">being profitable they stop running it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.170" end="00:18:21.620" style="s2">and try to come up with the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.580" end="00:18:24.470" style="s2">so I&#39;m from the direct-response world</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.620" end="00:18:25.880" style="s2">which is we measure everything because</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.470" end="00:18:27.590" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the budget of Coke or</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.880" end="00:18:30.230" style="s2">Pepsi so that&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.590" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">brand advertising in my mind and direct</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.230" end="00:18:34.490" style="s2">response advertising yep that makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:36.020" style="s2">perfect sense and I was also involved in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.490" end="00:18:38.360" style="s2">some businesses that generate a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.020" end="00:18:39.860" style="s2">surprising amount of dead trees back in</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.360" end="00:18:40.970" style="s2">the paper-based the direct response</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.860" end="00:18:42.620" style="s2">modeling world and you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.970" end="00:18:45.080" style="s2">right though the whole business was</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.620" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">about capturing up information to run</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:51.080" style="s2">matrix you were marketing to worked ramp</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.740" end="00:18:52.790" style="s2">up your dollars there and ramp down your</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.080" end="00:18:55.340" style="s2">dollars elsewhere and hopefully you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.790" end="00:18:57.980" style="s2">make a winner out of it exactly oh and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.340" end="00:18:59.530" style="s2">we both know what I at least once we</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.980" end="00:19:01.730" style="s2">figured out how to do it what a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.530" end="00:19:04.040" style="s2">revolution the Internet was so tell me</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.730" end="00:19:05.630" style="s2">about the very first thing you tried to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.040" end="00:19:10.970" style="s2">do commercially on the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.630" end="00:19:12.680" style="s2">Wow let me think I mean well I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.970" end="00:19:14.750" style="s2">of the things was promoting my events</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.680" end="00:19:18.050" style="s2">because I was putting on conferences in</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.750" end="00:19:20.420" style="s2">the Bay Area believe it or not it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.050" end="00:19:22.310" style="s2">very hard to convince people in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.420" end="00:19:24.920" style="s2">multi then called the multi media</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.310" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">industry who were the digerati of San</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.920" end="00:19:28.850" style="s2">Francisco at the time and it was very</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:30.890" style="s2">hard to convince people in the software</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.850" end="00:19:33.230" style="s2">industry just in the mainstream software</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.890" end="00:19:37.270" style="s2">industry that the internet offered any</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.230" end="00:19:39.980" style="s2">promise whatsoever and you know cd-roms</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.270" end="00:19:41.780" style="s2">everyone you know they&#39;re ubiquitous now</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.980" end="00:19:43.040" style="s2">they&#39;re no big deal we probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.780" end="00:19:44.780" style="s2">even use them anymore because we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.040" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">the Internet but there was a period</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.780" end="00:19:50.270" style="s2">before cd-roms were commercial items and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:52.420" style="s2">so you had this whole industry of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.270" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">in San Francisco that were custom making</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.420" end="00:19:56.580" style="s2">multimedia presentation so you know IBM</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:58.380" style="s2">needed some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.580" end="00:20:01.019" style="s2">sailes things so these guys would create</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.380" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">these laserdisc type things to that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.019" end="00:20:04.350" style="s2">salesman could either you know bring on</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:07.110" style="s2">the road or they could show at</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.350" end="00:20:08.610" style="s2">conferences so there was a big solid</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.110" end="00:20:11.309" style="s2">infrastructure of san francisco of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.610" end="00:20:15.090" style="s2">people that could make multimedia</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.309" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">interactive communications right they</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.090" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">did not for the for the most part what</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.580" end="00:20:23.070" style="s2">not is not fair to say half of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:24.659" style="s2">fully half of them did not get that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.070" end="00:20:26.789" style="s2">internet was going to be important to</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.659" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">their futures as late as the summer of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.789" end="00:20:31.169" style="s2">1994 right and you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:35.700" style="s2">things they would tell me is like well</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.169" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">i-i can&#39;t stream my multimedia over the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.700" end="00:20:39.029" style="s2">internet the band was too small so why</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:41.190" style="s2">would I even want to get involved in</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.029" end="00:20:43.320" style="s2">this and I just would you know slap my</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.190" end="00:20:44.909" style="s2">Fortis like I can&#39;t you see this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.320" end="00:20:47.100" style="s2">coming it&#39;s like it&#39;s so obvious I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.909" end="00:20:50.549" style="s2">a technical guy but my thought was</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.100" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">alright it&#39;s slow now but I see these</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.549" end="00:20:54.779" style="s2">motives are getting faster every season</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:57.630" style="s2">I think the technical guys can figure</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.779" end="00:21:00.059" style="s2">out how to make him even faster right I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.630" end="00:21:02.820" style="s2">mean it like I always think of like well</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.059" end="00:21:04.679" style="s2">they laid a cable from England to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.820" end="00:21:07.769" style="s2">United States on the floor of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.679" end="00:21:10.429" style="s2">Atlantic Ocean if they did that they can</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.769" end="00:21:12.750" style="s2">make you know modems move faster right</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.429" end="00:21:13.860" style="s2">how hard could it be I didn&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.750" end="00:21:16.590" style="s2">was gonna happen overnight</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.860" end="00:21:18.360" style="s2">but I saw it coming so that was my first</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.590" end="00:21:20.190" style="s2">businesses besides helping people you</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.360" end="00:21:22.350" style="s2">know do little things we had a hosting</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.190" end="00:21:26.490" style="s2">company we would build websites for</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.350" end="00:21:28.620" style="s2">people but my main business from 94 till</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.490" end="00:21:30.330" style="s2">2011 was teaching business people how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.620" end="00:21:32.370" style="s2">use this thing effectively so my first</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.330" end="00:21:35.220" style="s2">business ventures in the internet world</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.370" end="00:21:37.889" style="s2">were bringing the then Internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.220" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">commercialization experts together for</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.889" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">audiences and trying to explain guys</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.740" style="s2">this is what&#39;s coming this is how it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:45.179" style="s2">works this is how you might use it very</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.740" end="00:21:47.190" style="s2">interesting did you try to promote your</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.179" end="00:21:48.870" style="s2">own businesses other than how to take it</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.190" end="00:21:50.610" style="s2">almost seems recursive here I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.870" end="00:21:53.429" style="s2">internet marketing to market to people</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.610" end="00:21:55.110" style="s2">at each of internet marketing uses per</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.110" end="00:21:59.610" style="s2">real bullets like we sell a product sir</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">well I&#39;ve got a couple of websites that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.610" end="00:22:05.549" style="s2">I run now that kind of fit that model</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:07.950" style="s2">one is called jazz on the tube and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.549" end="00:22:09.950" style="s2">a service for people that love jazz and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.950" end="00:22:12.169" style="s2">everyday we put out a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.950" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">male pointing them to a jazz video we</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.169" end="00:22:17.990" style="s2">found and then we run advertising what</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:20.510" style="s2">else do we do we get we solicit support</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.990" end="00:22:22.399" style="s2">because as jazz fans are really into</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.510" end="00:22:24.169" style="s2">what they&#39;re into and they&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.399" end="00:22:25.700" style="s2">support the thing above and beyond you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.169" end="00:22:27.889" style="s2">know it&#39;s a free service but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.700" end="00:22:30.470" style="s2">we say hey kick in some money and lo and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.889" end="00:22:32.210" style="s2">behold they do yeah I sold my</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.470" end="00:22:33.529" style="s2">conference&#39;s online but it&#39;s just do</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.210" end="00:22:35.929" style="s2">enough in 94</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.529" end="00:22:37.730" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t bail the conference&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.929" end="00:22:40.760" style="s2">online because there weren&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.730" end="00:22:41.779" style="s2">people online to make it really work so</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.760" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">I had to do the selling the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.779" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">old-fashioned way I had to go to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">know Chamber of Commerce meetings I had</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:51.019" style="s2">to you know make alliances with with</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:53.870" style="s2">trade associations and mail to their</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.019" end="00:22:55.960" style="s2">mailing lists so my original efforts to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.870" end="00:22:59.690" style="s2">promote the Internet were mostly done</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.960" end="00:23:01.580" style="s2">offline the old-fashioned way remember</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.690" end="00:23:05.090" style="s2">that you know that was we all had to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.580" end="00:23:07.519" style="s2">because as you said you can&#39;t sell to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.090" end="00:23:09.860" style="s2">get people online online I mean the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.519" end="00:23:12.710" style="s2">famous example of that was the AOL</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.860" end="00:23:16.100" style="s2">cd-rom bombing of the world I mean run</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.710" end="00:23:18.200" style="s2">it literally billions of cd-roms that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.100" end="00:23:20.590" style="s2">they drop all over the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.200" end="00:23:22.940" style="s2">Europe to get early adopters on AOL</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.590" end="00:23:24.710" style="s2">right and that was kind of a direct mail</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.940" end="00:23:26.870" style="s2">play or direct marketing play for sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.710" end="00:23:28.549" style="s2">and they had assumed they did the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.870" end="00:23:30.889" style="s2">calculation that if we mail act</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.549" end="00:23:33.230" style="s2">thousands of discs we will get X</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.889" end="00:23:36.590" style="s2">hundreds of new subscribers each</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.230" end="00:23:38.419" style="s2">subscriber will be worth X and it will</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.590" end="00:23:39.950" style="s2">all work out in the end I happened to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.419" end="00:23:42.409" style="s2">meet the woman who actually came up with</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.950" end="00:23:44.200" style="s2">the idea for that campaign and she said</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.409" end="00:23:46.789" style="s2">yep they did some back of the envelope</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.200" end="00:23:48.649" style="s2">simple calculations but frankly they</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.789" end="00:23:50.600" style="s2">were so desperate to find something to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.649" end="00:23:53.029" style="s2">crack this conundrum that they just</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.600" end="00:23:55.070" style="s2">punted and went for it yeah committed a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.029" end="00:23:56.570" style="s2">fair amount of money they did not do</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.070" end="00:23:58.940" style="s2">what you and I would have done as our</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.570" end="00:24:01.100" style="s2">own startup entrepreneurs a shitload</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.940" end="00:24:03.139" style="s2">into the first shot and it did</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.100" end="00:24:05.480" style="s2">fortunately work then they got furious</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.139" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">about you know hardcore direct response</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:10.700" style="s2">marketing metrics yeah so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:13.850" style="s2">for a long time when did the AOL bombing</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.700" end="00:24:16.399" style="s2">occur look that up your online during</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.850" end="00:24:18.850" style="s2">the 90s you might even look for sugar</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.399" end="00:24:21.010" style="s2">than that even cd-rom</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.850" end="00:24:23.770" style="s2">well I I mean I remember AOL being so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.010" end="00:24:26.380" style="s2">small that I could write Steve Case and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.770" end="00:24:28.030" style="s2">he&#39;d write me back yeah yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.380" end="00:24:31.930" style="s2">they were pretty small in the early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.030" end="00:24:34.030" style="s2">here it said between 93 and 2006 AOL</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.930" end="00:24:38.470" style="s2">sent out more than a billion in the CD</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.030" end="00:24:40.570" style="s2">oh my god it was in the 90s and early</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.470" end="00:24:43.060" style="s2">double marks but as late as 2003 they</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.570" end="00:24:45.340" style="s2">were still doing the world like it used</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.060" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">to be a kind of a pop-culture stunt to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.340" end="00:24:48.700" style="s2">see what kind of cool things you could</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:51.130" style="s2">do one friend of mine took all the CD</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.700" end="00:24:52.750" style="s2">ROMs you&#39;d received from AOL and turned</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.130" end="00:24:55.420" style="s2">them into ornaments for his Christmas</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.750" end="00:24:57.250" style="s2">tree there you go yeah I mean somebody</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:05.680" style="s2">little rubber feet glued onto them so</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.670" end="00:25:06.910" style="s2">that was kind of interesting now the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.680" end="00:25:10.060" style="s2">other thing you talked about this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.910" end="00:25:13.330" style="s2">something I was tracking always was the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.060" end="00:25:17.140" style="s2">transition on what is it feasible to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.330" end="00:25:20.620" style="s2">online based on bandwidth and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.140" end="00:25:23.260" style="s2">earliest days a 1981 text was all you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.620" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">could do basically right yep that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.260" end="00:25:27.880" style="s2">images in the mid 80s and it was audio</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.340" style="s2">which you could do on a store and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.880" end="00:25:33.160" style="s2">forward basis but not real-time and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.340" end="00:25:35.230" style="s2">later 80s then it was real-time audio</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.160" end="00:25:37.870" style="s2">and there very early 90s then it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.230" end="00:25:39.730" style="s2">downloadable video or forget this little</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.870" end="00:25:41.500" style="s2">era where people would want to watch a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.730" end="00:25:43.780" style="s2">movie typically you&#39;d get it for free</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.500" end="00:25:48.220" style="s2">from some pirate site but it might take</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.780" end="00:25:51.250" style="s2">12 hour movie that&#39;s right the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.220" end="00:25:54.160" style="s2">days of pirate video sites were all a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.250" end="00:25:56.590" style="s2">non-real time and then finally you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.160" end="00:25:59.050" style="s2">streaming video finally came on and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.590" end="00:26:01.270" style="s2">remember what that logo that Netflix was</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.050" end="00:26:03.340" style="s2">in the business of sending out cd-rom</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.270" end="00:26:05.650" style="s2">yeah I remember that I do and I will</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.340" end="00:26:07.990" style="s2">give them credit amazing credit huge</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.650" end="00:26:10.210" style="s2">balls right is that what they knew that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.990" end="00:26:12.220" style="s2">the real play was streaming video but</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.210" end="00:26:14.020" style="s2">they decided to preempt that market</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.220" end="00:26:17.170" style="s2">place they would invest a bazillion</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.020" end="00:26:19.420" style="s2">dollars in owning the cd-rom mailing</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.170" end="00:26:21.040" style="s2">back and forth business which was an</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.420" end="00:26:23.170" style="s2">insane business to be in could never</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.040" end="00:26:24.190" style="s2">possibly make any money you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.170" end="00:26:26.680" style="s2">know how much they raised but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.190" end="00:26:29.049" style="s2">shitload to dominate that business and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.680" end="00:26:30.879" style="s2">there was a period when Walsh</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.049" end="00:26:32.529" style="s2">thought they were nuts and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.879" end="00:26:34.299" style="s2">transition wasn&#39;t going to happen fast</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.529" end="00:26:36.759" style="s2">enough for it all worker their stock</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.299" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">price collapsed I mean to a really low</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.759" end="00:26:40.600" style="s2">level if anybody bought the Netflix</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:42.970" style="s2">stock then they would have made a pile</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.600" end="00:26:44.710" style="s2">of dough but they were right and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.970" end="00:26:46.840" style="s2">rode that transition and now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.710" end="00:26:48.940" style="s2">probably the dominant entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.840" end="00:26:51.580" style="s2">company in the world or at least number</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.940" end="00:26:54.039" style="s2">two behind Disney which is amazing you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.580" end="00:26:56.169" style="s2">know considering how young a company</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.039" end="00:26:59.470" style="s2">they really are I know I remember the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.169" end="00:27:01.779" style="s2">Netflix of physical business was so big</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.470" end="00:27:04.359" style="s2">that in my little village where I live</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.779" end="00:27:07.749" style="s2">the post office decided to devote an</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.359" end="00:27:09.999" style="s2">entire window just to Netflix returns</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.749" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m not not a window but at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.999" end="00:27:13.090" style="s2">slot</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:15.100" style="s2">they had a Netflix lot because the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.090" end="00:27:16.779" style="s2">volume was incredible when that thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.100" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">was going and they acquired the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.779" end="00:27:20.529" style="s2">customers then when we all went online</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:22.539" style="s2">they had us now here&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.529" end="00:27:25.239" style="s2">gonna blow my blew my mind it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.539" end="00:27:27.429" style="s2">blow our audience&#39;s mind to Netflix</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.239" end="00:27:31.330" style="s2">didn&#39;t launch its streaming business</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.429" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">until 2010 Wow so it&#39;s only nine years</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.330" end="00:27:37.840" style="s2">old and already we have cultural memes</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:41.909" style="s2">like Netflix and chill man</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.840" end="00:27:45.249" style="s2">right it&#39;s only nine years old that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.909" end="00:27:47.080" style="s2">ridiculous yeah yeah I would have said</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.249" end="00:27:48.999" style="s2">it was older than that but nope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.080" end="00:27:51.789" style="s2">what wikipedia says and we know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.999" end="00:27:53.799" style="s2">not allowed to lie on Wikipedia huh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.789" end="00:27:55.450" style="s2">do you know there&#39;s a page speaking of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.799" end="00:27:58.749" style="s2">Wikipedia do you know there&#39;s a page on</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.450" end="00:28:02.139" style="s2">Wikipedia itself that states do not</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.749" end="00:28:04.659" style="s2">believe anything you see on Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.139" end="00:28:06.970" style="s2">and do not even use Wikipedia as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.659" end="00:28:09.850" style="s2">source about information about Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.970" end="00:28:12.100" style="s2">we&#39;re so unreliable it&#39;s on there so</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.850" end="00:28:14.259" style="s2">it&#39;s very funny of course there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.100" end="00:28:16.389" style="s2">some tests done in the last five years</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.259" end="00:28:18.759" style="s2">it showed that on average Wikipedia is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.389" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">more accurate than cyclopædia Britannica</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.759" end="00:28:22.869" style="s2">really yeah and it makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:24.879" style="s2">it&#39;s updated in real time to cross-check</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.869" end="00:28:27.070" style="s2">now of course it does not apply a highly</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.879" end="00:28:29.619" style="s2">controversial topic save the</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.570" end="00:32:14.950" style="s2">the fact that high net margin businesses</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.610" end="00:32:17.830" style="s2">are easier to direct response market</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.360" end="00:32:31.929" style="s2">can you charge ten times what it cost</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.220" end="00:32:34.750" style="s2">you to make well because I&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.549" end="00:32:44.410" style="s2">wrong I need that eight to ten time</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.590" end="00:32:46.270" style="s2">margin yeah at least six and a 60% gross</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.410" end="00:32:48.730" style="s2">margins the low the lowest I&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.270" end="00:32:50.290" style="s2">perfectly but I do love that 90% gross</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.730" end="00:32:52.330" style="s2">margin which is typical of amateur</p>

<p begin="00:36:52.110" end="00:36:56.280" style="s2">marketing you not so much about what you</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:26.850" style="s2">worth thinking about why that is well</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.660" end="00:37:28.230" style="s2">tennis players have one racquet maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.850" end="00:37:29.940" style="s2">they&#39;ll get a new one every now and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.230" end="00:37:31.800" style="s2">but they tend to like a particular</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.690" end="00:38:07.610" style="s2">reason the golfing community is willing</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.510" end="00:38:10.190" style="s2">to spend money on so if somebody went</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.610" end="00:38:12.980" style="s2">into business thinking they could make a</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.980" end="00:38:17.870" style="s2">got a tough road if they&#39;re going into</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.100" end="00:38:20.270" style="s2">business trying to sell to golfers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.870" end="00:38:21.830" style="s2">actually almost laughably easy I had a</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.300" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">ridiculously simple but I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.010" end="00:38:50.420" style="s2">another example that might help I had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:52.760" style="s2">student also in the martial arts arena</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.420" end="00:38:54.470" style="s2">he had been a college wrestler pretty</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.320" end="00:39:09.020" style="s2">reason was college wrestlers are not</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.020" end="00:39:10.970" style="s2">buyers they go to their workouts they</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.020" end="00:39:13.160" style="s2">listen to what the coach says they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.970" end="00:39:15.800" style="s2">not buying books and courses and tapes</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.160" end="00:39:17.210" style="s2">and going to conferences on how to be a</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.600" end="00:39:27.740" style="s2">figures at this point he was selling</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:46.840" style="s2">that block and you have to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.830" end="00:39:48.910" style="s2">kick and you have</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.350" end="00:40:11.620" style="s2">politically correct to sell that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.580" end="00:40:13.720" style="s2">magazine in public anymore you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.620" end="00:40:17.410" style="s2">it&#39;s loaded with direct response as why</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.720" end="00:40:19.120" style="s2">because they are ravenous buyers in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.410" end="00:40:20.500" style="s2">body and you get you get that first sale</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.120" end="00:40:22.840" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t screw it up you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.500" end="00:40:24.280" style="s2">many many more opportunities to sell</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.840" end="00:40:26.440" style="s2">them more and more and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.280" end="00:40:29.470" style="s2">thus building up the lifetime value of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.440" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">the customer thus raising the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.470" end="00:40:31.930" style="s2">money that you&#39;re able to spend on</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:33.820" style="s2">advertising which we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.930" end="00:40:37.180" style="s2">earlier in the call which is it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.820" end="00:40:39.460" style="s2">numbers in numbers out so so picking</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.180" end="00:40:42.460" style="s2">your picking your market is so important</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.460" end="00:40:46.570" style="s2">I go on to the I riff on this because if</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.460" end="00:40:49.930" style="s2">you look at Facebook what if how does</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.570" end="00:40:52.360" style="s2">Facebook start Facebook and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.930" end="00:40:53.560" style="s2">know there was no grand scheme it and by</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.360" end="00:40:55.780" style="s2">the way this is I think very important</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.560" end="00:40:58.660" style="s2">for everybody listening whose wants to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.780" end="00:41:00.190" style="s2">do something in life chances are when</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.660" end="00:41:01.720" style="s2">you&#39;re doing the best work that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.190" end="00:41:04.420" style="s2">that you&#39;re ever gonna do in your life</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.720" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">as you&#39;re doing it you&#39;re gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.420" end="00:41:07.720" style="s2">feeling that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:09.160" style="s2">doing and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.720" end="00:41:11.410" style="s2">and you&#39;re not sure where it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.160" end="00:41:12.670" style="s2">lead and it&#39;s only in retrospect that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:13.690" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna look back and go wow that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.670" end="00:41:15.730" style="s2">was brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.690" end="00:41:17.290" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve that&#39;s been my experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.730" end="00:41:18.970" style="s2">to life you know you find something</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.290" end="00:41:21.130" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in you love it you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.970" end="00:41:22.780" style="s2">give it your all it for some reason it</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.130" end="00:41:24.460" style="s2">captures your imagination yours</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.780" end="00:41:25.870" style="s2">practically she possibly can be while</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.460" end="00:41:28.150" style="s2">you&#39;re doing all that but you just dive</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.870" end="00:41:30.310" style="s2">in so what was Facebook well Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.150" end="00:41:32.680" style="s2">was well we had Facebook&#39;s in college</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.310" end="00:41:34.840" style="s2">most private colleges published a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.680" end="00:41:36.280" style="s2">physical Facebook literally because then</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.840" end="00:41:38.500" style="s2">young guys aren&#39;t going to know this but</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.280" end="00:41:40.390" style="s2">you derive as a freshman and they&#39;d give</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.500" end="00:41:42.940" style="s2">you a book and it had a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.390" end="00:41:44.500" style="s2">everybody in your class with a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.940" end="00:41:45.700" style="s2">where they went to school what clubs</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.500" end="00:41:46.330" style="s2">they were a member of and where they</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.700" end="00:41:48.810" style="s2">were from</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.330" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">so all that Facebook was was making that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.810" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">electronic that was a ravenous market</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:55.630" style="s2">you knew because of and I remember as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:57.100" style="s2">college student I was reading that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.630" end="00:41:58.690" style="s2">Facebook every night you know checking</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.100" end="00:42:00.049" style="s2">out the girls seeing yeah I wonder if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.690" end="00:42:01.699" style="s2">could meet this one</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.049" end="00:42:04.519" style="s2">so you already knew that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.699" end="00:42:07.009" style="s2">ravenous consumption for Facebook type</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.519" end="00:42:08.900" style="s2">information right so that was an</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.009" end="00:42:10.849" style="s2">accidental backing into an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.900" end="00:42:13.459" style="s2">market and then you know once once he</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.849" end="00:42:15.619" style="s2">got Harvard online you know he realized</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.459" end="00:42:17.630" style="s2">well my god I&#39;m in the and the Nexus as</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.619" end="00:42:19.160" style="s2">you know right Boston Cambridge I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.630" end="00:42:21.349" style="s2">you throw a rock and you&#39;re gonna hit</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.160" end="00:42:23.539" style="s2">twenty schools so he immediately</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.349" end="00:42:25.729" style="s2">networked all of Boston Cambridge that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.539" end="00:42:28.069" style="s2">whole area and then it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.729" end="00:42:30.019" style="s2">logical leap to go to all the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.069" end="00:42:31.789" style="s2">universities of the United States and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.019" end="00:42:34.699" style="s2">have a video somewhere in my archive of</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.510" end="00:44:36.900" style="s2">actually because the internet makes it</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.950" end="00:44:39.420" style="s2">so easy but back to the paper</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.900" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">direct-response days one that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.420" end="00:44:42.930" style="s2">pay a lot of attention to you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:45.869" style="s2">described as you must be able to easily</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.930" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">reach your market we used to rule out</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.869" end="00:44:49.890" style="s2">products basically called the needle and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:51.210" style="s2">haystack problem yeah there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.890" end="00:44:52.650" style="s2">people that would buy the product but</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.210" end="00:44:54.570" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to distinguish that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.650" end="00:44:56.700" style="s2">million from the 300 million in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.570" end="00:44:59.010" style="s2">country if you talk about that a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.700" end="00:45:01.260" style="s2">bit yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.010" end="00:45:02.790" style="s2">again it&#39;s just logic and strangely</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.260" end="00:45:06.690" style="s2">enough this you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.790" end="00:45:09.030" style="s2">fantasy in business thinking and not</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.690" end="00:45:11.310" style="s2">just among civilians or amateurs and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.030" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea if I have the great</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.310" end="00:45:15.000" style="s2">product you know the world&#39;s gonna beat</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:17.700" style="s2">a path to my door there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.000" end="00:45:19.380" style="s2">fantasy oh if I write the great ad the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.700" end="00:45:21.150" style="s2">world is gonna be to pass in my door</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.380" end="00:45:23.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s good to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.150" end="00:45:25.859" style="s2">ad but you also need to be able to put</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.640" end="00:45:29.100" style="s2">that ad in front of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.859" end="00:45:30.570" style="s2">gonna care and do it economically and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.100" end="00:45:32.250" style="s2">don&#39;t mean inexpensively I just mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.570" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">economically in the sense of dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.250" end="00:45:38.130" style="s2">dollars out so if you can&#39;t clearly</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:40.170" style="s2">figure out how you&#39;re gonna put your</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.130" end="00:45:42.390" style="s2">message or your product or your offer or</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.170" end="00:45:44.369" style="s2">whatever it is in front of the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.390" end="00:45:47.490" style="s2">people you don&#39;t have a business</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.369" end="00:45:49.619" style="s2">opportunity you have a you know an idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.490" end="00:45:52.590" style="s2">and you know ideas as they say or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.619" end="00:45:55.109" style="s2">dime-a-dozen so you know the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.590" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">hasn&#39;t necessarily solved the problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.109" end="00:45:58.200" style="s2">you still have to figure out okay where</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:00.630" style="s2">are the people I&#39;m it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.200" end="00:46:01.980" style="s2">easier but you know where are the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.630" end="00:46:04.470" style="s2">who are gonna be interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.980" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">offer it&#39;s up I&#39;m just curious like for</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.470" end="00:46:09.030" style="s2">instance my podcast I do a small amount</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:10.680" style="s2">of promotion so far just experimental to</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.030" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">understand the shape of the field I</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.680" end="00:46:14.250" style="s2">would I initially started doing just</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:15.810" style="s2">some regular small-scale Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.250" end="00:46:18.600" style="s2">advertising didn&#39;t work at all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.810" end="00:46:19.980" style="s2">yeah yeah well why is that I said you</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.600" end="00:46:22.170" style="s2">dumb idiot you should realize this</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.980" end="00:46:24.540" style="s2">before you spent your $50 which is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.170" end="00:46:25.590" style="s2">only a relatively small minority of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.540" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">people listen to buy</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.590" end="00:46:30.210" style="s2">gasps so yep yep if you say all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:32.910" style="s2">give me everybody in state of Virginia</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.210" end="00:46:34.500" style="s2">some random sample of Minh and push them</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.910" end="00:46:36.060" style="s2">to my podcast listen was that again I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.500" end="00:46:37.740" style="s2">said about podcast so even if they do</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.060" end="00:46:41.640" style="s2">accidentally click on ago I might have</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.740" end="00:46:43.050" style="s2">guessed right and you actually do have</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.640" end="00:46:45.510" style="s2">to be quite tricky to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.050" end="00:46:48.360" style="s2">zero in on people who actually do listen</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.510" end="00:46:50.100" style="s2">to podcasts and it took me several</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.360" end="00:46:51.540" style="s2">iterations and I think this year I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.100" end="00:46:53.430" style="s2">gonna push a little stronger on</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.540" end="00:46:55.410" style="s2">marketing now that I have figured out</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.430" end="00:46:57.990" style="s2">there is a way to find a concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.410" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">enough market of podcast listeners but a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.990" end="00:47:03.300" style="s2">naive approach didn&#39;t work at all it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:05.580" style="s2">off by a factor of five and they took</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.300" end="00:47:08.220" style="s2">some incremental experimentation to find</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.580" end="00:47:10.980" style="s2">out what worked you don&#39;t have a friend</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.220" end="00:47:14.790" style="s2">the sadly passed away two summers ago</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.980" end="00:47:17.370" style="s2">James Martell and he had as far as he</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.790" end="00:47:19.800" style="s2">could tell the longest continuously</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.370" end="00:47:21.240" style="s2">running podcast on the Internet not not</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.800" end="00:47:24.270" style="s2">the original one because the original</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.240" end="00:47:28.080" style="s2">one discontinued but the longest-running</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.270" end="00:47:30.540" style="s2">one and he came up with a few gems one</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.080" end="00:47:32.940" style="s2">of course is get on as many related</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.540" end="00:47:36.660" style="s2">podcasts as a guess as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.940" end="00:47:39.420" style="s2">that&#39;s just the golden method yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.660" end="00:47:40.710" style="s2">got a bit of that six or seven and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.420" end="00:47:42.060" style="s2">gonna do more this year and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.710" end="00:47:43.800" style="s2">absolutely right instead it&#39;s cheap</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.060" end="00:47:45.750" style="s2">right now we&#39;re worth your time and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.800" end="00:47:49.080" style="s2">reach you know thousands of people and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.750" end="00:47:50.790" style="s2">every person you reach is qualified on</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.080" end="00:47:53.250" style="s2">at least one level you know they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.790" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">podcast listener and and interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.250" end="00:47:57.000" style="s2">know that&#39;s that every is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:47:59.190" style="s2">subject if somebody&#39;s doing a direct</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.000" end="00:48:01.470" style="s2">mail campaign and let&#39;s say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.190" end="00:48:03.540" style="s2">selling looking around my office for</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.470" end="00:48:05.010" style="s2">something irrelevant I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.540" end="00:48:06.870" style="s2">they&#39;re selling CD I believe it or not</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.010" end="00:48:09.630" style="s2">to have a CD player in my office still</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.870" end="00:48:12.030" style="s2">there selling CD players what&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.630" end="00:48:14.340" style="s2">important thing to have if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.030" end="00:48:17.670" style="s2">you&#39;re going after a list of prospects</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.340" end="00:48:19.740" style="s2">for CD players well one of course is</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.670" end="00:48:21.060" style="s2">that they are interested in the CD</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.740" end="00:48:23.250" style="s2">players but there&#39;s another element</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.060" end="00:48:26.660" style="s2">which is absolutely essential which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.250" end="00:48:28.980" style="s2">that they are a known mail-order buyer</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.660" end="00:48:30.840" style="s2">all right so in other words it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.980" end="00:48:32.700" style="s2">just enough that somebody&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.840" end="00:48:34.770" style="s2">direct-response world it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.700" end="00:48:37.560" style="s2">enough that somebody&#39;s interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.770" end="00:48:39.190" style="s2">product category that&#39;s that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.560" end="00:48:41.650" style="s2">you need that it&#39;s sort of a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.190" end="00:48:44.770" style="s2">but you also have to blend in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.650" end="00:48:46.900" style="s2">element that this person as some time in</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.770" end="00:48:49.930" style="s2">their history hopefully a lot has made</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.900" end="00:48:52.630" style="s2">mail-order purchases before so when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.930" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">go to let&#39;s say to a list broker someone</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.630" end="00:48:55.690" style="s2">that you say hey I got this thing I want</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:56.560" style="s2">to sell it do you have lists of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.690" end="00:48:58.570" style="s2">that love music</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.560" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">okay here&#39;s people that love music now I</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.570" end="00:49:03.460" style="s2">want a responsive list I want a list of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:06.250" style="s2">people that have bought via this channel</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.810" end="00:50:30.700" style="s2">have not done that last one the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.150" end="00:50:32.410" style="s2">ones I am doing I probably should the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.700" end="00:50:34.990" style="s2">other one I hear very successful</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.410" end="00:50:37.390" style="s2">podcasters do is ask for five star</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.990" end="00:50:39.250" style="s2">ratings on their podcast apps yep</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.390" end="00:50:40.750" style="s2">haven&#39;t done that either I used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.250" end="00:50:43.090" style="s2">shameless promoter and never used to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.750" end="00:50:46.390" style="s2">never be unwilling to do such thing but</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.090" end="00:50:48.460" style="s2">so far a little shy on this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.390" end="00:50:49.900" style="s2">maybe that&#39;d be what part of my 2020</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.460" end="00:50:51.840" style="s2">marketing campaigns get a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.900" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">stronger about asking people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.840" end="00:50:55.320" style="s2">of this my thing I&#39;ve got you know all</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:56.910" style="s2">five star ratings pretty much and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.320" end="00:50:58.500" style="s2">everybody tells me they like it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.910" end="00:51:00.450" style="s2">know I don&#39;t seem to be lying and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.500" end="00:51:02.070" style="s2">numbers keep growing so maybe you should</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.450" end="00:51:03.450" style="s2">start asking people to do more to help</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.070" end="00:51:06.060" style="s2">promote it that&#39;s actually a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.450" end="00:51:09.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s one thing you know you learn</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.060" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">from direct mail as you know ask ask ask</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.630" end="00:51:13.860" style="s2">I remember this really simple experiment</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:16.530" style="s2">that was done they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.860" end="00:51:19.650" style="s2">persuade college students to get the flu</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.530" end="00:51:21.630" style="s2">shot right so one version of the ad gave</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.650" end="00:51:23.370" style="s2">all the reasons why it&#39;s a good idea or</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.630" end="00:51:25.680" style="s2">why the people providing and thought it</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.370" end="00:51:27.960" style="s2">was a good idea and the other version</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.680" end="00:51:30.870" style="s2">did the same thing but it showed a map</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.960" end="00:51:33.330" style="s2">of where the clinic was and how to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.870" end="00:51:36.360" style="s2">there right and just adding that little</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.330" end="00:51:39.390" style="s2">bit of concrete how-to information that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.360" end="00:51:41.400" style="s2">that explicit direction you know boosted</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.390" end="00:51:43.500" style="s2">the response you know and enormous ly so</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.400" end="00:51:45.540" style="s2">little things can make a huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.500" end="00:51:47.250" style="s2">like sue saying hey you know give us a</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.540" end="00:51:49.290" style="s2">you know feel e if you enjoyed it give</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.250" end="00:51:51.030" style="s2">us a five star rating or give us the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.290" end="00:51:52.110" style="s2">rating you think we&#39;re worth tell your</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.030" end="00:51:54.600" style="s2">friends you might have a friend that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.110" end="00:51:56.790" style="s2">likes this kind of stuff you know you</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.600" end="00:51:59.970" style="s2">know my jazz site you know it fluctuates</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.790" end="00:52:02.150" style="s2">a lot I&#39;m gonna have enough it&#39;s it goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.970" end="00:52:04.740" style="s2">bangs between thirty and forty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.150" end="00:52:07.080" style="s2">subscribers email subscribers I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.740" end="00:52:09.180" style="s2">have never advertised it now I had the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.080" end="00:52:10.560" style="s2">advantage of starting when video on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.180" end="00:52:12.300" style="s2">internet was brand new and that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.560" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">main thing is we have thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.300" end="00:52:16.290" style="s2">thousands of classic jazz videos so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:19.890" style="s2">got a bit of a run up that way by being</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.290" end="00:52:23.160" style="s2">early but still I we grow by the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.890" end="00:52:26.310" style="s2">being passed hand to hand and makes</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.160" end="00:52:27.660" style="s2">sense in a networked world like the jazz</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.310" end="00:52:29.940" style="s2">world you know people have their jazz</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.660" end="00:52:33.480" style="s2">buddies they go out and hear things you</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.940" end="00:52:35.190" style="s2">know music together they hang out on</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.480" end="00:52:37.020" style="s2">various online sites so there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.190" end="00:52:39.060" style="s2">bit of natural sharing so I&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.020" end="00:52:41.820" style="s2">that entire business with no advertising</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.060" end="00:52:43.380" style="s2">that&#39;s amazing and being there first of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.820" end="00:52:45.090" style="s2">course helps but then you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.380" end="00:52:47.040" style="s2">have good execution which you must have</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.090" end="00:52:48.870" style="s2">right if you&#39;re still here lowly&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:50.640" style="s2">of the years later and you know at least</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.870" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">tied for number one with some of the big</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.640" end="00:52:55.410" style="s2">names in the biz</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:59.130" style="s2">and unlike them I am focused on getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.410" end="00:53:01.499" style="s2">my users to share the information so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.130" end="00:53:03.779" style="s2">asked we say that in every email you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.499" end="00:53:05.219" style="s2">know and they don&#39;t do that they just</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.779" end="00:53:06.779" style="s2">think they&#39;re very corporate you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.219" end="00:53:08.670" style="s2">they&#39;re very buttoned up and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.779" end="00:53:10.619" style="s2">everything&#39;s very proper and you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.670" end="00:53:13.289" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to a degree to shamelessly</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.619" end="00:53:15.479" style="s2">beg and I think that&#39;s made all the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.289" end="00:53:18.209" style="s2">difference for me also I mail every day</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.479" end="00:53:19.559" style="s2">now that takes a lot of work and some</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.209" end="00:53:21.479" style="s2">people might say well gee that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.559" end="00:53:23.940" style="s2">excessive people are gonna be disgusted</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.479" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">you know getting email every day and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.940" end="00:53:29.369" style="s2">answer to that for me is if they&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:30.719" style="s2">the subject they&#39;re gonna love it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.369" end="00:53:33.209" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna wish that I mailed 10</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.719" end="00:53:34.619" style="s2">times a day and if they&#39;re not into it</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.209" end="00:53:37.199" style="s2">well yeah they might be annoyed but</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.619" end="00:53:40.049" style="s2">that&#39;s not my customer anyway just so my</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.199" end="00:53:42.749" style="s2">date my daily email I think does a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.049" end="00:53:45.150" style="s2">to keep keep me very competitive with</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:23.810" style="s2">content to keep people on the site so</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:25.490" style="s2">they recruited lots and lots of content</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.810" end="01:00:27.950" style="s2">experts that said look as long as</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.770" end="01:01:06.020" style="s2">been 1982 I think and I identified some</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.760" end="01:01:08.540" style="s2">people that had their own kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.020" end="01:01:11.000" style="s2">prototype blogs that ran on our software</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.540" end="01:01:13.100" style="s2">and I went out to six out who I thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.000" end="01:01:15.230" style="s2">were the most interesting and I cut a</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.100" end="01:01:18.080" style="s2">deal to pay them seventeen and a half</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.230" end="01:01:21.050" style="s2">percent of the revenue they generate it</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.080" end="01:01:22.760" style="s2">as a royalty and so that was actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.050" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">the beginning of that old business model</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.760" end="01:01:28.460" style="s2">and before I launched it I got a moral</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">commitment from the president and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.460" end="01:01:33.770" style="s2">CEO that they would never do what AOL</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:35.870" style="s2">later did which was to try to cut out</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.770" end="01:01:38.930" style="s2">these guys by doing it in-house Oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.870" end="01:01:40.580" style="s2">granny I could see that hazard even then</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.930" end="01:01:43.069" style="s2">even when the stakes where these guys</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.580" end="01:01:45.529" style="s2">were lucky to get checks for 500 bucks</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.069" end="01:01:47.959" style="s2">a month but I tell ya 500 bucks real</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.529" end="01:01:51.140" style="s2">money in 1980 to be the equivalent about</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.959" end="01:01:52.609" style="s2">$1,500 a month now was life-changing for</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.140" end="01:01:54.199" style="s2">these people they and they they have</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.609" end="01:01:56.329" style="s2">they long thought that was it was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.199" end="01:01:59.029" style="s2">great deal for that ya to do something</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.329" end="01:02:00.979" style="s2">you love and to you know how you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.029" end="01:02:02.180" style="s2">how much better can it be and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.979" end="01:02:03.259" style="s2">done as I don&#39;t understand certain</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.180" end="01:02:05.630" style="s2">things like some of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.259" end="01:02:07.729" style="s2">Google does for example they make all</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.630" end="01:02:10.539" style="s2">their money from pretty much straight</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.729" end="01:02:14.119" style="s2">advertising like without any super</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.539" end="01:02:16.569" style="s2">surveillance you know and yet they get</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.119" end="01:02:19.789" style="s2">involved in all these extracurricular</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.569" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">surveillance activities and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.789" end="01:02:23.959" style="s2">I just well they&#39;re do surveillance I</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:26.150" style="s2">mean why do you think they give you</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.959" end="01:02:29.150" style="s2">Gmail for free so they can read your</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.150" end="01:02:30.859" style="s2">Gmail that&#39;s why they get free which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.150" end="01:02:31.519" style="s2">why I never used Gmail I thought this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.859" end="01:02:33.019" style="s2">appalling</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.519" end="01:02:34.489" style="s2">one and I don&#39;t want to miss I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.019" end="01:02:36.949" style="s2">want anyone even a machine to read my</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.489" end="01:02:38.630" style="s2">email but their their logic was well if</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.949" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about you know fireworks</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.630" end="01:02:42.049" style="s2">will show him a fireworks ad there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:43.759" style="s2">logic to that when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.049" end="01:02:45.559" style="s2">searching or when you&#39;re on somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.759" end="01:02:47.779" style="s2">website and they&#39;ve made room for Google</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.559" end="01:02:49.670" style="s2">ads if it&#39;s a again if it&#39;s a fireworks</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.779" end="01:02:51.319" style="s2">website why not run a fireworks ad that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.670" end="01:02:53.959" style="s2">makes sense but some of the other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.319" end="01:02:56.420" style="s2">they do yeah I guess you know problem is</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.959" end="01:02:59.420" style="s2">a public company has to keep growing it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.420" end="01:03:01.670" style="s2">has to keep grabbing more and more and</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.420" end="01:03:03.380" style="s2">more and more and I think that you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.670" end="01:03:05.299" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.380" end="01:03:06.949" style="s2">that&#39;s going wrong in my opinion like</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.299" end="01:03:08.930" style="s2">take you something like YouTube which I</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.949" end="01:03:11.900" style="s2">think is the wonder of the age I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.930" end="01:03:13.759" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the most amazing miraculous</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.900" end="01:03:17.539" style="s2">things that human beings have ever</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.759" end="01:03:19.339" style="s2">created but now you know you google</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.539" end="01:03:21.559" style="s2">YouTube&#39;s made a deal with the network&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.339" end="01:03:23.989" style="s2">and there&#39;s less sort of putting the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.559" end="01:03:26.900" style="s2">screws to a lot of these amateur content</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.989" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">makers to make more room for the network</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.900" end="01:03:32.479" style="s2">content and it&#39;s like really you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.319" end="01:03:35.449" style="s2">you see that also in healthcare they did</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.479" end="01:03:37.579" style="s2">a got a 700 million dollar plus deal</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.449" end="01:03:40.009" style="s2">with said Glaxo or one of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.579" end="01:03:42.680" style="s2">companies and you know it&#39;s like you</p>

<p begin="01:03:45.109" end="01:03:47.660" style="s2">well they have to go there because</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.039" end="01:03:49.579" style="s2">they&#39;re public and they got to keep</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.660" end="01:03:51.709" style="s2">coming up with newer and newer and newer</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.579" end="01:03:54.170" style="s2">ways to make more and more money but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.709" end="01:03:55.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know we&#39;ll see a lot more of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.170" end="01:03:57.370" style="s2">too because they</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.370" end="01:04:02.170" style="s2">running the place right but now those</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.980" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">two guys are retired I&#39;m gonna assume</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.170" end="01:04:06.490" style="s2">unless I see wrong evidence the other</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:08.970" style="s2">side that the suits will have taken over</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.490" end="01:04:11.560" style="s2">and Google will be set on an economic</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.970" end="01:04:13.300" style="s2">maximization setting on its business</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.560" end="01:04:15.640" style="s2">model I don&#39;t think it ever was before</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.300" end="01:04:18.190" style="s2">but I believe it will be going forward</p>

<p begin="01:04:18.190" end="01:04:23.500" style="s2">mind is Facebook yeah you know Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.650" end="01:04:25.480" style="s2">was so profitable from so early there</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.500" end="01:04:27.730" style="s2">was absolutely no reason they had to</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.480" end="01:04:30.310" style="s2">take that puppy public right they could</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.730" end="01:04:31.600" style="s2">have run a small secondary market in</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.470" end="01:04:47.320" style="s2">world in a good way by bringing us all</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.110" end="01:04:49.570" style="s2">together but instead he got in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.320" end="01:04:52.600" style="s2">business of hijacking our attention to</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.570" end="01:04:55.480" style="s2">sell us to advertisers because he had to</p>

<p begin="01:05:08.710" end="01:05:13.330" style="s2">became a show yeah and these these</p>

<p begin="01:05:48.310" end="01:05:52.870" style="s2">pattern because of their super powerful</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.680" end="01:05:55.450" style="s2">network effects and at Google and</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.870" end="01:05:57.900" style="s2">Facebook now on about 70% of all</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.900" end="01:06:02.080" style="s2">because they&#39;re so dominant their ads</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:04.120" style="s2">are actually not very obnoxious you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.080" end="01:06:06.490" style="s2">they don&#39;t pop out at you and flash and</p>

<p begin="01:06:08.560" end="01:06:12.970" style="s2">effects have allowed them not to be</p>

<p begin="01:20:43.829" end="01:20:48.389" style="s2">remarkably profitable because hello</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.809" end="01:20:51.829" style="s2">domain name in those days 70 bucks for</p>

<p begin="01:20:56.610" end="01:21:01.170" style="s2">actually sold at the top we pulled the</p>

<p begin="01:21:01.170" end="01:21:05.309" style="s2">close to the top as the internet bubble</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.880" end="01:21:07.409" style="s2">as you could possibly find and so we got</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.309" end="01:21:08.789" style="s2">the best possible price for it but the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.409" end="01:21:11.010" style="s2">operating environment probably got</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.789" end="01:21:13.199" style="s2">better in the years ahead as you said</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.010" end="01:21:15.510" style="s2">the direct response clicks became almost</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.199" end="01:21:17.760" style="s2">worth noting there for a couple of years</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.510" end="01:21:19.559" style="s2">in the years afterwards yeah I have to</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.760" end="01:21:21.809" style="s2">admit you know and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.559" end="01:21:24.719" style="s2">challenges of being early you know you</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.809" end="01:21:27.659" style="s2">started in the 80s early 80s I started</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.719" end="01:21:30.030" style="s2">in there in earliest 90s and so by the</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.659" end="01:21:32.670" style="s2">time 2000 came along you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.030" end="01:21:34.280" style="s2">sort of a psychological landmark of 2002</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.670" end="01:21:36.329" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay this is the end of time</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.280" end="01:21:38.789" style="s2">in other so weird it&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.329" end="01:21:40.449" style="s2">phenomenon but clearly that the markets</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.789" end="01:21:42.160" style="s2">grown quite a bit since</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.449" end="01:21:44.530" style="s2">and yeah there are things that I wish</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.160" end="01:21:46.900" style="s2">that I&#39;d stayed with that I was doing in</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.530" end="01:21:49.210" style="s2">2000 but I went in other directions and</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.900" end="01:21:51.160" style="s2">did other other fun stuff but yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.210" end="01:21:53.170" style="s2">mean they the growth since 2000 has been</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.160" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">spectacular but there was that death</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.170" end="01:21:58.420" style="s2">valley period where I mean I went back</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:22:00.850" style="s2">to San Francisco even as late as 2003</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.420" end="01:22:01.830" style="s2">and it was like a neutron bomb and hit</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.850" end="01:22:04.210" style="s2">the bay area</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.830" end="01:22:06.070" style="s2">she could actually buy residential real</p>

<p begin="01:22:09.880" end="01:22:14.320" style="s2">banner ad story because alright so and</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.940" end="01:22:17.530" style="s2">this I think was this might have been my</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.320" end="01:22:21.190" style="s2">biggest contribution of all so it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.530" end="01:22:22.239" style="s2">June of 1994 which was just a couple I</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.190" end="01:22:24.070" style="s2">think a month earlier had been the</p>
