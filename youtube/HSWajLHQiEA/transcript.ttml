<p begin="00:00:05.120" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">right I already did one that was very</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">rested I just pleaded it since no one</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">popped it doesn&#39;t really matter and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">I went on Facebook because why wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">I customer I live and someone posted</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">this and you know there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:25.380" style="s2">here I&#39;m part of a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">attachment parenting groups and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">therefore a lot of my friends are also</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:31.260" style="s2">part of attachment parenting stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">it&#39;s the philosophy I tried to follow</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.260" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">with my baby when she was a baby now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">probably more of the leg</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:44.610" style="s2">but not neglect parents cuz it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">I&#39;m capable of and here&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.610" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">was posted it&#39;s a picture so in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">family we are trauma-informed we connect</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:52.969" style="s2">before we correct</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">we understand behavior is communication</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.969" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">we teach self-regulation we allow</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">do-overs we think camp instead of won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:06.030" style="s2">we empathize when someone when someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">flipping their lid we make repair we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.030" end="00:01:09.990" style="s2">breathe deeply we love even more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">and we know healing happens in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">relationships that&#39;s by attachment in</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">trauma Network and that&#39;s very much the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:23.790" style="s2">parenting style I try to implement I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">fail horribly at it constantly and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">think that&#39;s a piece of it that we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:32.310" style="s2">to do this for ourselves as well as our</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">children we need to understand that our</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.310" end="00:01:38.729" style="s2">behavior is also communication like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">have anxiety and I flip out all the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.729" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">and I&#39;m like okay like the more I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">realize that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing it instead</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:47.490" style="s2">of making myself wrong about it just</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">correct it repair it like move forth</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.490" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">like it&#39;s like yeah I do yell a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;m not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">like it&#39;s anger and it&#39;s getting out in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">a way that&#39;s not violence in a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not um hopefully scary to my kids</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">like she&#39;s scared of me</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">and anyway like it&#39;s like it works like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">it&#39;s not this that&#39;s not but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:12.030" style="s2">allowing myself to be this and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:14.310" style="s2">that&#39;s to me we need to do this in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.030" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">world not just for children</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.310" end="00:02:18.930" style="s2">great we raised an entire generation</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:20.430" style="s2">like this every child that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.930" end="00:02:21.959" style="s2">would be amazing but the truth is every</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.430" end="00:02:24.510" style="s2">adult can&#39;t raise their child this way</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.959" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">because we are not like I&#39;m in the I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.510" end="00:02:29.370" style="s2">not quite capable of this and I love I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.330" end="00:02:31.560" style="s2">love the concept of calling people in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.370" end="00:02:32.970" style="s2">and you have no idea how to do it like</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.560" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">I&#39;m like all I know how to do is call</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.970" end="00:02:36.690" style="s2">people oh dear I&#39;d like my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:38.459" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s you know smokings bad for</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">you it&#39;s like who didn&#39;t know smoking</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.459" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">was bad for them if they&#39;re smoking a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">cigarette they know you know like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:47.850" style="s2">is not Vera when I was a vegetarian I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:49.890" style="s2">not a vegetarian really and calling</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.850" end="00:02:51.390" style="s2">people out and it never changes people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.890" end="00:02:54.299" style="s2">minds it might make me feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.390" end="00:02:56.130" style="s2">better but I know with that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.299" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">change people&#39;s minds I don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.130" end="00:03:00.810" style="s2">ever has and I think that what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">powerful is calling people in but there</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.810" end="00:03:05.069" style="s2">isn&#39;t really a lot of why do something</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">how to actually do that it&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.069" end="00:03:10.769" style="s2">like a feeling right and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:12.299" style="s2">coming back to love is and this I this</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.769" end="00:03:14.580" style="s2">concept like I think this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.299" end="00:03:15.959" style="s2">calling people it&#39;s your children but</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.580" end="00:03:17.010" style="s2">like calling them and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.959" end="00:03:19.049" style="s2">outright the whole point is we</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.010" end="00:03:20.910" style="s2">understand that behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.049" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">communication that when someone is doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.910" end="00:03:24.329" style="s2">something and they have this concept I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know which tribe in Africa or</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.329" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">whether that&#39;s just a myth anyway I like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">the tribe that the communities like when</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:35.900" style="s2">they do something wrong instead of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:43.799" style="s2">punishing them they surround them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.900" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">show them how loved they are like if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.799" end="00:03:48.209" style="s2">had a criminal justice system that take</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:51.989" style="s2">that but you need a criminal justice</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.209" end="00:03:54.690" style="s2">system like it&#39;s the earning but both it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.989" end="00:03:58.440" style="s2">like we based if we raised an entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.690" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">generation like this we wouldn&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.440" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s automatic so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">attachment parenting is it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:07.109" style="s2">the more you we raise peaceful kids the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:08.730" style="s2">bohr they don&#39;t need to do a world in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.109" end="00:04:10.590" style="s2">which is correcting where maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.730" end="00:04:13.470" style="s2">weren&#39;t so peacefully raised and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.590" end="00:04:15.329" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect too because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.470" end="00:04:17.729" style="s2">experienced one of experience it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.329" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">me who I am in order to have more</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.729" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">compassion for my kid and pass on less</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">trauma probably not zero but less when</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">my parents did the same they passed on</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:27.430" style="s2">less trauma to me than they had right</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.430" end="00:04:34.300" style="s2">it&#39;s improving and but improving in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">incremental way that&#39;s not like an</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.300" end="00:04:37.479" style="s2">all-or-nothing because we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:39.880" style="s2">everything we can&#39;t be perfect I&#39;m a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.479" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">being perfect is perfect how horrible</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.880" end="00:04:42.940" style="s2">would it be if you had a perfect parent</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:44.470" style="s2">like a perfect it never did anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.940" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">wrong how would you know how to correct</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.470" end="00:04:50.650" style="s2">yourself when you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">honestly ridiculous thank goodness I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.650" end="00:04:54.669" style="s2">not a perfect fairy but so like raised</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:56.410" style="s2">our kids that way is what this is all</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.669" end="00:04:59.080" style="s2">about but also happy not for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.410" end="00:05:00.820" style="s2">that like there&#39;s things that I truly</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.080" end="00:05:02.410" style="s2">can&#39;t do it&#39;s not that I won&#39;t do them</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.820" end="00:05:04.090" style="s2">it&#39;s that I can like I&#39;m like my brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.410" end="00:05:08.680" style="s2">will not retain information like it used</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.090" end="00:05:10.150" style="s2">to read Tina I like stupid makes my</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.680" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">world fall apart and you know I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.150" end="00:05:13.030" style="s2">handle the big stuff like I am handling</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.919" end="00:05:14.410" style="s2">the big stuff which is partly why I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.030" end="00:05:17.229" style="s2">can&#39;t have the little stuff it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.410" end="00:05:19.210" style="s2">okay like braiding tumors in poverty</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.229" end="00:05:22.509" style="s2">like personally and then like globally</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.210" end="00:05:25.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like poverty and climate change all</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.509" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">of these big huge things that because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.180" end="00:05:30.550" style="s2">have a solution or like Wayne heavy on</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:31.960" style="s2">my shoulders and and I&#39;m just like going</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.550" end="00:05:33.580" style="s2">with the flow and not having it weigh</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.960" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">heavily on my shoulders I&#39;m like okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.580" end="00:05:37.330" style="s2">this is gonna unfold in its right time</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:38.440" style="s2">you just have to be doing what you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.330" end="00:05:41.080" style="s2">do it I know I&#39;m not a hundred percent</p>
