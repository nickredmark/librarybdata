<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:27.750" style="s2">difficult thing for me to sort out for</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:29.580" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.750" end="00:00:30.750" style="s2">right so cat food I rely on the external</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.210" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">no I mean she&#39;s not a death store you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.530" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">know what I mean if she was actually at</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">figure out a way but so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">that&#39;s about it other than that give</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">anyway so quarantine II makes very very</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:01:02.550" style="s2">little difference to me but yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:04.140" style="s2">I&#39;m I guess for me this is an awful</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.550" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">thing to say in a way but I guess for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.140" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">I am above all excitedly curious about</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">the whole thing to see how it all plays</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">out I&#39;m very interested in the sort of 6</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">to 18 months from now kind of period and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:21.990" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna what&#39;s going to unfold</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">because there&#39;s going to be consequences</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">of consequences of consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">consequences but that&#39;s not really what</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">this is about so I&#39;ll shut up there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">for all of it how are you coping this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">a rather broad broad category do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">wanna go care sure so for me in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">ways my life isn&#39;t very different</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">because I you know I I do a lot of I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">don&#39;t didn&#39;t go out a lot before but</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">there are a few things that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">different like my husband is home all</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:02:00.920" style="s2">the time now which it you know for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">last five or six years we have lived</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.920" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">except like he he goes he goes somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">during the week for work and he&#39;s home</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">on the weekends and so now we&#39;ve bent</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">now had this is the most amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:16.860" style="s2">we&#39;ve spent together and several years</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:18.799" style="s2">so we get a long okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.860" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">but there are some other ramifications</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.799" end="00:02:23.099" style="s2">about about there&#39;s some stuff about him</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">being around all the time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.099" end="00:02:28.769" style="s2">bringing a lot of difficult emotions for</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:32.489" style="s2">me to the surface and so getting to work</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.769" end="00:02:34.739" style="s2">through that and the way we do it is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.489" end="00:02:36.359" style="s2">do lap we once we have worked through</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.739" end="00:02:37.739" style="s2">something we do something called laptop</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.359" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">couples therapy and we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.739" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">that on Facebook live where we just get</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:43.829" style="s2">a you know we talked about how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:45.239" style="s2">process things because we know that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.829" end="00:02:51.090" style="s2">know not everybody talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.239" end="00:02:55.079" style="s2">stuff but also my mom is in my mom&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">in Seattle she has underlying health</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.079" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">conditions that make her really</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:01.379" style="s2">susceptible and so there&#39;s that been</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">that confirmed and she&#39;s been in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.379" end="00:03:07.379" style="s2">really weird position where she actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:12.659" style="s2">works for like the biggest hospital in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.379" end="00:03:15.359" style="s2">downtown Seattle and um and she works in</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.659" end="00:03:19.829" style="s2">a like close you know close part of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.359" end="00:03:22.079" style="s2">hospital and she was set to retire May</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.829" end="00:03:24.060" style="s2">1st and so there was this cascade of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.079" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">things that all of a sudden she thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:28.139" style="s2">she had two months to get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:29.790" style="s2">things sorted out and then we had to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.139" end="00:03:31.829" style="s2">a she had to do a bunch of things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.790" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">had her out in the public because she</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.829" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">had to go to Social Security office and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:37.019" style="s2">all these things and we&#39;re like me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:38.849" style="s2">my husband are like what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.019" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">leaving the house and she&#39;s like well I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.849" end="00:03:43.650" style="s2">have to make sure these things are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.440" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">place before I retire and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.650" end="00:03:49.019" style="s2">there&#39;s been the concern about that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:52.769" style="s2">then getting to watch myself wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.019" end="00:03:54.750" style="s2">do hoarding I I would like to say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.769" end="00:03:56.549" style="s2">that that I&#39;m not but you know my</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.750" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">scarcity mindset coming to the surface</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.549" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">and you know that getting to watch my</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:13.739" style="s2">mind go into the places of a lot of fear</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:17.909" style="s2">and yeah and one of the ways that I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.739" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">coping with kovat 19 is with food I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.909" end="00:04:24.659" style="s2">live not gonna yeah and eating more more</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:26.420" style="s2">sugar than usual just probably not good</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.659" end="00:04:28.100" style="s2">for my immune system but</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.420" end="00:04:30.710" style="s2">it&#39;s been one of the ways that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.100" end="00:04:33.730" style="s2">coping and but overall doing pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.710" end="00:04:35.900" style="s2">but I kind of lost it over the weekend</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.730" end="00:04:37.550" style="s2">something about way too many dishes I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.900" end="00:04:39.410" style="s2">wasn&#39;t used to that having that because</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.550" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">my husband&#39;s not usually home during the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.410" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">week there was it seemed to be an</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:45.770" style="s2">exorbitant amount of dishes that I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:48.640" style="s2">doing and it&#39;s the little things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.770" end="00:04:52.900" style="s2">are you know bring up the stress and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.640" end="00:04:57.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of just little things and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.900" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s there&#39;s just a lot so</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.400" end="00:05:14.660" style="s2">the one life you did a bit of it which</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.470" end="00:05:28.820" style="s2">in an hour and it&#39;s my one instead of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.170" end="00:05:30.500" style="s2">being the biggest chore that I hate a</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.290" end="00:05:39.830" style="s2">started people were first starting to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.910" end="00:05:41.480" style="s2">at home I was flying to about political</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.830" end="00:05:42.650" style="s2">visit my family and it&#39;s my extended</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.330" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">here still I stocked up on stuff but he</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.090" end="00:06:05.210" style="s2">still has to go to medical appointments</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">so he goes there and it takes the bus</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.210" end="00:06:09.530" style="s2">back and he&#39;s very independent and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">like you can&#39;t take the bus like you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.530" end="00:06:13.820" style="s2">and so I I have to like find a way to</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.140" end="00:06:28.460" style="s2">it&#39;s frustrating but I find like well I</p>

<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">happening because we can&#39;t do this is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.890" end="00:10:53.480" style="s2">situation where fight-or-flight doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:56.360" style="s2">work and what you know what&#39;s the option</p>

<p begin="00:11:18.699" end="00:11:22.589" style="s2">does that is shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.660" end="00:11:26.019" style="s2">so I can because I have that same thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.589" end="00:11:29.139" style="s2">like I know that I&#39;m capable of more and</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.759" end="00:12:53.169" style="s2">saying that it occurred to me that if</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.499" end="00:12:54.999" style="s2">you decide to do like a solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.169" end="00:12:58.269" style="s2">on that piece of it I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.999" end="00:13:03.759" style="s2">participate in that because yeah on</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.269" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">mental health emotional health that that</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.610" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.510" end="00:13:26.089" style="s2">are gonna not be able to afford their</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:27.769" style="s2">medication we&#39;re gonna have a we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.769" end="00:13:31.970" style="s2">change that may get interrupted and not</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.470" end="00:13:34.579" style="s2">be able to get people their medication</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.970" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">what do you do when people are choosing</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.579" end="00:13:37.670" style="s2">well I&#39;m just not going to take my</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:38.839" style="s2">antidepressants because I can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.670" end="00:13:42.170" style="s2">if I have to choose between that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.839" end="00:13:44.350" style="s2">food I&#39;m gonna choose food yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:48.230" style="s2">people come on in like</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.350" end="00:13:49.670" style="s2">sorry go Eric I I was just saying I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.230" end="00:13:51.529" style="s2">think here is on to something with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.670" end="00:13:53.510" style="s2">freezing thing you know as you quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.529" end="00:13:55.699" style="s2">rightly say fight-or-flight is not an</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.510" end="00:13:57.470" style="s2">option here and so you know the only</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.699" end="00:13:59.329" style="s2">response to the traumatic event Mr</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.470" end="00:14:00.829" style="s2">Freeze however what I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.329" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">freezing that the freeze response</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.829" end="00:14:07.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t last terribly long right and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:08.510" style="s2">people will emerge from that and so well</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.130" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.510" end="00:14:12.860" style="s2">to see where their energies end up</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:17.870" style="s2">becoming directed after that period of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.860" end="00:14:22.459" style="s2">being of being frozen and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.870" end="00:14:24.050" style="s2">could possibly be one of the generator</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.459" end="00:14:26.930" style="s2">functions if you like that will decide</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.050" end="00:14:28.790" style="s2">the direction that you know we go from</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.930" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">here kind of thing is how people respond</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.790" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">to all of that time to themselves will</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:37.399" style="s2">they use it as an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:40.430" style="s2">self-reflection and broader reflection</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.399" end="00:14:42.920" style="s2">and and the building of relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.430" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">with those in close proximity because</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.920" end="00:14:48.470" style="s2">they&#39;re forced into close proximity with</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:51.260" style="s2">them right or will it be isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.470" end="00:14:52.819" style="s2">blaming and telling on your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.260" end="00:14:54.620" style="s2">because they walk the dog for 12 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.819" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">instead of 10 minutes and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.620" end="00:15:00.410" style="s2">this this kind of thing suspicion and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:02.449" style="s2">accusation I I think it&#39;s really I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.410" end="00:15:04.459" style="s2">I don&#39;t have a prediction I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.449" end="00:15:06.380" style="s2">but I and obviously it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.459" end="00:15:07.750" style="s2">some mixture of these two things where</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.380" end="00:15:12.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be all one or other</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.750" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">but but you know whatever the trend is I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.860" end="00:15:19.339" style="s2">think is is gonna be a really defining a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:21.560" style="s2">really defining thing yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.339" end="00:15:23.750" style="s2">it is even now we&#39;re seeing both right</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.560" end="00:15:25.310" style="s2">and in the same human being like I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.750" end="00:15:27.589" style="s2">care said about hoarding right like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.310" end="00:15:29.449" style="s2">like I also have like I know what humans</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.589" end="00:15:30.680" style="s2">are like and I know I honestly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.449" end="00:15:32.120" style="s2">want to live through</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.680" end="00:15:33.500" style="s2">not you don&#39;t want to feed ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.120" end="00:15:35.149" style="s2">having to steal from your neighbors and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.500" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">having to defend your food I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.149" end="00:15:38.899" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna do if it ever</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:41.570" style="s2">gets to that point but so I&#39;m also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.899" end="00:15:43.940" style="s2">not like massively stockpiling but you</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.570" end="00:15:46.040" style="s2">know a couple extra packages of pasta</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.940" end="00:15:47.450" style="s2">like quite frankly I only go shopping</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.040" end="00:15:50.570" style="s2">every two to three weeks because of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.450" end="00:15:51.950" style="s2">anxiety so now needing to do that when</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.570" end="00:15:54.350" style="s2">there&#39;s limits on stuff you can buy</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.950" end="00:15:55.790" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the normal it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.350" end="00:15:58.790" style="s2">normal that most people go everyw they</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.790" end="00:16:00.230" style="s2">go every like twice a week and that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.790" end="00:16:01.520" style="s2">I saw the mean that you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.230" end="00:16:03.560" style="s2">about you&#39;re the one about the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.520" end="00:16:05.390" style="s2">response and when I saw it there was</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.560" end="00:16:07.670" style="s2">part of it it&#39;s like that&#39;s my life like</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.390" end="00:16:09.890" style="s2">that is I can&#39;t do fight or flight so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.670" end="00:16:11.899" style="s2">do freeze and that is my nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.890" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">it shuts down under stress which means</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.899" end="00:16:16.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve developed this height all uhrin</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:18.830" style="s2">spur stress that other people can&#39;t deal</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.670" end="00:16:20.300" style="s2">with but it also doesn&#39;t go away like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.830" end="00:16:23.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that&#39;s temporary</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.300" end="00:16:25.130" style="s2">because the world is still stressful and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.330" end="00:16:26.660" style="s2">I can deal with my personal stress like</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.130" end="00:16:28.970" style="s2">what people think about me don&#39;t give a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.660" end="00:16:31.250" style="s2"> anymore because that&#39;s stress I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.970" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">let go of but I can&#39;t really let go of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.250" end="00:16:35.660" style="s2">the stress of like what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:38.029" style="s2">India and what&#39;s happening around the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.660" end="00:16:40.040" style="s2">world like I can just not look at it but</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.029" end="00:16:44.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same it&#39;s like and part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.040" end="00:16:46.339" style="s2">me I know before this before like I cram</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.600" end="00:16:48.680" style="s2">in all the that&#39;s wrong in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.339" end="00:16:50.690" style="s2">planet and wrong with humanity because</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.680" end="00:16:51.890" style="s2">it&#39;s something that I did as like I need</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.690" end="00:16:54.230" style="s2">to learn more and I&#39;m doing that with</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.890" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">coping where it&#39;s like I have the stats</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.230" end="00:16:58.220" style="s2">up and I look at them and refresh them</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:17:00.529" style="s2">every you know like five or six times a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.220" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">day probably more than that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.529" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">like what is that gonna do it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:07.069" style="s2">gonna do anything I&#39;m not gonna solve</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:08.420" style="s2">Kovan 19 but I have figured out kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.069" end="00:17:10.550" style="s2">how to solve the economy and how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.420" end="00:17:13.189" style="s2">solve human nature and how did you in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.550" end="00:17:14.780" style="s2">way and so yes I can&#39;t solve this thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.189" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">but it did work for all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.780" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s like how to let go of something</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:21.230" style="s2">that served me because it&#39;s not serving</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">me right now knowing what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.230" end="00:17:24.770" style="s2">everywhere in the world and the famines</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:27.350" style="s2">and the mists and then that isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.770" end="00:17:30.290" style="s2">to because it puts me into freeze</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.350" end="00:17:32.059" style="s2">instead of into actually taking action</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.290" end="00:17:34.940" style="s2">how do I do the solution raising how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.059" end="00:17:36.920" style="s2">I get people to come and be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.940" end="00:17:39.260" style="s2">revolution they can have from their</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.279" end="00:18:39.809" style="s2">came up for me as you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.570" end="00:18:42.090" style="s2">that I&#39;m I&#39;m participating in a group</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.809" end="00:18:44.549" style="s2">that&#39;s watching the John for baekje</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.090" end="00:18:49.380" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis series</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.549" end="00:18:54.659" style="s2">and one of the things that we we were</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.380" end="00:18:57.269" style="s2">talking about last night was one one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.659" end="00:18:59.279" style="s2">the people asked early on in the series</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.269" end="00:19:01.529" style="s2">he&#39;s like well so what sort of practical</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.279" end="00:19:03.620" style="s2">things is that you know when is he gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.529" end="00:19:06.330" style="s2">get into the sort of practical advice of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.620" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">or the pragmatic things that I can use</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.330" end="00:19:13.230" style="s2">and what we slowly come to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:14.970" style="s2">realization of is that it&#39;s he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.230" end="00:19:17.970" style="s2">giving practical advice but what he is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.970" end="00:19:22.590" style="s2">giving is he&#39;s giving a language and a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.970" end="00:19:24.840" style="s2">realization of like okay this and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.590" end="00:19:26.760" style="s2">is no longer about collecting</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.840" end="00:19:29.610" style="s2">information and collecting knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.760" end="00:19:34.279" style="s2">it&#39;s about developing wisdom and how do</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.610" end="00:19:38.159" style="s2">you do that and that&#39;s through you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.279" end="00:19:39.779" style="s2">collectively we&#39;re going at somebody hit</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.159" end="00:19:41.090" style="s2">the nail on the head collectively we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.779" end="00:19:44.490" style="s2">in an altered state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.090" end="00:19:47.630" style="s2">because life as we know it is not normal</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.490" end="00:19:51.690" style="s2">right now and so collectively we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.630" end="00:19:53.549" style="s2">altered and there is insight and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.690" end="00:19:56.490" style="s2">that&#39;s going to come from this that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.549" end="00:19:58.050" style="s2">not going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.490" end="00:20:00.390" style="s2">that no it&#39;s like there might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.050" end="00:20:03.740" style="s2">individuals who have a really good sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.390" end="00:20:07.740" style="s2">of how to fix things like you Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.740" end="00:20:09.030" style="s2">but collect them but that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.740" end="00:20:15.540" style="s2">do us a whole hell of a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.030" end="00:20:18.900" style="s2">until collectively there is a a critical</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.540" end="00:20:23.190" style="s2">mass that understands it in their body</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.900" end="00:20:25.950" style="s2">in a way that you know you know a few</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.190" end="00:20:27.900" style="s2">people do and so you know it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.950" end="00:20:31.320" style="s2">through these I I agree through these</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.900" end="00:20:34.020" style="s2">conversations that we are like figuring</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.320" end="00:20:38.250" style="s2">out okay what what is it that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.020" end="00:20:40.380" style="s2">be doing and right now like my husband</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.250" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">gets to do you know he&#39;s working on</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.380" end="00:20:46.200" style="s2">building things me I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:48.750" style="s2">building relationships and communication</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.200" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">and because that&#39;s the part that I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.750" end="00:20:53.850" style="s2">do and and getting to deal and and going</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.200" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">back to Eric what you said about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.850" end="00:20:59.390" style="s2">freeze thing but there&#39;s the freeze</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:01.620" style="s2">thing is temporary but part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.390" end="00:21:04.590" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing that it gets</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.620" end="00:21:07.380" style="s2">exacerbated especially for people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.590" end="00:21:09.690" style="s2">are not familiar with mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.380" end="00:21:12.660" style="s2">with being able to be aware of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.690" end="00:21:16.140" style="s2">their thought process is is I&#39;m frozen</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.660" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">I&#39;m like you said Jubilee fully</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.140" end="00:21:20.460" style="s2">identified with my career which I can no</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:23.270" style="s2">longer do so now I&#39;m a failure as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.460" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">human you know I&#39;m frozen in place and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.270" end="00:21:27.330" style="s2">because I can&#39;t work and all of my</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:29.850" style="s2">identity was wrapped up in what I did</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.330" end="00:21:34.050" style="s2">for work I am a complete failure as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.850" end="00:21:35.220" style="s2">human being and that loop yeah there we</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.050" end="00:21:37.140" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.220" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">I kid I can&#39;t tell where the camera is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.140" end="00:21:43.710" style="s2">that loop getting sucked into it that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:46.950" style="s2">get that cut will drag you down you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.710" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">faster than anything I think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.950" end="00:21:50.790" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:52.230" style="s2">between fight flight and freeze is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.790" end="00:21:54.510" style="s2">fighting flying are the two that were</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.230" end="00:21:57.210" style="s2">there for a really long time freeze was</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.510" end="00:21:59.309" style="s2">- it just wasn&#39;t really your adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.210" end="00:22:02.100" style="s2">kicks in and you either fight on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.309" end="00:22:03.540" style="s2">lion the stress your boss goes away or</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:05.220" style="s2">you don&#39;t I mean like the adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.540" end="00:22:06.929" style="s2">Peaks and then it goes down and same</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.220" end="00:22:08.700" style="s2">with flight you run away and then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.929" end="00:22:10.170" style="s2">thing is no longer chasing you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.700" end="00:22:14.130" style="s2">and your adrenaline can come down</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.170" end="00:22:16.170" style="s2">whereas with fries nothing changed like</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.130" end="00:22:17.640" style="s2">and so even though you&#39;re kind of coming</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.170" end="00:22:19.920" style="s2">out of it there isn&#39;t that spike and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.640" end="00:22:21.630" style="s2">then coming down so it&#39;s like like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.920" end="00:22:23.550" style="s2">need to truly change in order for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.630" end="00:22:25.560" style="s2">situation to change it&#39;s like you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.550" end="00:22:26.520" style="s2">to come back from fries and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.560" end="00:22:30.030" style="s2">know how to do that because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.520" end="00:22:31.620" style="s2">have mindfulness or whatever option you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.030" end="00:22:33.150" style="s2">have it&#39;s like the things still there</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.620" end="00:22:34.650" style="s2">you&#39;re still not employed the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.150" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">still have you&#39;re still locked inside</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.650" end="00:22:38.550" style="s2">and like any of the coping mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:39.960" style="s2">you had probably aren&#39;t applicable you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.550" end="00:22:42.360" style="s2">can&#39;t even really go up for a run in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.960" end="00:22:43.860" style="s2">lot of places right you can&#39;t how do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.360" end="00:22:46.110" style="s2">exercise at home it&#39;s just not the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.860" end="00:22:47.730" style="s2">to stand in place and run right in or do</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.110" end="00:22:49.290" style="s2">jumping jacks when like what you needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.730" end="00:22:51.780" style="s2">was to get away from your family what</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.290" end="00:22:54.840" style="s2">you needed was to like go for a walk and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.780" end="00:22:56.820" style="s2">and and gather your thoughts and like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.840" end="00:22:59.160" style="s2">feel I did that a couple times a week</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.820" end="00:23:01.110" style="s2">and I feel like we&#39;re doing it now like</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.160" end="00:23:05.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like can I even go to the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.110" end="00:23:07.470" style="s2">place it&#39;s kind of a skinny path so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.070" end="00:23:11.370" style="s2">people walk both way it&#39;s like if anyway</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.470" end="00:23:13.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like is it important enough to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.370" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">it and yes it probably is for your</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.860" end="00:23:17.010" style="s2">mental and physical health that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:20.160" style="s2">important enough and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.010" end="00:23:22.110" style="s2">then we have this sense of well because</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.160" end="00:23:23.610" style="s2">if everyone went out and did that a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.110" end="00:23:25.950" style="s2">times a day then we wouldn&#39;t be doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.610" end="00:23:29.970" style="s2">social distancing so it&#39;s like how much</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.950" end="00:23:31.350" style="s2">are we allowed and then if you someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.970" end="00:23:33.210" style="s2">using more than that I want to call the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.350" end="00:23:34.800" style="s2">cops I want to like you know like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.210" end="00:23:37.800" style="s2">they&#39;re using more than my a lot in time</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.800" end="00:23:39.750" style="s2">when in reality some people just like</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.800" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">every facet of our economy and human</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.750" end="00:23:44.280" style="s2">nature are going to need more and some</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">people are gonna need less and they</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.280" end="00:23:48.360" style="s2">actually don&#39;t want to leave their</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:50.460" style="s2">houses they&#39;re like there would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.360" end="00:23:52.200" style="s2">enough no we can&#39;t go to the beaches no</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.460" end="00:23:55.620" style="s2">we can&#39;t do things that you concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.200" end="00:23:59.400" style="s2">people but there&#39;s enough outside in our</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.620" end="00:24:00.450" style="s2">places that we can do that it&#39;s okay if</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.400" end="00:24:01.920" style="s2">someone needs to be outside eighty</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.450" end="00:24:03.720" style="s2">percent of their day as long as there</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.920" end="00:24:05.610" style="s2">aren&#39;t six feet away from other people I</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.720" end="00:24:08.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it&#39;s gonna be like for</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.610" end="00:24:09.690" style="s2">them to be cooped inside but can you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.460" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">figure it out because there probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.690" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem fair but like both of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:14.810" style="s2">things at the same time we&#39;re unique and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:17.430" style="s2">different we have different needs and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.810" end="00:24:20.700" style="s2">also we need to work on this together</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.430" end="00:24:21.960" style="s2">and everyone needs to change a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.700" end="00:24:23.429" style="s2">bit like</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.960" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">my kids an extrovert and I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.429" end="00:24:27.360" style="s2">introvert so because she goes to school</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:29.940" style="s2">because I have things like cohousing I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:32.039" style="s2">can&#39;t I figured out how to get her</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.940" end="00:24:35.070" style="s2">social needs met without me necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.039" end="00:24:36.840" style="s2">meeting them that&#39;s not happening for</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.070" end="00:24:40.649" style="s2">the next five to six months which means</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.840" end="00:24:43.260" style="s2">I have to put more in than I was that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.649" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">I&#39;m actually capable of and forgive</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.260" end="00:24:47.669" style="s2">myself for that I&#39;m not capable of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:49.980" style="s2">right like both at the same time find a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.669" end="00:24:51.539" style="s2">way to do it without it being stressful</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.980" end="00:24:55.289" style="s2">because then I go into freeze I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.539" end="00:24:57.179" style="s2">sleeping for a couple days well it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:36.330" end="00:31:40.200" style="s2">you know like the freezing being</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.309" end="00:31:44.309" style="s2">essentially permanent right because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.200" end="00:31:46.830" style="s2">get into this I see no way out of being</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.309" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">frozen therefore I remain frozen kind of</p>

<p begin="00:31:54.539" end="00:31:58.380" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.760" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">earlier right that in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.380" end="00:32:03.390" style="s2">people either find something in</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:05.970" style="s2">themselves or they will not right and</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:31.020" style="s2">default position and it might be because</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.750" end="00:32:32.809" style="s2">as you said people just don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.020" end="00:32:36.330" style="s2">tools right it&#39;s not in our culture</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.740" end="00:32:57.960" style="s2">well and it&#39;s interesting because as</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.960" end="00:33:06.539" style="s2">with 12-step I kind of I&#39;m seeing people</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.390" end="00:33:08.100" style="s2">you know up their intake of whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.539" end="00:33:10.770" style="s2">is that they&#39;re taking and it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.100" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">interesting to see it&#39;s like they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.770" end="00:33:14.270" style="s2">know if it if it&#39;s pot or alcohol or</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.270" end="00:33:19.040" style="s2">you know upping their intake to deal you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.760" end="00:33:20.510" style="s2">know deal with this and if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.040" end="00:33:23.990" style="s2">aware that that&#39;s what you know that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.510" end="00:33:25.940" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing getting stuck</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.990" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">in that it&#39;s getting stuck in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.940" end="00:33:31.429" style="s2">pattern it&#39;s John Verbeck he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:35.470" style="s2">like this the reciprocal narrowing where</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.429" end="00:33:40.790" style="s2">you get into that addictive behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.470" end="00:33:44.450" style="s2">once the threat is you know gone a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.790" end="00:33:49.070" style="s2">example is is Vietnam almost all of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.450" end="00:33:52.160" style="s2">a huge portion of the vets in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.070" end="00:33:54.980" style="s2">were doing heroin 15 percent of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.160" end="00:33:58.400" style="s2">when they got back couldn&#39;t stop you</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.980" end="00:33:59.720" style="s2">know most of the 85% got black they</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.400" end="00:34:02.150" style="s2">could just stop because they were no</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.720" end="00:34:03.410" style="s2">longer in the life-threatening situation</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.150" end="00:34:05.720" style="s2">they were no longer seeing those things</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.410" end="00:34:09.830" style="s2">and they could just stop but some</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.720" end="00:34:13.010" style="s2">percentage of them you know 15% couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.830" end="00:34:15.639" style="s2">they just couldn&#39;t stop and so how you</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.010" end="00:34:18.139" style="s2">know not only dealing with the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.639" end="00:34:20.600" style="s2">crisis you know mental health crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.139" end="00:34:24.740" style="s2">the moment but this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.600" end="00:34:27.889" style="s2">prolonged thing what we saw I think what</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.740" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">we saw in 2008 was it was just a start</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.889" end="00:34:34.790" style="s2">of what this was you know I and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:39.080" style="s2">actually think we&#39;re in I feel hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.790" end="00:34:41.629" style="s2">that maybe and this is only because in</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.080" end="00:34:43.639" style="s2">2008 I had no sense of any of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.629" end="00:34:45.530" style="s2">and I was dealing I was using all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.639" end="00:34:48.590" style="s2">of things to deal with the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.530" end="00:34:51.590" style="s2">anxiety and everything else now it seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.590" end="00:34:54.889" style="s2">like there is more conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.590" end="00:34:57.800" style="s2">mental health around how you know why</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.889" end="00:35:00.260" style="s2">you the eye is important because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.800" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">know people need to you know what do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.260" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">do when you have a whole group of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:10.180" style="s2">who have no sense of purpose all those</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:12.530" style="s2">things so I think is like for me I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.180" end="00:35:16.070" style="s2">definitely know that my addiction has</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.530" end="00:35:17.540" style="s2">had like the more anxious I am the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.070" end="00:35:19.250" style="s2">stress I&#39;m under it&#39;s harder don&#39;t smoke</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.540" end="00:35:21.170" style="s2">pot it&#39;s harder not to consume media at</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.250" end="00:35:24.500" style="s2">the same time it&#39;s also the time I need</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.170" end="00:35:27.490" style="s2">it so it&#39;s finding the balance between</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.500" end="00:35:28.930" style="s2">allowing the self medication we</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.490" end="00:35:32.500" style="s2">found it getting worse and worse and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.930" end="00:35:36.490" style="s2">worse and not let me make it worse like</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.500" end="00:35:40.060" style="s2">a like accepting the substance use and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.490" end="00:35:42.490" style="s2">the media addiction for what it is has</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.060" end="00:35:44.950" style="s2">helped me go through this like ascending</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.490" end="00:35:47.560" style="s2">spiral where it&#39;s like I&#39;ll have like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.950" end="00:35:49.240" style="s2">bad a bad period and then also go off of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.560" end="00:35:51.580" style="s2">it for a while I with only positive</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.240" end="00:35:52.600" style="s2">office media but I get bored with it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.580" end="00:35:55.720" style="s2">then I end up doing something more</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.600" end="00:35:57.580" style="s2">productive on board but like this every</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.720" end="00:36:00.010" style="s2">time I go through a cycle it has less</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.580" end="00:36:02.260" style="s2">and less grip on my life but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.010" end="00:36:04.450" style="s2">absolutely can go the other way where</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.260" end="00:36:06.820" style="s2">you&#39;re off of works you&#39;re smoking pot</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.450" end="00:36:08.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s like oh I&#39;m smoking pot I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.820" end="00:36:10.810" style="s2">like I am a STONER I am the person just</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.980" end="00:36:12.790" style="s2">sitting around playing video games all</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.810" end="00:36:13.990" style="s2">day and then you use more of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.790" end="00:36:17.110" style="s2">you know like it&#39;s this downward spiral</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.990" end="00:36:19.450" style="s2">versus my acceptance has been an upward</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.110" end="00:36:21.130" style="s2">spiral of like okay yeah you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.450" end="00:36:23.170" style="s2">if you need to do this to get through</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.130" end="00:36:25.270" style="s2">life for two weeks that&#39;s it just feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.170" end="00:36:27.220" style="s2">your feeling and then when I get to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.270" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">place rub numbs and I feel gross about</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.220" end="00:36:31.720" style="s2">the numbing that I can I can generally</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.670" style="s2">go off of it for a period of time feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.720" end="00:36:35.260" style="s2">the intense emotion get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.670" end="00:36:37.210" style="s2">where then like I can start using it</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.260" end="00:36:39.310" style="s2">again and then it&#39;s like goes through a</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.210" end="00:36:40.990" style="s2">cycle because abstinence both because</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.310" end="00:36:43.690" style="s2">both of them are things that I do need</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.990" end="00:36:48.820" style="s2">for not me and medication and just in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.690" end="00:36:51.100" style="s2">their world of boredom and yet I I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.820" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">to find that balance there abstinence</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.100" end="00:37:01.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t isn&#39;t an option for me Erik I want</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.710" end="00:37:04.150" style="s2">to circle back to something you said</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.000" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">when you shared because we&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:37:12.990" end="00:37:17.500" style="s2">granted the United States I think is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.820" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">probably gonna be a bigger show</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.500" end="00:37:25.810" style="s2">than in other countries and I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.710" end="00:38:03.869" style="s2">there&#39;s also like the framing of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.559" end="00:38:05.450" style="s2">because yeah we can one way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.869" end="00:38:09.089" style="s2">at this is we&#39;re going through trauma</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.450" end="00:38:11.730" style="s2">another way of looking at it is that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.049" end="00:38:53.279" style="s2">really beautiful frame in which to put</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.559" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">our behavior right but it also in a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.279" end="00:38:57.150" style="s2">absorbs as a responsibility right go</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:38:58.710" style="s2">ahead go ahead that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.150" end="00:39:00.750" style="s2">supposed to do consume consume consume</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.710" end="00:39:04.549" style="s2">you know what I mean and say there there</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.750" end="00:39:07.380" style="s2">is there is that danger to it I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.549" end="00:39:08.849" style="s2">but it also is it&#39;s an addiction that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.380" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">need to be able to process and go</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.849" end="00:39:14.250" style="s2">through like we feel that excess anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:15.690" style="s2">and excess and so like if we&#39;re needing</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.250" end="00:39:18.390" style="s2">comfort food and we&#39;re needing to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.690" end="00:39:19.829" style="s2">that I think that if again in six months</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.390" end="00:39:22.200" style="s2">or a year we&#39;re still eating at that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.829" end="00:39:25.410" style="s2">same level no probably not healthy for</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.200" end="00:39:27.210" style="s2">your body but like right now to give</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.410" end="00:39:29.640" style="s2">people a little more permission to fall</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.210" end="00:39:31.079" style="s2">apart without society falling apart like</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.640" end="00:39:35.369" style="s2">societies where you&#39;ve got to do what</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.079" end="00:39:36.900" style="s2">it&#39;s doing you know the notion of it you</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.369" end="00:39:38.460" style="s2">know that&#39;s what caterpillars are</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.900" end="00:39:40.770" style="s2">supposed to do is consume everything in</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.460" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">their path with no regard for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.770" end="00:39:44.670" style="s2">consequences to the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:47.460" style="s2">consuming right all they do is consume</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.670" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">at bats they&#39;re going to metamorphose</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.460" end="00:39:52.170" style="s2">into this thing and so the the notion is</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">that all of that was worth it right</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.170" end="00:39:56.050" style="s2">because it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:59.980" style="s2">in the service of the becoming of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.050" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">beautiful thing but my point is that if</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.980" end="00:40:07.150" style="s2">you accept that analogy then it takes</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:09.700" style="s2">any restriction off of you right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.150" end="00:40:11.829" style="s2">it&#39;s good right greed is good again</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.700" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">right you&#39;re taking as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.829" end="00:40:15.400" style="s2">consuming as much as you can as good</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.690" style="s2">because you&#39;re working towards being a</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.400" end="00:40:18.520" style="s2">butterfly do you see what I mean did you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.690" end="00:40:21.339" style="s2">see the danger in that but I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.520" end="00:40:22.810" style="s2">so the other way that it&#39;s like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.339" end="00:40:24.700" style="s2">already been like that for everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.810" end="00:40:26.859" style="s2">else right like oh you want 15 yachts</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.700" end="00:40:28.270" style="s2">and 30 cars there&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.859" end="00:40:30.130" style="s2">butterfly but if you want you know I</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.270" end="00:40:33.430" style="s2">mean eat a kind of ice cream for dinner</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.130" end="00:40:35.740" style="s2">you&#39;re a glutton Lee lazy sloth and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.430" end="00:40:38.950" style="s2">allowing people the freedom to be like</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.740" end="00:40:40.359" style="s2">again comfort food is comfort food your</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.950" end="00:40:43.089" style="s2">we might not be getting through this</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.359" end="00:40:44.920" style="s2">with with um you know not everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.089" end="00:40:46.540" style="s2">gonna be eating organic Whole Foods I</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.920" end="00:40:48.010" style="s2">know I haven&#39;t been for the last few</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.540" end="00:40:50.859" style="s2">years because I did give myself</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.010" end="00:40:53.109" style="s2">permission not to be gluttonous but just</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.859" end="00:40:55.690" style="s2">like if I had such a low appetite that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.109" end="00:40:58.150" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t eat for days or I&#39;d eat a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.690" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">bit I was like eat what you want I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.150" end="00:41:04.450" style="s2">care if it&#39;s it&#39;s like orange Cheetos</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:06.490" style="s2">eat calories and it helped me in a much</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.450" end="00:41:07.810" style="s2">better way than like this obsession with</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.490" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">eating everything to be organic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.810" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">everything to be whole foods I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:13.300" style="s2">want to eat it it&#39;s like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:15.579" style="s2">solid I just bought salad for the first</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.300" end="00:41:17.349" style="s2">time in a very long time let&#39;s see we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.579" end="00:41:22.780" style="s2">see if it goes out in the box like it</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.349" end="00:41:24.010" style="s2">usually does the Eric I totally hear</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.780" end="00:41:27.220" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying and I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.010" end="00:41:32.109" style="s2">difference between someone being in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.220" end="00:41:33.640" style="s2">position of mindfully doing it and work</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.109" end="00:41:40.329" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.640" end="00:41:40.930" style="s2">justifying and not fueling the shame</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.329" end="00:41:44.260" style="s2">spiral</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.930" end="00:41:47.829" style="s2">hmm no no I agree I agree I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.260" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">saying if there&#39;s a line there is a line</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.829" end="00:41:52.060" style="s2">and you know they&#39;re you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:54.220" style="s2">they&#39;re you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.060" end="00:41:57.910" style="s2">line between I&#39;m being gentle with</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.220" end="00:41:59.859" style="s2">myself and I am giving myself permission</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.910" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">to behave in a way that I know is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.859" end="00:42:06.970" style="s2">right yeah yeah you know like this</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.310" end="00:42:11.470" style="s2">weekend I you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.970" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">I needed to cocoon a little bit and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.470" end="00:42:14.770" style="s2">ended up spending all day Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">watching Picard and all they Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.770" end="00:42:21.130" style="s2">watching Tiger King are all they send</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:24.130" style="s2">entire King and like it was a train</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.130" end="00:42:26.710" style="s2">wreck and it was terrible and yet there</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.130" end="00:42:27.910" style="s2">was something emotionally satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.710" end="00:42:32.109" style="s2">about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.910" end="00:42:34.990" style="s2">and like I need it and like my husband I</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.109" end="00:42:37.329" style="s2">don&#39;t I have a really hard time giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.990" end="00:42:40.089" style="s2">myself permission to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.329" end="00:42:42.460" style="s2">allow me to relax like I don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.089" end="00:42:44.650" style="s2">and so my husband was like can you</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.460" end="00:42:46.359" style="s2">dressed there you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">physical reasons of why I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.359" end="00:42:52.540" style="s2">relax he&#39;s like can you just like accept</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:54.760" style="s2">that that that right now the way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.540" end="00:42:57.190" style="s2">you need to deal with it is by eating</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.760" end="00:42:59.740" style="s2">some Oreos and watching junk television</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.190" end="00:43:01.690" style="s2">he&#39;s like no you&#39;re not going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.740" end="00:43:04.210" style="s2">every day can you just give yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.690" end="00:43:10.839" style="s2">permission to do that for today and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.210" end="00:43:14.550" style="s2">did and that a you know like figuring</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.839" end="00:43:19.300" style="s2">out that balance it&#39;s it&#39;s not a simple</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.550" end="00:43:20.680" style="s2">you know in I love the you know I love</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.300" end="00:43:23.260" style="s2">the analogy of it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.680" end="00:43:27.220" style="s2">figuring out how to walk the beam how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.260" end="00:43:30.520" style="s2">walk on a balance beam and find that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.220" end="00:43:33.369" style="s2">know don&#39;t don&#39;t tip one too far one way</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.520" end="00:43:36.190" style="s2">or the or the other my personality is</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.369" end="00:43:38.920" style="s2">one where I somebody told me this once</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.190" end="00:43:45.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like moderation is that place that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.920" end="00:43:47.140" style="s2">I fly by from one extreme and but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.130" end="00:43:50.410" style="s2">more mindfulness I practice the more I</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.140" end="00:43:54.250" style="s2">become aware of behaviors the more it</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.410" end="00:43:56.410" style="s2">becomes a balance and so but yes I agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.250" end="00:43:59.170" style="s2">with you Eric that there&#39;s that there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.410" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">a balance and it&#39;s funny I almost see</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.170" end="00:44:03.210" style="s2">what you just said the other way that</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:03.210" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.349" end="00:44:10.329" style="s2">how can I put this right so the flying</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.349" end="00:44:12.069" style="s2">from extremes to express extreme is</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.329" end="00:44:14.259" style="s2">actually what you want to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.069" end="00:44:18.069" style="s2">however you want to be doing it in such</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.259" end="00:44:19.809" style="s2">a way that you&#39;re benefiting from it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.069" end="00:44:23.799" style="s2">right not being thrown about in the wind</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.809" end="00:44:27.339" style="s2">but actually experiencing the ya know</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.799" end="00:44:29.709" style="s2">the intensity of life in its full but</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.339" end="00:44:32.039" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.709" end="00:44:34.390" style="s2">articulate is that some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.039" end="00:44:37.180" style="s2">relationship it feels like the some kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.390" end="00:44:41.890" style="s2">of relationship between the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.180" end="00:44:44.559" style="s2">moderate yourself and then thus gaining</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.890" end="00:44:46.239" style="s2">the freedom to go to the extremes or</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.559" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">something like that does that make any</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.239" end="00:44:54.579" style="s2">sense it does the language that John</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:56.589" style="s2">rebecky uses is he talks about she talks</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.579" end="00:45:02.559" style="s2">about having an optimal grip on life and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.589" end="00:45:04.359" style="s2">yeah yeah and you know and Jubilee I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.559" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">appreciated what you talked about about</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.359" end="00:45:10.390" style="s2">the you know with your smoking pot and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:12.699" style="s2">it like there&#39;s he also talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.390" end="00:45:17.380" style="s2">this concept of a reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.699" end="00:45:19.329" style="s2">and a reciprocal opening and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.380" end="00:45:21.459" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing being like you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.329" end="00:45:24.430" style="s2">this is the only thing that I can you</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.459" end="00:45:27.249" style="s2">know that this is the only thing I can</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.430" end="00:45:29.049" style="s2">do to deal with this particular whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.249" end="00:45:31.690" style="s2">it is like it&#39;s a fear and so I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.049" end="00:45:35.319" style="s2">this medication or I&#39;m taking this drug</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.690" end="00:45:39.549" style="s2">or whatever and a the the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.319" end="00:45:41.890" style="s2">opening of okay there is more ways to</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.549" end="00:45:44.999" style="s2">look at this than just this one way and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.890" end="00:45:48.130" style="s2">again it getting more expansive and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.999" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">finding out and and that not just being</p>

<p begin="00:47:07.500" end="00:47:14.789" style="s2">one criticism I have of the game be</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.480" end="00:47:18.420" style="s2">conversation is you know don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.789" end="00:47:20.039" style="s2">perfection be the enemy of the good or</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.420" end="00:47:21.569" style="s2">so there&#39;s a phrase and I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.039" end="00:47:23.630" style="s2">exactly what it is was like don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.569" end="00:47:25.980" style="s2">perfection be the enemy of good enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.630" end="00:47:27.720" style="s2">yeah don&#39;t let it don&#39;t let it start</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.980" end="00:47:33.690" style="s2">stopped you from starting down the road</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.720" end="00:47:37.619" style="s2">kind yeah don&#39;t let perfection be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.690" end="00:47:41.579" style="s2">enemy of good like it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.619" end="00:47:43.020" style="s2">yeah I like that I like that okay what</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.579" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">are we gonna you know we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.020" end="00:47:48.089" style="s2">gonna let ourselves fall apart here for</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">a little for a period of time and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.089" end="00:47:52.910" style="s2">pick ourselves back up and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:55.529" style="s2">to do it perfectly that is one of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.910" end="00:47:57.299" style="s2">right I mean Jordan Jordan I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.529" end="00:47:58.380" style="s2">sure that you know it a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.299" end="00:48:00.150" style="s2">of that and a little bit less of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.380" end="00:48:02.430" style="s2">you know what I mean and then as long as</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.150" end="00:48:03.809" style="s2">you can consistently not every day not</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.430" end="00:48:05.220" style="s2">all the time you know I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.809" end="00:48:08.099" style="s2">gonna up from time to time but</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.220" end="00:48:09.510" style="s2">again broadly speaking so long as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.099" end="00:48:11.279" style="s2">can broadly speaking you&#39;re doing a bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.510" end="00:48:14.910" style="s2">more of that a bit less of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.279" end="00:48:18.630" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s good stuff and I think but</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.910" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">I think that collectively there is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.630" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">black and white thinking I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:27.619" style="s2">again a John burr of a key term of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:30.299" style="s2">the society this the cultural grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.619" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">you know all or nothing you know like</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.299" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it has to be all or not</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">and how do we collectively loosen our</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:42.119" style="s2">grip on if it&#39;s not perfect that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:43.380" style="s2">know it&#39;s not all our fault I was just</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.119" end="00:48:45.390" style="s2">thinking as you were saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.380" end="00:48:47.250" style="s2">know this happens in films all the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.390" end="00:48:50.010" style="s2">right where one incident or one</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.250" end="00:48:51.480" style="s2">conversation or one whatever all of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.010" end="00:48:52.710" style="s2">sudden it changes their lives forever</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.480" end="00:48:55.230" style="s2">right they&#39;re a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.710" end="00:48:58.019" style="s2">person from that moment on and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.230" end="00:48:59.579" style="s2">we sort of at some levels expect that of</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.019" end="00:49:01.799" style="s2">ourselves right and we&#39;re waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.579" end="00:49:03.510" style="s2">that pivotal moment to come along that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.799" end="00:49:08.069" style="s2">going to transform us into the thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.510" end="00:49:12.779" style="s2">that we want to become not like you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.069" end="00:49:15.059" style="s2">this six minute montage yeah for years</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.779" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">that like and then you come out the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.059" end="00:49:19.650" style="s2">other side and everything like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:22.410" style="s2">there are times my husband and I&#39;ll make</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.180" end="00:49:58.529" style="s2">that like it&#39;s not life changing and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.579" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">once I let go that my life had to look</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.519" end="00:50:07.109" style="s2">lifestyle but once I got that that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.009" end="00:50:09.059" style="s2">never supposed to be how I changed I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.109" end="00:50:11.039" style="s2">always supposed to do incremental it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.059" end="00:50:12.359" style="s2">supposed to be like you know celebrate</p>

<p begin="00:50:29.730" end="00:50:34.500" style="s2">can&#39;t see it but it&#39;s like the internal</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:36.359" style="s2">part and the whereas people I said this</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.500" end="00:50:38.430" style="s2">might just be my version of what she</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.359" end="00:50:39.839" style="s2">does to me but it&#39;s like you don&#39;t look</p>

<p begin="00:51:06.070" end="00:51:10.390" style="s2">risk and then risk is high and risk is</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.170" end="00:51:16.090" style="s2">low whereas I don&#39;t I need my life to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.390" end="00:51:21.070" style="s2">much more calm and yet because I just do</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.090" end="00:51:22.810" style="s2">like I accept where I am I&#39;ve gotten so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.070" end="00:51:24.190" style="s2">much further than I ever I would have</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.810" end="00:51:25.570" style="s2">done following it her way and she</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.190" end="00:51:25.810" style="s2">probably would be miserable doing it my</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.570" end="00:51:27.580" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.810" end="00:51:31.020" style="s2">like the incremental change like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.580" end="00:51:34.750" style="s2">not far enough I need the up-and-down so</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.020" end="00:51:37.300" style="s2">that&#39;s who I was I was the you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.750" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">massive up and down and I still like am</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.300" end="00:51:43.480" style="s2">getting you know it&#39;s like it was this</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.240" end="00:51:47.170" style="s2">and now it&#39;s like you know not quite as</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.480" end="00:51:51.340" style="s2">much but it&#39;s yeah I have had to get to</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.170" end="00:51:54.700" style="s2">that place of the accepting where I am</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.340" end="00:51:58.450" style="s2">and I stand and my thinking can still</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.700" end="00:52:00.310" style="s2">get wrapped up block into like no</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.450" end="00:52:01.630" style="s2">because sometimes like I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.310" end="00:52:03.880" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;ve heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.630" end="00:52:05.140" style="s2">like once I figured out how to like not</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.420" end="00:53:33.970" style="s2">this but there&#39;s the notion of you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:37.120" style="s2">only fully know yourself through the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.970" end="00:53:40.330" style="s2">eyes of the other right and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.120" end="00:53:43.390" style="s2">that that that the feedback that we get</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.330" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">from others is a really really really</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.390" end="00:53:47.050" style="s2">important part of how we you know shape</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:48.600" style="s2">ourselves and develop ourselves and move</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.050" end="00:53:51.460" style="s2">forward in life right whether we</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.600" end="00:53:53.830" style="s2">consciously process that or not and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.460" end="00:53:58.660" style="s2">this idea of I don&#39;t give a what</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.830" end="00:54:00.520" style="s2">other people think that&#39;s I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.660" end="00:54:03.460" style="s2">fantasy jeannot I mean I think to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.520" end="00:54:06.660" style="s2">degree yeah this variation sure but</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.460" end="00:54:09.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the it&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.660" end="00:54:12.550" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the extremes</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.460" end="00:54:17.590" style="s2">cuz there&#39;s the I didn&#39;t know who I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.550" end="00:54:21.790" style="s2">without other people&#39;s opinions and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.590" end="00:54:24.580" style="s2">moving towards the okay you know the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.790" end="00:54:27.300" style="s2">sovereign but the the sovereignty like</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.580" end="00:54:30.550" style="s2">okay I&#39;m I&#39;m a little bit more sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.300" end="00:54:32.830" style="s2">now than I was before because before I</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.550" end="00:54:34.540" style="s2">had no sense of who I was other than</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.830" end="00:54:38.140" style="s2">what other you know what other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.540" end="00:54:41.560" style="s2">thought of me yeah so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.140" end="00:54:43.600" style="s2">balance and I am what came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.560" end="00:54:46.060" style="s2">Ericka&#39;s you were saying that was Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.600" end="00:54:48.220" style="s2">Peterson talking about how we or</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.060" end="00:54:50.200" style="s2">outsource our sanity to other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.220" end="00:54:52.920" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s scary</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.200" end="00:54:52.920" style="s2">about this situation</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.050" end="00:54:59.820" style="s2">right is that you&#39;re you know what if</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.400" end="00:55:03.210" style="s2">the person that you&#39;re quarantined with</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.820" end="00:55:06.580" style="s2">they&#39;re just their their image of you is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.210" end="00:55:08.260" style="s2">incredibly distorted and you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.580" end="00:55:12.270" style="s2">the person that you&#39;re outsourcing your</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.260" end="00:55:16.119" style="s2">sanity to is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.270" end="00:55:18.220" style="s2">emotionally unstable like how does that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.119" end="00:55:21.160" style="s2">you know you&#39;re gonna end up with people</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.220" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">you know in even more emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.160" end="00:55:28.329" style="s2">fragile situations yeah no I mean I know</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:29.710" style="s2">for me I have given less of a than</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.329" end="00:55:32.109" style="s2">I ever did because I had social anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.710" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">and so all I would do after I went to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.109" end="00:55:36.970" style="s2">party was sit for weeks and yeah believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:38.950" style="s2">I said that I can&#39;t believe it means you</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.970" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">don&#39;t go out and do things right and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.950" end="00:55:45.670" style="s2">I have 99% dismantled that because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:47.950" style="s2">realized that like what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.670" end="00:55:50.710" style="s2">me has he is not at my business and what</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.950" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">I think about you is my business that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.710" end="00:55:55.869" style="s2">where I have is like when somebody hurts</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:57.910" style="s2">me when I&#39;m annoyed by somebody else if</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.869" end="00:56:00.310" style="s2">I am ever like I can&#39;t believe they said</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.910" end="00:56:02.950" style="s2">that about someone else which is also I</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.310" end="00:56:04.570" style="s2">realized that I very rarely do that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.950" end="00:56:05.980" style="s2">don&#39;t obsess what someone else said for</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.570" end="00:56:08.440" style="s2">a week I only obsess about what I said</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.980" end="00:56:10.660" style="s2">for a week but I just heard someone I</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.440" end="00:56:12.609" style="s2">remember who it was say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.660" end="00:56:15.460" style="s2">gonna butcher this but there&#39;s like who</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.609" end="00:56:17.109" style="s2">I think I am there&#39;s who you think like</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.460" end="00:56:20.020" style="s2">the world thinks I am and there&#39;s who I</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.109" end="00:56:22.930" style="s2">actually am and the closer those three</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.020" end="00:56:24.910" style="s2">things are the happier you are like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.930" end="00:56:27.130" style="s2">more you&#39;re like I don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.910" end="00:56:28.510" style="s2">something else for you which is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.130" end="00:56:31.869" style="s2">piece that I&#39;ve worked on more or less</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.510" end="00:56:33.160" style="s2">is like I was free I was masking and</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.869" end="00:56:36.069" style="s2">pretending to be something else and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.160" end="00:56:38.470" style="s2">thought everyone was and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.069" end="00:56:39.849" style="s2">everyone is but to a different extent so</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.470" end="00:56:41.589" style="s2">it&#39;s like if we&#39;re all pretending to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.849" end="00:56:43.300" style="s2">someone instead of actually being</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.589" end="00:56:46.710" style="s2">someone I don&#39;t have the energy to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.300" end="00:56:48.819" style="s2">pretend to be anyone but who I am and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.710" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">putting those three things more in</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.819" end="00:56:53.710" style="s2">alignment of like I am what you get when</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:55.869" style="s2">you you like you so what do you see is</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.710" end="00:56:58.750" style="s2">what you get I the more I Know Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.869" end="00:57:01.450" style="s2">the more I can act like that and who I</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.750" end="00:57:03.280" style="s2">actually am I mean we kind of are all</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.450" end="00:57:05.079" style="s2">are actually the same it&#39;s like all this</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.280" end="00:57:09.190" style="s2">stuff on top of it that we&#39;ve put on top</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.079" end="00:57:11.859" style="s2">and so and I know that the less of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.190" end="00:57:13.630" style="s2"> I give about the individuals in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.859" end="00:57:15.609" style="s2">world the more I can work towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.630" end="00:57:17.530" style="s2">creating a world that works for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.609" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">because most of what doesn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.530" end="00:57:22.230" style="s2">the world right now is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:25.350" style="s2">people to see us in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.230" end="00:57:27.510" style="s2">and we need other people to need to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.350" end="00:57:29.550" style="s2">seen in a certain way like it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.510" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">just about I need to be this person that</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.550" end="00:57:32.700" style="s2">you all can look up to it&#39;s like I need</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:34.109" style="s2">you to be trying to be someone I can</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.700" end="00:57:35.490" style="s2">look up to otherwise why the am I</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.109" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">wasting all that energy you&#39;ve gotta</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.490" end="00:57:39.930" style="s2">waste that energy too and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">needing everyone to show up like you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.930" end="00:57:44.100" style="s2">even though you&#39;re not showing up like</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:47.400" style="s2">you are and it&#39;s like all of this wasted</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.100" end="00:57:49.140" style="s2">wasted genius and energy that could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.400" end="00:57:52.380" style="s2">going into doing what you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.140" end="00:57:55.010" style="s2">here to do which rarely looks like</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.380" end="00:58:02.119" style="s2">society&#39;s version of success in my</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.010" end="00:58:02.119" style="s2">experience it&#39;s interesting because the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.109" end="00:58:07.050" style="s2">one of the things that I one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.609" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">things I&#39;ve had to come one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.050" end="00:58:12.090" style="s2">conclusions I had to come to is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:13.500" style="s2">no such thing as wasted energy the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.090" end="00:58:16.740" style="s2">reason that there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.500" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">wasted energy is because for me there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.740" end="00:58:22.550" style="s2">because I had to go through that to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:25.170" style="s2">learn what I needed to learn yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.550" end="00:58:27.930" style="s2">you know it that was one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.170" end="00:58:30.030" style="s2">like and I still and I still struggle</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.930" end="00:58:32.160" style="s2">with that sometimes is like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.030" end="00:58:33.810" style="s2">this voice that says you&#39;re wasting time</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.160" end="00:58:37.619" style="s2">you&#39;re not getting this done and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.810" end="00:58:39.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like no I am learning I am</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.619" end="00:58:41.609" style="s2">constantly learning</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.000" end="00:58:45.810" style="s2">I am constantly and a lot of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.609" end="00:58:48.869" style="s2">the minutia of my thinking of how am I</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.810" end="00:58:50.700" style="s2">go you know going into comparison how am</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.869" end="00:58:54.840" style="s2">I going into judgment how am I going</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.700" end="00:58:57.060" style="s2">into you know comparison and judgment of</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.840" end="00:58:59.760" style="s2">myself are the two biggest ones like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.060" end="00:59:01.980" style="s2">I spend like the number of times I catch</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:04.470" style="s2">myself throughout the day being in</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.980" end="00:59:07.020" style="s2">comparison to other people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.470" end="00:59:09.420" style="s2">significantly less but it&#39;s still like</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.619" end="01:01:49.500" style="s2">is a big thing I&#39;ve I think what the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.970" end="01:01:51.120" style="s2">world is about to go through is because</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.500" end="01:01:53.010" style="s2">comparison is the thief of joy you</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.120" end="01:01:55.020" style="s2">cannot be happy comparing yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.010" end="01:01:56.610" style="s2">other people because you&#39;re never unless</p>

<p begin="01:02:00.360" end="01:02:05.370" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like it&#39;s the thief of joy</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.940" end="01:02:06.930" style="s2">but scarcity is very much that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.370" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">just do I have enough food it&#39;s do I</p>
