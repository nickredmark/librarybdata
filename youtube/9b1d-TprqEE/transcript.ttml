<p begin="00:03:53.959" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t think it that made a difference I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.159" end="00:04:03.229" style="s2">think the film kind of ends as to where</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:06.949" style="s2">these guys are now they are not in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.229" end="00:04:09.169" style="s2">good place they just are you know in the</p>

<p begin="00:04:15.470" end="00:04:21.259" style="s2">for a brief moment again then not to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.870" end="00:04:23.450" style="s2">have seen it at all he thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.259" end="00:04:24.150" style="s2">fixed he was four he came out and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.450" end="00:04:29.160" style="s2">said I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.150" end="00:04:31.350" style="s2">six I and he was four you know probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.160" end="00:04:34.919" style="s2">four weeks completely and then eight</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.350" end="00:04:37.800" style="s2">weeks kind of and then 16 weeks little</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.919" end="00:04:40.020" style="s2">lessons on him and now he&#39;s back so back</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.800" end="00:04:41.820" style="s2">to where he was maybe maybe even worse I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.020" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know so I&#39;m glad it showed that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.820" end="00:04:45.030" style="s2">very mixed picture because it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.590" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">important message especially in these</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:49.410" style="s2">times of so much enthusiasm in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:50.520" style="s2">circles of people that have know about</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.410" end="00:04:53.070" style="s2">psychedelics it&#39;s still a very small</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.520" end="00:04:54.539" style="s2">little niche but for people in that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.070" end="00:04:56.130" style="s2">world although they&#39;ve experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.539" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">themselves and had a profound benefit</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.130" end="00:05:01.110" style="s2">there&#39;s so much hope so what does the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">story tell us about the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.110" end="00:05:06.840" style="s2">this therapy why does it work and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:09.330" style="s2">could it work better the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.840" end="00:05:11.220" style="s2">that it really is a process it really is</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.330" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">the beginning of a journey so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.220" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">very powerful entry into a journey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">a very strong beginning and it can</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:19.889" style="s2">achieve in one session what normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:22.139" style="s2">thirty might take a long time to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.889" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">it&#39;s very experiential it&#39;s very real</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.139" end="00:05:27.419" style="s2">but it&#39;s the start of a journey it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:29.010" style="s2">the end of the journey so there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.419" end="00:05:30.210" style="s2">units like peeling an onion there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.010" end="00:05:34.440" style="s2">layers and there&#39;s more layers and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.210" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">layers so and the idea that I mean some</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.440" end="00:05:39.599" style="s2">people have had these kind of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:41.340" style="s2">experiences where they they have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.599" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">experience where they feel they suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.340" end="00:05:44.070" style="s2">see themselves in the world in such a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">different way that that kind of changes</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.070" end="00:05:47.400" style="s2">everything they don&#39;t fear death anymore</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:53.909" style="s2">and the way they see other people is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.400" end="00:05:57.780" style="s2">different that does happen but from what</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.909" end="00:06:00.889" style="s2">we saw in the last study most people</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.780" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">have suffered from depression again now</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.889" end="00:06:06.060" style="s2">and and they have really really wanted</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:07.380" style="s2">for the psychedelic work that is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.060" end="00:06:09.210" style="s2">work that they would have wanted</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.380" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">is there a tension between because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.210" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">of time with with the medical model the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.490" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">idea is you take a pill and it has this</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:18.169" style="s2">effect on you like it&#39;s a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:20.970" style="s2">material idea or a very mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.169" end="00:06:22.380" style="s2">assumption it feels that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.970" end="00:06:23.639" style="s2">something very different going on with</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.380" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">psychedelics do you think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.639" end="00:06:28.949" style="s2">there&#39;s a weird tension I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:31.169" style="s2">very good tension because I think the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.949" end="00:06:33.150" style="s2">tension that is there has the power to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.169" end="00:06:34.919" style="s2">really transforms our system of care I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.150" end="00:06:36.660" style="s2">think what psychedelics bring about is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.919" end="00:06:38.670" style="s2">this absolute paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.660" end="00:06:40.650" style="s2">in the you can&#39;t use psychedelics in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.670" end="00:06:43.170" style="s2">that way psychedelics will never be able</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.650" end="00:06:45.210" style="s2">to safely be put into a kind of conveyor</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.170" end="00:06:46.920" style="s2">belt system of care they will radically</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">transform any system of care they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.920" end="00:06:52.440" style="s2">brought into because in order to do them</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:54.090" style="s2">safely you need all the things I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.440" end="00:06:56.970" style="s2">are important for therapeutic changes to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.090" end="00:06:58.410" style="s2">happen so you absolutely cannot give a</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.410" end="00:07:04.320" style="s2">proper trust and that means proper trust</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.290" end="00:07:06.120" style="s2">that they have for themselves for the</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.120" end="00:07:09.810" style="s2">substance like proper proper trust and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.250" end="00:07:11.340" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t get developed overnight you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.810" end="00:07:13.770" style="s2">have to you know you have to spend the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.340" end="00:07:15.660" style="s2">time getting to know someone before that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.770" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">can develop there&#39;s also this importance</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.660" end="00:07:18.350" style="s2">of being very real and in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:20.610" style="s2">relationship with with the person</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.350" end="00:07:22.140" style="s2">because you are about to embark on this</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:27.960" style="s2">these capsules of psilocybin and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.280" end="00:07:30.660" style="s2">could go anywhere they could go back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.960" end="00:07:32.040" style="s2">a traumatic experience in their life</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.660" end="00:07:35.100" style="s2">that is they feel they&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.040" end="00:07:37.530" style="s2">again they could be crying in pain they</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.100" end="00:07:39.450" style="s2">could be facing something absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.530" end="00:07:40.740" style="s2">petrifying terrifying but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.450" end="00:07:42.270" style="s2">understand I know what it is but feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.740" end="00:07:43.920" style="s2">that they&#39;re being pulled apart they</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.270" end="00:07:45.270" style="s2">could die they could feel it not</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.920" end="00:07:46.620" style="s2">literally dying they could feel they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.270" end="00:07:50.010" style="s2">having what it&#39;s like an ego death</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:52.590" style="s2">experience and feel that they&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.010" end="00:07:55.500" style="s2">or exploding or you know it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.590" end="00:07:57.510" style="s2">very intense and they can have sweet</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.500" end="00:08:00.840" style="s2">blissful experiences of oneness and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.510" end="00:08:02.010" style="s2">connection to all things but you just</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.840" end="00:08:03.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know where they&#39;re going to go but</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.010" end="00:08:05.070" style="s2">you have to be with them when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.390" end="00:08:06.780" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a roller coaster and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.070" end="00:08:10.410" style="s2">you have to be there on the seat next to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.780" end="00:08:11.850" style="s2">them wherever they go so there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.410" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">space for some kind of slightly</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.850" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">disengaged half their relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.610" end="00:08:17.820" style="s2">you might have in normal psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.580" style="s2">services because you see people for an</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.820" end="00:08:23.220" style="s2">hour every hour this is a full day</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.580" end="00:08:24.540" style="s2">together and you get to a very real</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.220" end="00:08:27.150" style="s2">place and you get to know each other as</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.540" end="00:08:29.250" style="s2">people human beings it&#39;s not doctor</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.150" end="00:08:31.590" style="s2">patient or therapist patient at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.250" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">two human beings doing something very</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.590" end="00:08:37.289" style="s2">human and profound together as you sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:39.210" style="s2">of just said then a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.289" end="00:08:41.370" style="s2">psychedelics can give an insight but</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.210" end="00:08:44.280" style="s2">often that insight will be something you</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.370" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">need to work on it won&#39;t be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.280" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">connection to everything and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">suddenly feeling like much more whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:53.670" style="s2">can be while I never realized that I had</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:55.830" style="s2">this pattern or I had this pattern we</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.670" end="00:08:59.180" style="s2">behave like this and then it&#39;s up to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.830" end="00:09:01.500" style="s2">to do the work to make yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.180" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">which is which is very different to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.500" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">kind of classical medical model yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:06.450" style="s2">a very much an active process not</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.430" end="00:09:08.579" style="s2">something that just happens to you I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.450" end="00:09:12.120" style="s2">mean the fact that the experience itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.579" end="00:09:13.350" style="s2">can be quite grueling is is really this</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.120" end="00:09:14.730" style="s2">will be the start of that process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:16.410" style="s2">not something to be done like me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.730" end="00:09:18.870" style="s2">it&#39;s all about willingness willingness</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.410" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">to surrender to open up to to feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.870" end="00:09:24.510" style="s2">things and yeah I mean it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:27.029" style="s2">that the day itself which can be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.510" end="00:09:29.670" style="s2">like a really hard slog exhausting you</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.029" end="00:09:31.050" style="s2">know six or seven hours of different</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.670" end="00:09:33.720" style="s2">emotional experiences exhausting for</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.050" end="00:09:35.670" style="s2">people and they can cry more than have</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.720" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">cried in the whole lives they can feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.670" end="00:09:40.350" style="s2">even the ecstatic states can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:42.300" style="s2">physically tiring but then yeah after</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.350" end="00:09:45.240" style="s2">that there is this people often describe</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.300" end="00:09:46.769" style="s2">for a few weeks after or maybe even a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.240" end="00:09:48.570" style="s2">bit longer this sense of spaciousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.769" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">and openness afterwards that having been</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.570" end="00:09:52.290" style="s2">stuck in very fixed patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:54.180" style="s2">elimination they suddenly feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.290" end="00:09:56.040" style="s2">lights were turned on or they feel a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.180" end="00:09:57.740" style="s2">freer and there&#39;s more clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.040" end="00:10:00.120" style="s2">there&#39;s this we think it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.740" end="00:10:01.560" style="s2">window of opportunity in terms of brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.120" end="00:10:02.790" style="s2">flexibility there&#39;s things are more</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.560" end="00:10:04.500" style="s2">flexible for a certain amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.790" end="00:10:06.029" style="s2">afterwards and then it might get harder</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.500" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">to change habits because things get more</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.029" end="00:10:10.740" style="s2">set in stone again but there is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:12.420" style="s2">window flexibility where if people want</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.740" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">to change their behaviour in that time</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.420" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">that is really the key time for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:19.529" style="s2">therapy to maximize that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:22.170" style="s2">possibility but if people are on their</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.529" end="00:10:24.029" style="s2">own you know people have the experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.170" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">and then in our study people have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.029" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">experience then they go back to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">communities that don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:29.820" style="s2">about it necessarily or doctors that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:30.810" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything about it and family</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.820" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">members that aren&#39;t really sure about</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.810" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">how it works and they might have ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:37.410" style="s2">about what they want to change but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:39.209" style="s2">think people in future as we optimize</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.410" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">these treatments people will benefit</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.209" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">from having much more much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.630" style="s2">therapeutic support in those first weeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">to really help people determine okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.630" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">what&#39;s going to be different now I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:50.610" style="s2">seen this I felt this what am I actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:53.339" style="s2">going to do tomorrow to start changing</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.610" end="00:10:54.660" style="s2">the patterns sitting as a therapist and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.339" end="00:10:57.750" style="s2">one of these sessions is a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.660" end="00:11:01.260" style="s2">you&#39;re witnessing somebody choreograph</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.750" end="00:11:02.730" style="s2">their own very very unique therapy</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.260" end="00:11:04.660" style="s2">session</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.730" end="00:11:06.040" style="s2">they go in ways that you could never</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.660" end="00:11:07.959" style="s2">have predicted or even design yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.040" end="00:11:09.579" style="s2">because they&#39;re so subtle so you go into</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.959" end="00:11:11.110" style="s2">the session you don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.579" end="00:11:12.220" style="s2">really you understand that someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.110" end="00:11:14.829" style="s2">suffering from depression but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.220" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">really know why or how and they will go</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.829" end="00:11:22.930" style="s2">through a sequence of visions or lessons</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:24.759" style="s2">or they&#39;ll go from here to here and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.930" end="00:11:25.899" style="s2">it&#39;ll change and it&#39;ll shift into</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.759" end="00:11:26.829" style="s2">something else and at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.899" end="00:11:28.269" style="s2">when they&#39;re talking through their</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.829" end="00:11:29.649" style="s2">experience you&#39;re left with this</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.269" end="00:11:32.680" style="s2">profound sense of respect for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.649" end="00:11:35.800" style="s2">process that that person&#39;s unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.680" end="00:11:37.930" style="s2">mind was somehow able to take them on</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.800" end="00:11:39.790" style="s2">this journey back towards some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.930" end="00:11:43.259" style="s2">health or a journey with a step in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.790" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">direction of balance and health so</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.259" end="00:11:47.709" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s so exciting to me the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:50.019" style="s2">that we hold within artists potential</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.709" end="00:11:51.579" style="s2">for rebalancing that it&#39;s not coming</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.019" end="00:11:53.829" style="s2">from a therapist the therapist in</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.579" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">psilocybin therapy do very little really</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:11:59.560" style="s2">space and some of the experience of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.180" end="00:12:01.750" style="s2">kind of things can come up so people can</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.560" end="00:12:03.459" style="s2">feel trust view but essentially it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.750" end="00:12:05.889" style="s2">about the person themselves and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.459" end="00:12:07.540" style="s2">happening within them and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.889" end="00:12:11.470" style="s2">most exciting thing because that is what</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.540" end="00:12:14.440" style="s2">gives me hope that I mean how could a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.470" end="00:12:16.089" style="s2">manual that&#39;s been written or helped</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.440" end="00:12:19.209" style="s2">everybody how could some very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.089" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">like kind of rigid template ever be</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.209" end="00:12:22.709" style="s2">right for everybody we&#39;re all world</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:25.389" style="s2">within ourselves we&#39;re all unique</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.709" end="00:12:27.730" style="s2">universes so it something that allows</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.389" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">those universes to inside each of us to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.730" end="00:12:31.630" style="s2">come in balance I think we could see a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">massive change in how effective</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.630" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">treatments are because they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:38.350" style="s2">worked that well up to now I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:40.269" style="s2">like talking therapies announcer</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.350" end="00:12:41.949" style="s2">depressants worked for like half 50% of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.269" end="00:12:43.630" style="s2">people it&#39;s a lot of people that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.949" end="00:12:45.339" style="s2">helped by them this could really change</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.630" end="00:12:48.189" style="s2">our healthcare systems and is there one</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.339" end="00:12:51.490" style="s2">particular thing that you think people</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.189" end="00:12:53.649" style="s2">maybe on the outside of psychedelic this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.490" end="00:12:56.649" style="s2">this subject maybe don&#39;t understand but</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.649" end="00:13:00.009" style="s2">should understand I think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.649" end="00:13:02.949" style="s2">they&#39;re nonspecific amplifiers so what</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.009" end="00:13:06.630" style="s2">that means is that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.949" end="00:13:09.759" style="s2">inherently good or inherently bad and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.630" end="00:13:11.139" style="s2">some people often people describe it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.759" end="00:13:12.550" style="s2">after a psychedelic experience they feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.139" end="00:13:13.030" style="s2">more connected to themselves and other</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.550" end="00:13:14.410" style="s2">people in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.030" end="00:13:18.370" style="s2">around them and they feel much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.410" end="00:13:20.290" style="s2">concerned about protecting nature and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.370" end="00:13:23.650" style="s2">actually they might feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.290" end="00:13:25.420" style="s2">more concerned I mean after near-death</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.650" end="00:13:26.530" style="s2">experiences people come away from them</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.420" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">and off and feel that they&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.530" end="00:13:28.960" style="s2">they&#39;ve changed their life and they want</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:30.520" style="s2">to do things for other people rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.960" end="00:13:32.230" style="s2">than worrying about material things it</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.520" end="00:13:34.510" style="s2">can be that same kind of thing a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.230" end="00:13:37.450" style="s2">awakening of what&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.510" end="00:13:39.490" style="s2">however there&#39;s a romanticized view that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.450" end="00:13:40.990" style="s2">giving psychedelics to people would make</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.490" end="00:13:42.190" style="s2">everything better there have been people</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.990" end="00:13:44.140" style="s2">in the past they&#39;ve used them and have</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.190" end="00:13:45.670" style="s2">become the kind of Messiah Complex has</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.140" end="00:13:48.430" style="s2">got stronger and stronger and they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.670" end="00:13:49.870" style="s2">become much more narcissistic lots of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.430" end="00:13:51.220" style="s2">people that use psychedelics regularly</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.870" end="00:13:53.260" style="s2">have become much more narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.220" end="00:13:55.510" style="s2">through that practice rather than less</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.260" end="00:13:59.650" style="s2">so they definitely don&#39;t strip away the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.510" end="00:14:01.720" style="s2">ego for everyone so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.650" end="00:14:03.280" style="s2">necessarily good but that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.720" end="00:14:04.210" style="s2">they&#39;re not necessarily bad I mean a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.280" end="00:14:06.310" style="s2">of people have the view that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.210" end="00:14:08.590" style="s2">psychedelics will make them go crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.310" end="00:14:10.380" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s absolutely not true</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.590" end="00:14:13.720" style="s2">either somewhere in the middle at this</p>
