<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">and dialogue about what matters most at</p>

<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening now</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">stoa is a digital campfire where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.880" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">gather to coherent dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:27.920" style="s2">at the knife&#39;s edge of what matters most</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:29.439" style="s2">and today</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.920" end="00:00:31.519" style="s2">is the third of a series that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.439" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">doing with samoa berger</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.519" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">i think i have that right called live</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:38.320" style="s2">players</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">so uh we&#39;ll be doing a talk followed by</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.320" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">a q a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:44.800" style="s2">and uh with that i hand it over to samo</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.559" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">thanks for being here uh thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.800" end="00:00:49.360" style="s2">having me as always</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:52.480" style="s2">and uh yeah like the series and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.360" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">the series is entitled live players and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.480" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">one of the more interesting things and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">the interesting implications</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">is where would we actually go</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">next in just a second</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">surprisingly warm day</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">so the question is where would we go</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">next were there live players who wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">properly reform our institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">reorganize our society what might that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">and i think that one of the very basic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">changes i</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:25.520" style="s2">think we should see at almost every</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">level of society</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.520" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">is to have dominance of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">rather than of systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">so the presence and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:38.560" style="s2">express the actions of coherent minds</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">rather than adhering to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.560" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">processes and protocols that were set</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">into place not even that long ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:47.439" style="s2">chesterton&#39;s fence applies to a fence</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">that&#39;s been there for 500 years</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.439" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">it does not apply to something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">been there for 50 years or</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">20 years a lot of the bureaucratic red</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">tape we&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.439" style="s2">so used to is stuff that&#39;s only been</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">developed in the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">or 50 years a lot of the ideologies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">propose</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">that you know human individual action is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">unimportant or</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">irrelevant or inappropriate or that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2">unusual</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">thinking or that you know extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.920" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">changes in a person&#39;s life are unheard</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">this seems like it&#39;s been there since</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">time immemorial but i actually think</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">it is ratcheted up over the last 40</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:26.800" style="s2">possibly starting as early as the middle</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.800" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">possibly later in like the 1970s but</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">i think you know i think 40 years is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">probably the best approximation and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">think it tracks</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">fairly naturally a different statistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">map the distance that children are</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">allowed to roam</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">under on their own unsupervised by</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.319" style="s2">from the home throughout the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">century you start with</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">this vast radius of 20 miles it shrinks</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">to 5 miles</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">it shrinks to 1 mile and today it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.959" style="s2">100 feet</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">right so if you&#39;re a miner you&#39;re a kid</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.959" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">you on average</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t allowed to go more than 100 feet</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:08.080" style="s2">from your home i think we&#39;re approaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">conditions of home arrest</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.080" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">and home arrest together with school</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">arrest</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">means that these are you know fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">incarcerated human beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">i think this shows up in the adults as</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">well i think the adults have</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">less ability to roam now perhaps they</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">can you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">hop on a plane they can well at least</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">they could until 2020</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">and they go very far in terms of miles</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">but they don&#39;t go very far</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">in terms of cultures you fly 4 000 miles</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">you visit europe you visit north africa</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">southeast asia</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">and you never left a hotel right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">always there in the simulated experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">of an identical culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">so i think the affordance to go into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">different mode of living</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">and come back from it to the midstream</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">switch careers</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">and break the tracking pattern i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">much harder now than 30 40 or 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">i also think that there&#39;s strong</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">that this kind of narrowing effect is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">partially</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">driven by the development of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">panopticon</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">we&#39;re all building the panopticon</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">together right it&#39;s not the case that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">we needed invasive intrusive</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">sort of like heavy-handed government</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">action it&#39;s just that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">freely gave the information to both</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">the recommendation engines that enable</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">consumerism and our general you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">pattern of consumerism so we were very</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">happy when</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">amazon read our information and gave us</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">better and better recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">we&#39;re very happy when the search engine</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">seems to work better we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">care if it tracks us</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">and on the other hand we want to project</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">the amish i think are not like supremely</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">advanced they&#39;re in some ways you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">i mean perhaps they&#39;re objectively</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">advanced but this is a throwback right</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">there used to be more things like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">can we imagine opposite day or a digital</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">like i think we&#39;re way too uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">for that i think we feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">much too precarious to make fun of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">idols or</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">imagine a day where democrats are</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">supposed to be republicans and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">republicans are supposed to be democrats</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">like i think people are too inflexible</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">both internally</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">and interpersonally for that so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">narrowing range of the roaming of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">children is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">a symptom though also a cause right</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">but mostly a symptom of the narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">range of risks</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">we feel comfortable with because these</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">are again not fundamentally physical</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">risks in terms of physical risks</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">even with the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">we are right now much much physically</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">safer than hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">but i think we feel and project onto</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:10.319" style="s2">these physical risks and we flee away</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">from the physical risks</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.319" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">because we become hypersensitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">hypersensitized to the social risks</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">and this kind of need</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">for a particular kind of social approval</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">and a very consistent life story</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">that we can present not just</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">bureaucratically which is an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">problem right</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">you always need it you know here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">document that proves that i was</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">conscripted already you can&#39;t conscript</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">me again</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">here&#39;s the document that proves i paid</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">bureaucratic legibility we</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve always had that or rather um you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">know we&#39;ve had it for let&#39;s say 20 000</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">or 10 000 years i have a contrarian</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">thesis that actually we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">writing uh for much longer than usually</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">acknowledged right</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">probably all the way to the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">last ice age</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">all the way from the end of the last ice</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">age but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">took take the the normal you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">consensus history view of 10 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">as long as we&#39;ve had writing we have had</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">to impose bureaucratic legibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">on organic lives and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">now uh we also have a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">compatibility where</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">because there&#39;s this record that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">can always mine for previous comments</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">and pictures we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">socially stuck to be much more legible</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">than even kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">the rural the the word of mouth history</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">that a village might uh engage with</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">again social media mob and a village</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">they both might know you about equally</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">well or rather they can access the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">but you are far less powerless</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">interfacing with the village</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">now agreed a village can probably also</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">just kill you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">and for now a social media mob cannot</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">just kill you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">but you have very little power over the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">social media mob</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">compared to the individual relationships</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:03.519" style="s2">you could leverage in a village in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:05.279" style="s2">village so</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.519" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a social self-consistency</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">enforcement and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">finally there&#39;s like a national security</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">uh apparatus of significant weight</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">that&#39;s been fully assembled and i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">deployed to different political purposes</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">in the very near future</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">okay so a lot of topics dropped them all</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">i proposed a few mechanisms i&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">now double click on whatever part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">seemed the most interesting and uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">possibly if there are questions that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">stand out i can</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">answer them immediately</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">great so uh if you would like to put a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">proposition or a question into the chat</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">i will then call your name and you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">ask your question directly to samo</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">and then we&#39;re kind of going to allow</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">for an etiquette of a back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">but uh one round of back and forth and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">then we&#39;ll go to the next person</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">so we already have some</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">propositions and questions from from dan</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">dan would you like to unbeat yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">i guess i didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t mean to be</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">i just was triggered by what i was</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">hearing and making comments</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">you mentioned something at some point</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">about uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">the digital environment playing a big</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">you know the development of digital</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">technology and social at least for</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">people under 25 i think it&#39;s a primary</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">component of socialization</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">um arguably for people under 35 that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">already existed but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">i think people between 35 and 25 grew up</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">text-based pseudonyms were the main mode</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">of interaction i do post on forums you</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">send you know emails whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t necessarily use your own</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">face as your avatar on a forum in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">early 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">yeah yeah and i&#39;m thinking back to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">mid 90s when i was one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:11.680" style="s2">people on the on the internet um</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">it was completely text-based you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.680" end="00:12:17.680" style="s2">that that was before</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:17.680" style="s2">any graphics were there um okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">i i can i can see that to some level</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">there there yes there is some</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">socialization there</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">but i would i would i would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">independent of that as a separate strain</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:33.320" style="s2">even if we took that out i think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">there&#39;s been an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.320" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">bureaucratization</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">of organizations and an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">clamping</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">down by the elites in these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">and and a and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:54.639" style="s2">an increasing fear of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">the one who questions the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.639" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">even if only innocently</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">questions the i you know not even aware</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">of the danger of the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">right right and of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">there&#39;s you know a thousand points of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">doctrine that you might get wrong</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">right or even hidden or inexplicit</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">um so it&#39;s very easy to ask that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">accidental question</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">um i think that i think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">like i said i opened with about 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:26.639" style="s2">now we&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">increasing escalation so that predates</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.639" end="00:13:31.360" style="s2">the judge the digital world</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">um and i think that partially comes out</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.360" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">of well there&#39;s several competing</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">explanations right</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">i think there is eric weinstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">of the embedded growth obligation where</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">he proposes that most of our</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">or even you know ultimately governments</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">were predicated on perpetual growth</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">and in the absence of this growth they</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">cannot deliver on the implicit promises</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">in the academic system this shows up</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">where most grad students</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">the the graduate student was originally</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">performed their task as cheap lab labor</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">essentially or you know assistance to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">the professor</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">and this is something he speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">very eloquently he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">a paper on the topic and he also talks</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">about like the economics of</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">knowledge work i think that certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">contributes a different story is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">story of like ideological shift</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">uh you have a left-wing story and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">right-wing story on this</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">the left-wing story is about the slow</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">dominance of neo-liberalism that hollows</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">out all</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">ideological alternatives where things</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">are exposed over and over again to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">open market where</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">losses are socialized and profits are</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">privatized</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">and then the right-wing version of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:57.839" style="s2">story is the world where there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">slow march through the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.839" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">where over time say critical theory has</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">been over applied</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">and has deconstructed the basic values</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">of society</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">in the absence of those values of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">traditional modes of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">what you&#39;re stuck with is this very</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">minor and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">very tight rule uh rule adhering process</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">right where you&#39;re trying to write all</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">the rules for all the places where you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">might encounter harm</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">right so a social conservative would say</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">argued that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">campus rape culture is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">consequence</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">of uh sexual liberation on campus or</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">a more extreme conservative would just</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">say it&#39;s a consequence of having co-ed</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">colleges</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">right so because they would take a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">pessimistic view on human nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">now again these are like three stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">now and i can easily tell two more</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">uh two more stories i would like to tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">which i actually think</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">i feel capture this fairly well and are</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">not necessarily incompatible</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">with the eric weinstein story i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very i think it&#39;s very insightful</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">in its own right</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">one is the succession problem where i</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">think the people currently running</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">the set of elites sorry the current set</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">of elites that&#39;s running the current</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">are possibly on the older end baby</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">boomer generation a few might be silence</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">a lot of them are say very older gen x</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">range right if you look at the average</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">age of ceos it&#39;s around 50 years old</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">these aren&#39;t the people who built these</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">institutions in the first place so</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">often they just lack a lot of the tacit</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">knowledge needed to run this well</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">so the first story is one of outright</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">succession failure</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">where there&#39;s a failure in skill</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">succession and the second one i would</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.880" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">advance</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">is that of a centralized declining</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:44.959" style="s2">empire this is from</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">empire theory you can read about it in</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.959" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">my document titled</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">great founder theory so a subset of</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">is empire theory mostly deals with power</p>

<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s been in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">centralized declining empire what</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">happens is</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">necessarily comes into conflict so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">center the high power in society comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">in conflict with the middle layer of</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">because they are constantly</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">and giving back to different parts of</p>

<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">now high mid and low aren&#39;t like classes</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">in a marxist sense or in a classical</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">class analysis sense these are</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">power classes in the sense that you</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">individual is high middle</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">or low right so again we&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">necessarily talking about individual</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">um so i think these two kind of go hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">in hand you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">a succession failure that&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">followed by</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">an extractive mode of institutions that</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">because their legitimacy still rests in</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">uh they have as a story of legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">uh this this uh growth narrative that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">no longer there</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">i think like people you know of the baby</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">boomer generation i think they believe</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">that they would live to see the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">singularity i mean it&#39;s 2020.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">where&#39;s the singularity right</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">singularity would be a straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">extrapolation</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">of what growth should have brought had</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">it continued from 1970 in a compounding</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">cool very happy to to go to the next</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">question i think i uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">hopefully that was is a solid answer</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">great thank you so really great question</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">from anish</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">would you like to mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">um should i read the question out</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">yes please okay all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">hi um so</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">give me a moment yeah so one thing uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">that somewhat surprised me</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">when i initially came to the us you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">i mean it wasn&#39;t immediate but over time</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">i started to notice it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">um was that there seems to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">complete lack of what you would call</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">uh bucknellian social</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">uh occasions that are just you pointed</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">this out</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">uh like you said you know opposite day</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">or that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">reversal right i try i try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">closer</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">what carnival used to be than rather</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">what it is currently right people might</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">associate carnival right now with</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">venetian carnival where you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">masks</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">or with brazilian carnival which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">nudity and in a funny way like masks and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">nudity well i&#39;m from san francisco</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">that&#39;s just normal</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not so i try to show how</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">subversive carnival actually was in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">medieval context</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">or possibly you know um uh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:08.480" style="s2">what is the term of homolysis i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.480" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">you have an adverse thing uh an adverse</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">yes thank you yeah um for example small</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">amounts of radiation are very good for</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">the body because they seem to activate</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">regenerative mechanisms in the body</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">similarly with autophagy and fasting</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">exactly so perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">even from a social conservative</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">perspective uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">the carnival and you know festivals were</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">actually extremely good things</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">so uh like i was surprised by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">complete lack of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">i said one somewhat bucknellian social</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">occasions</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.679" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">um and second</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">uh the the dionysian aspect of um</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">culture among the people that i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">sorted into i mean probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">it might be an artifact of the group of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">people that i was sorted into thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.159" style="s2">route that i took to come to the us</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">which is you know upper middle class</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.159" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">professionals of the software type</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">um and um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">but what surprised me was that the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">image that one has of the us when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">from outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">is a significantly more liberated and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">less repressed place</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">as in less less every day regulated if</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">right um and do you think this has to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">like like you said people are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:27.520" style="s2">afraid do you think it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">the rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.520" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">what chapman would call inherent</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">nebulosity</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">as in it seems a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">form the purpose of taking you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">boundaries which might have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">somewhat off perhaps and just</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">acknowledging their nebulosity in sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">providing an avenue like the carnivals</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">or the other things of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">renegotiating the fact that they are</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">nebulous and that they might slowly</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">change over time</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">and so something like this could</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.559" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">generate common knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">about um oh okay turns out that yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">in fact there has been some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">minor shift like is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">maybe a neurosis or just uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">i think it is a it it is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">narrowing of cultural space</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">i think it&#39;s very difficult to settle on</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">exactly the right ontology</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">well i greatly appreciate chapman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">writing i feel the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">classification of belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">culture and values is yet to be written</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">and if we listened to hegel</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">we would also say it can never be</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">written as soon as you write it you need</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">to rewrite it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">you know kind of self-author in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">autopoetic way i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">there is a fragilization</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">of communally</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">accepted principles on which to judge</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:51.520" style="s2">conflict mediation right so conflict</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">mediation and conflict management is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">fact of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">and i think there used to be a very rich</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">vocabulary of many different</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">principles you could invoke on</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">what grounds should we judge this</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">dispute and not even judge in a legal</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">sense just judge in a social sense in</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">you know no matter how tolerant we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">we again we always stay judgmental kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">of as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.480" style="s2">again maybe maybe my perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">someone from san francisco is a little</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.480" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">biased here where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">maximum tolerance and maximum</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.840" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">intolerance of a particular type go</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">very well together but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">that the vocabulary people can invoke or</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">even agree on when it&#39;s appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">invoke has</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">shrunk which means fewer possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">outcomes means conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">less well-suited this means</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">ideological consensus has to be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">rigid office politics has to be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">rigid</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">so i almost would look for this in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">microdynamics of decision making</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">then radiating outward to something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">the narrative rather than</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">the narrative you know infecting or</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">putting pressure on the micro</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">environment of a particular office</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">okay i mean my own experience in the bay</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">area is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">conflict resolution is almost completely</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">broken down and it generally turns</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">into a jockeying for greater victim</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">status and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">everything eventually just degenerates</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">into this is probably abusive</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s the end of it um so</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">thank you thank you thank you for your</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">question but we&#39;ll go for the next one</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">great thank you and we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">a scroll up here to shar</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">would you like to have it yourself sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">um hi</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">samuel um i wanted to ask as we see</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">globalization</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">well i&#39;m not sure we can call it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">receding but</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">uh as you see the cyanosphere increasing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">and maybe a multi-polarity of the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">of course it&#39;s exaggerated the u.s is</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">still quite strong but still</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">do you see more uh possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">uh diverse cultural spaces and an</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">expansion</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">of possibilities the you know like</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">not bring like the lack of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">talking about just going to a similar</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">uh hotel you know it&#39;s all the same all</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">the design looks like starbucks and all</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">but do you see that receding as</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">globalization changes</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">um i think that globalization is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">actually here to stay in the following</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">i think that we might see a receding of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">the entanglement of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:40.240" style="s2">uh you know security fundamentals of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:43.919" style="s2">different countries</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.240" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">we might see a receding in</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.919" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">the hyper centralization or</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">unified vision of the future so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">might have societies fragmented along</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:57.039" style="s2">different visions of the future</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">but i think we won&#39;t see any reduction</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.039" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">in the following things i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">um like how should i illustrate this</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">the european union might actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">politically fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">however the youth of individual european</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">countries have never been more similar</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">in their tastes and their habits of life</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">arguably</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">young europeans and young americans are</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">much more similar today</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">in their consumer habits and their</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">lifestyles than they were 40 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">right so europeans bought more cars</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">americans bought fewer cars</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">you know americans started drinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:37.840" style="s2">belgian beer europeans started eating</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">more hamburgers</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.840" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">it kind of like mellowed out evened out</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">and i think by default what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">to see culturally</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">is a somewhat deglobalized world</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">because elite culture will i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">remain</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">focused on english but i think the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">global internet will fragment first</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">along sovereign lines and secondly</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">along um linguistic lines i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">there&#39;ll be an english-speaking internet</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">then there&#39;ll be a russian internet and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">a chinese internet</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see what other internets might</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">emerge but i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">those will form kind of these closed</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">social spaces so</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">one way to think about that is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">a massive retreat in globalization</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">but i actually think that you know total</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">global cultural diversity will continue</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">to fall</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a few alternative hegemonic</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">but the total cultural diversity in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">world will be smaller</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">and it&#39;ll be more long-distance</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">integration</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">so i still think we&#39;re actually on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">very very slow</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">centuries-long globalization trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:46.720" style="s2">in terms of culture and basically modes</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">of economic production</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.720" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">i have to ask the question you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">we had this narrative of technological</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">where the world used to be developed and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">divided into the first world and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">third world then it became divided into</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">the developed world and the developing</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:07.200" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">the term developing world implies these</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.200" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">countries are going to catch up with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">developed countries</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">i think we&#39;re going to have to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">new terminology</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">because i think a lot of countries are</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">post-industrial</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">in the negative sense so i think many</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">countries will have economies</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:26.399" style="s2">that will actually recede to the state</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">of development we today call</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">developing we might then see a world</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">economically there&#39;s homogenization over</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">time right where</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">living standards in europe and north</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">uh and possibly even some corners of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:43.200" style="s2">east asia converge with those in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.120" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">rest of asia and latin america and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">possibly even</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">the more advanced parts of africa not</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">there has been catch-up growth from</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">everyone so far only china has</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">really done impressive strong catch-up</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">growth but because there&#39;s a decline in</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">living standards in the former first</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">right and this then leads to a world</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">that&#39;s perhaps somewhat more</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">economically decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">but they&#39;re still winners and losers</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">it&#39;s just that they&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">rotating at the table who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">industrial power of this decade or this</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">these next few decades the idea of china</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">one day outsourcing its industrial base</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">and suffering urban blight</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.399" style="s2">might seem ludicrous but it&#39;s far from</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">you know it&#39;s far</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.399" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">from an impossibility we saw the same in</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">uh in britain right and we saw it in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.200" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">and uh i would not at all be shocked if</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a similar development</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s something inherently</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">unstable about being a quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">developed society</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">so if there is something inherently</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">unstable</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">in being a quote unquote developed</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">that&#39;s a very pessimistic view i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">in that case we could see</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">a real receding of globalization</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">not just like this sort of like small</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">detour but</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">an actual failure of globalization right</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">cool all right</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">daniel do you want to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">about ais</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">sure so uh i just had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">whether or not ais can discern live</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">players or ais can become live players</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">and kind of the background for this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">that increasingly as people</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">spend more time on the digital realm and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">as psychographic data becomes more and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">more fine-grained</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">it becomes harder and harder to actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.919" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">distinguish what is the root cause of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">our initial</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">impulse to make a decision in one</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">direction or another so the whole ai</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">thing is being built is inbuilt into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">way the players are playing so</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">i just kind of want to hear you riff on</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.039" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">i think it might be possible to identify</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">live players using artificial</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:54.240" style="s2">intelligence right because i think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:57.519" style="s2">of these mass surveillance systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">are very good at picking up anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.519" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">so i think it could detect</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">relatively quickly unusual or anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">behavior now of course an anomaly could</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:08.320" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">it could be a positive outlier or a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">negative outlier so i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:13.919" style="s2">if you have something that detects live</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">players and it&#39;s automated an automated</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.919" end="00:31:16.640" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.720" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna read and detect a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.640" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">the people who are just doing weird</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">things for the sake of being weird and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no deeper wisdom there no deeper</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">advancement</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">and some of the smaller number of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">who are uh who are doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">poor doing uh unusual or exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">whether ai&#39;s can be live players i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">that just requires</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:41.279" style="s2">general intelligence so that is then</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">rounded off to the question can</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.279" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">artificial intelligence be</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">generally intelligent so you know human</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">human-like in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t see any theoretical reason why</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t but i also see no reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">uh and so i&#39;m assuming it can</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">uh i think we can have you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">human-level intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">but i see no particular reason to expect</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">it in the very near future</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">um just going off of your definition of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">a live player being</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">a person or a group of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:12.880" style="s2">able to do things that they haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.880" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you say that there are some ais</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">that are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">doing that new things that are currently</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">extant so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.600" style="s2">not generalized intelligence i would</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">agree they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.600" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">um in a narrow sense this might fit the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">definition but doesn&#39;t fit the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">the definition of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">experience because the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.159" style="s2">definition is sort of like adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.159" end="00:32:37.519" style="s2">this this ability to adapt to the novel</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:39.679" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.519" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">in an unforeseen way and i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.679" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">there&#39;s any current narrow ai that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">like really adapt in this way</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">excellent peter would you like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">all right samuel what kind of questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">do live players ask</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">well that&#39;s a very good question um but</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.159" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">i think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">i think the the question to ask they ask</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">the kind of questions that allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">quickly figure out</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">where might lie this unusual</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">or very unexploited or very neglected</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">domain of deep knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">so knowledge that actually uh is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:30.559" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">some explicitly stated theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.559" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">material but some deep</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">unstated stuff that&#39;s you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">domain of intellectual dark matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">that&#39;s either you know tacit knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">it&#39;s trade secrets right so i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things they always</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">pursue i think they do pursue</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">this type of knowledge again it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">have to live in books right</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:51.200" style="s2">in fact it lives very well in</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.200" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">the second type of question life players</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">ask often is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">well how does this system behave</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">and they probably don&#39;t even use the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">term system but they will</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">ask questions about how things are done</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">and they&#39;ll ask people who are you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">uh very conventional so they will have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">passion for talking to the conventional</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">and they will have a passion for</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:18.839" style="s2">discerning what life is like for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">normal individual or the everyday</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.839" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">and partially because you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">can figure out how these very</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">predictable patterns work in your live</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">player</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">you can take some really impressive</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">shortcuts</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">and these are not shortcuts in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">of cheats</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">these are ways of achieving the goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">that fulfill both the spirit and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">letter of the law</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">but seem like they should be impossible</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">not just in this legal sense but again</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">in this moral ethical sense this like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">knowledge acquisition sense this</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">economic sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">any sense you want to think about it if</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:57.599" style="s2">they observe the normal world</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">closely if they ask questions to figure</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.599" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">out what&#39;s happening in the normal world</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">and they try to see what is the abnormal</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">world what is the unknown what is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">hidden what is the unaware</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">and you can have this very wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">transfer of one</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:14.839" style="s2">to the other right and that is immensely</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">immensely</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.839" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">profitable if i use a different analogy</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">so spirit or letter of the law is one</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">analogy profit is another analogy</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">you could say advantageous but then all</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">these words are problematic right they</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">already carry</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">they carry this kind of assumption of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">either selfishness or selflessness</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s uh it&#39;s more let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">let&#39;s settle on can be very advantageous</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">can be very empowering</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">right so they either pursue knowledge or</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">they pursue a certain kind of power</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">but when i say power i mean in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">sense that&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">self-centered</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">they they love shaping the world right</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">so all the questions are in service of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s very good to see you again</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">great and jen would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">i&#39;m sure hey summer um i really like</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.560" style="s2">the article uh you wrote about youtube</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">and the knowledge revolution</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:19.119" style="s2">um thank you been such a big part of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">life and also the examples you gave</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.119" end="00:36:23.680" style="s2">um were really memorable for me um but i</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">also when i traveled i&#39;ll never forget</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.680" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">this example of seeing like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">like probably 16 year old monks in burma</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">and like wearing their</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">maroon robes um on their phone playing</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">a cooperative like fighting game um but</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">after they&#39;re done the game they all</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">just watched a shit ton of music videos</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">while still in the monastery and it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">like lil wayne and jay-z</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">and like all that stuff like bugattis</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">and nice cars and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">um so i&#39;m wondering in terms of what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">were saying about</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:57.200" style="s2">the kind of homogenization that happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">what we are</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.200" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">your definition for what globalism will</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">play out i&#39;m wondering what</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">you think about the role youtube has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">play in that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">um do you think it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">do you think it ever has a localism</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">inflection point</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:18.079" style="s2">um or does it kind of continue this way</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">uh i guess the analogy would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">everybody just had to have their local</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">english teacher but when all the english</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">teachers are together everybody can just</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">learn from like the best english teacher</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">and like what&#39;s the point of just</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">learning from subpar english teachers</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">if that analogy makes any sense i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">youtube is preponderately in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">a homogenizing</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">force but there is a counter force here</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">it creates new niches right new niches</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">of knowledge sharing and i wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">this in the article</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">because the means through which to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">record the world i mean i think very</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">these cameras will be more than</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">sufficient for recording even the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">high quality youtube videos right right</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">professional youtubers uh they usually</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">still buy purpose-made cameras</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">but for almost anything uh the you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">digital camera on your phone is</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.960" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">sufficient which means that we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">now record in fine detail action or</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">practice that the documentary filmmaking</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">team would have</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">never recorded right either for an</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">educational purpose like those 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">videos</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">or just for entertainment purpose like</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">1990s discovery channel</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">and this massive recording of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">things in everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">can preserve many practices in a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">you know simply impossible if i go on</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">youtube i&#39;m quite certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:39.760" style="s2">i could find a channel and i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">watched this channel but i&#39;m sure it</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.760" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">on uh you know traditional uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">traditional korean</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">bow carving like i have no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">think their bows are super</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">interesting but i bet that there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">some hobbyists that shoot bows and i bet</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">they&#39;re hobbyists who have tried to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">recreate bows as they existed in korean</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">warfare</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.960" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">and i bet there there are youtube videos</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:03.839" style="s2">of how to make those</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">so in a sense that cultural tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.839" end="00:39:07.040" style="s2">preserved</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">in another sense it&#39;s divorced from</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">context it&#39;s sort of like european</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">martial arts um</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">we all know again east asian martial</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">arts but there was a set of european</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">martial arts that mostly went extinct</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">over the last 200 years or 300 years</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">because warfare in europe changed so</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:27.839" style="s2">dramatically and was so oriented</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">around gunpowder weaponry that all these</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.839" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">ways of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:32.800" style="s2">fighting either with swords or just</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">wrestling in unusual ways were lost</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.800" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">and then recently there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">community that has revived those</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">but this kind of wrestling like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">not wrestling in taverns to settle</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">disputes nor are they fighting with</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">swords on the battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">so kind of the meaning of that has</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">and nothing really prevents you from</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">picking up european martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">as a hobby in vietnam or vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">so i think there is homogenization</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">but hopefully the homogenization</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">preserves</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">some more optionality or variance right</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">so i think that that&#39;s how i would i</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">would propose that works</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">but then i would hear also point and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">push a little bit back</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">uh because i think youtube doesn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t cross borders it&#39;s very easy</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:23.839" style="s2">youtube here</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">we&#39;re only going to have russian youtube</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.839" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">or chinese youtube or american youtube</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">or european youtube</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">at this point maybe it sounds silly to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">propose that the american and european</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">internets</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">might separate one day but they very</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">easily might</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">uh already with the enhanced privacy</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.880" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">rules of europe</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:42.720" style="s2">when i go to europe and try to read the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">la times the website informs me that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.720" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet figured out how to comply</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">with european privacy laws</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">so i just don&#39;t read it right when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">see a paywall or</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">this kind of announcement you don&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">it and you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.680" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">that there would be also differences in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.760" style="s2">legal environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">say the us values free speech more</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.760" end="00:41:04.720" style="s2">europe might value tolerance more</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">so you might have in fact a legal</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.720" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">incompatibility of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">which videos are okay to upload versus</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">in the two large jurisdictions</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">if i so may ask a follow-up then of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">course the the takeaway that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">mind for me then uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:24.480" style="s2">is there&#39;s almost like a strong</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">bifurcation that you can imagine like</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.480" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">even in the way you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:29.920" style="s2">like kind of you get this optionality</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">it seems to me the bifurcation even with</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">that in youtube is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">those who know how to search and use</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">search and those who just click</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">on the videos that show up on home</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:40.640" style="s2">screen um</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">like i notice i use youtube i&#39;m like go</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">carving i don&#39;t know i see an article</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll google it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">but my mom she like never types anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:47.839" style="s2">to the search bar on youtube she&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.839" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">maybe some time ago in the beginning she</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">typed one indian tv show</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">and then just she just watches whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">recommendations that happen well some</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">more interesting way that&#39;s convergence</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">with television no</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">television programming except the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">programming is customized to you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">not channel surfing it&#39;s it&#39;s delivered</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">to you on the basis of the information</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">gathered in the past</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">um i didn&#39;t really have more of a point</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">than that because i&#39;m even thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">the same thing when you&#39;re saying like</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">the european internet will</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">will maybe potentially be different than</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">american internet imagine those with</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">can use telegram or vpns and so on to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">get access to all of the above</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">but there&#39;ll be always a tiny monarchy</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">so i&#39;m just wondering if that&#39;s a mental</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">model that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">well the most natural comparison here is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.800" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">the great firewall of china</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:37.839" style="s2">even today in china it&#39;s very trivial to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">access all</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.839" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">internet sites that you want it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">basically a very minor amount of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">technical sophistication needed</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">but i remember hearing numbers that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">about eight to ten percent of chinese</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">citizens ever do this</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">which is like a very small number you</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:59.280" style="s2">politically in terms of mass</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">mobilization that&#39;s an irrelevant number</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.280" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">so if you buy this bifurcation happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">what what are the implications of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s almost too easy for my mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">to be like bifurcation bad but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">well i think it could be very good i</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">think it could be very good and not</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">intentionally good or designed with good</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">intent</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">but i think it might result in humanity</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">trying out several different things</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s very useful for us to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">try and have several cultural nodes</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">coexisting even if they&#39;re culturally</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">incompatible</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">uh because i think you know if humanity</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">will have</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">issues in the future it will be because</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">we have not tried enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">things right like we won&#39;t we won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">learned the full possibilities i claim</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">that we do not know the full social</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">possibilities of what the technology of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">2020 enables</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">nor do we know the full possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">where technology could develop</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">where social circumstance is different</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">single technological attractor</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">i think that there are massive</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">contingencies right and i base this</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:04.720" style="s2">you know this sort of let&#39;s call it an</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">informed guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.720" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">uh on the history of technology in our</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">own world where the printing press in</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">china versus the printing press in</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">have a completely different sociological</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">effect right</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:20.839" style="s2">because the preconditions when the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">technology enters society are so</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.839" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">next question yeah uh key would you like</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">to ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">yeah hello hello</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">um thank you i did come in late i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.720" end="00:44:44.400" style="s2">acknowledge that first but um the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:46.240" style="s2">question and answers</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.400" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">have been really informative so thank</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.240" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">you and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">my question is related to when you spoke</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">of singularity earlier</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">um so i just was curious about</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">well speaking of what you just spoke</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">about just now which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.119" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">trying out um new things and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">and seeing the bifurcation as in</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">in a good way not good intended way but</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">a way for</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">humans to try different things question</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">goes to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">um what is your view or stance</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">or even maybe plan on pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">um singularity</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">well um i think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">the intelligence explosion version of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">the singularity or the vengeance</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">singularity</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">uh these are like slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">concepts i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">learn i&#39;ll roll them together as in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.480" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">this transcendence of the human</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">condition this mass</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">transformation with technology and an</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">explosion of intelligence information in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">the world right</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.839" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">sociologically viable i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">strange that happened where i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">we hit</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">ever stronger social headwinds</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">the closer we came to possibly achieving</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">a rate of progress that would achieve</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">the kind of compounding growth that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">leads to singularity</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">now i know this is still this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">little contrarian position i think the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">default story is that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">still progressing at a decent speed</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">uh but my my my claim would be that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">there&#39;s something we don&#39;t quite</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">and intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:41.280" style="s2">i think that there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.560" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">counterintuitive there</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.280" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very much unclear so</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">assuming it is possible i would propose</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:51.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:53.200" style="s2">the normal methods of increasing human</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">that that is the closest i can come to a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.920" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">sort of singularity scenario</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">there&#39;s also a world where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">achieved through the design of like you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">know deep mind or open ai succeed and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">they build</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">you know a super intelligent machine in</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">and then that&#39;s the end of the human era</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have to worry about it one</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">way or another</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:42.880" style="s2">but i think that world for various</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">reasons is fairly unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.880" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">if i have to bet and you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">willing to bet because i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">50-year plans instead of five-year plans</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">with my life and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">with my intellectual explorations um i</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">think that that one</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">that route won&#39;t happen so i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">something like you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">maybe the renaissance uh plus</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">information technology</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">plus possibly very adaptive learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">where my phone is you know both</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">collecting information about me</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">but i have the ability to use that data</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.760" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">uh and craft software on my own steam or</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">buy software on my own steam that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">trying to enhance my intelligence rather</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">than take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">of my predictability right so i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">even the current state of information</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">technology could be a significant boost</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">to our intelligence but</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:35.760" style="s2">i do think it takes both the the human</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">side and the software side</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.760" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we can drag humans much</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">more in one direction or another just</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:41.839" style="s2">with software</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">though of course i admire you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.839" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">attempts like rome and so on to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">to be better notetaking systems but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">hope that answers your question it does</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">it really does</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.040" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">can i ask one follow-up question of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">um i just wanted to circle back to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">um social structure element that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">brought up</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">in the beginning of the answer could you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">maybe expand a little bit on that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">why you think that&#39;s a factor</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">for um for sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">betting on the um</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:24.079" style="s2">the deep mind ai open source type way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">thinking of the the future okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.079" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">um it&#39;s not immediately relevant</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">to artificial intelligence though in</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">it is where i will propose that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">let&#39;s examine you know a naive</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">perspective might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:40.720" style="s2">the more money you put into artificial</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:42.640" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">the faster artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">progress so if you went from</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">10 billion dollars to 500 billion</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">invested in ai you should have more</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">technological progress</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:55.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually fairly easy to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:59.280" style="s2">possibly construct the opposite scenario</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.920" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">where 500 billion dollars in ai results</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.280" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">lots and lots of software being</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">reclassified as ai</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">projects there&#39;s an argument to be made</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">that this happened to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">nanotechnology in the 1980s where</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">there was a firm argument that this</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">might be the future</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">you know molecular level machine</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">construction and so on</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">uh a concopia of you know rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">expanding material abundance so there</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">was a lot of government investment into</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">and resulted in a bunch of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:31.960" style="s2">in themselves but</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">boring from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.960" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">nanotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">material science projects starting to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">call themselves nanotech</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">so today there&#39;s probably like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">nanotechnology department</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:44.000" style="s2">in many technical universities around</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">the world but the actual amount of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.000" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">nanotechnology done is very low</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">and some of the people who might have</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">been attracted to the field of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2">nanotechnology</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly compete with all these</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">nanotechnology phds</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s a needle in a haystack if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">try to fund a real version of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">right so there&#39;s this surprising way</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">in which there are some ways you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">envision</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">vastly more resources being spent on</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">scientific progress that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t enable it but chokes it off and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">of course implicitly i think this is at</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">part of the reason why we&#39;ve had such</p>

<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">we just got like so many good questions</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">this is what anjon</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">lashed onto and it was kind of riffing</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">off what you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">uh mentioned earlier about tacit tacit</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">knowledge and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">had stated that uh um</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s good that that that that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">different blocks that there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:17.359" style="s2">there&#39;s not going to be a clear hegemon</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have china and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.359" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">going to have europe</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have north america this</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.920" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">sort of thing and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">um different</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">political economic experiments and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">technologies will be developed and legal</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">systems and so on and so forth will be</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2">developed in these different areas</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">and then you mentioned something earlier</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">about tacit knowledge and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">and i agree that it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">if these different um regions start</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:48.079" style="s2">developing their own things</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">and i lived in china for 10 years so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.079" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">aware i lived on both sides of the great</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">firewall and i experienced the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:55.839" style="s2">difficulty of living out both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:53:57.599" style="s2">the great fire well as well as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.839" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">certainly inconvenient but i do think</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.599" end="00:54:01.520" style="s2">the point about it not being</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">that difficult to avoid uh stands</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.520" end="00:54:03.920" style="s2">because i&#39;ve talked to to others who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">lived in china</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.920" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">and you&#39;ll get around yeah yeah a vpn</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">and easily you can get around it um</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:12.960" style="s2">it can be a hassle at times but my my</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">point is that most</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.960" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">most chinese people for example are not</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">fluent in english</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">yes and that&#39;s kind of the the language</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">barrier</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">the language barrier and there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">only a language barrier there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">culture there</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">and this gets to the your point about</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">the tacit knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">there&#39;s even a big culture barrier</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">between europe</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">and and kind of the neo-liberal</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:38.160" style="s2">libertarian capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">american capitalist as well so um</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.160" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">my point is i think it&#39;s great that</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">these different experiments are</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s an ins i would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:50.720" style="s2">there is an insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">number of people that are bi-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.720" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">or bilingual sorry</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:54:59.599" style="s2">um to take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:00.960" style="s2">of these different experiments so we</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.599" end="00:55:02.319" style="s2">have these wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">experiments that are going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.319" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">world but</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">the the different parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">can&#39;t really take advantage of them</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.319" style="s2">because an</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">insufficient number of people</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.319" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">um in each culture is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:19.520" style="s2">kind of a dual citizen or dual you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">bicultural</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:24.160" style="s2">to to bring that into the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve bifurcated or trifurcated</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.160" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">to such a degree and we&#39;re so polarized</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:31.119" style="s2">that there&#39;s also that that comes into</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:32.640" style="s2">play as well so i was wondering if you i</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.119" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">think this is this is very much</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.640" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">true in the sense that it&#39;s true that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">benefit massively for more people that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">can in fact be bicultural that not only</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">cross</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:44.160" style="s2">a language care barrier but as you noted</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">this much more fundamental cultural</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.160" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">barrier</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">like i guarantee you there is a culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">shock for anyone that moves from</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">new york to san francisco from san</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">francisco to new york it&#39;s subtle</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to call it a culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">shock but it is a culture shock and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">go through the list of like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">symptoms of culture shock which are</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">sometimes physiological symptoms you</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">might have a fever for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">um they experience it and of course they</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">always complain about leaving new york</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.799" end="00:56:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s that they are somehow aware that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">they have been molded by one city</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.880" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">and even though we all speak you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">all speak english a lot of us are</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">immigrants</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:21.280" style="s2">most people are american citizens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">so different</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">so everything said there extends also to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">britain</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">extends to germany so within the western</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">and let alone japan which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:35.119" style="s2">economically integrated but culturally</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">not integrated at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">and in fact japan also has a language</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">barrier and people might not realize</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.079" style="s2">that actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">english fluency is not that good in in</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.079" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">japan</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.799" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">and of course japanese fluency is</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">non-existent in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">this leads me to say something</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">rather interesting right imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">these are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">seeds we&#39;ve planted well we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">to we don&#39;t have to immediately harness</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:02.079" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.839" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">right there&#39;s a bifurcation or</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.079" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">trifurcation or</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">fragmentation of the world but often</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:10.880" style="s2">people learn the most</p>

<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:41.599" style="s2">in fact i can give you a more</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">interesting analogy where arguably the</p>

<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:46.720" style="s2">first is</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">the rise of the nazis causes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.720" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">the intellectually most productive</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">people to flee for the united states</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">and then the fall of the nazis causes</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">the few remaining intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">productive people to flee</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">and this is why germany is like perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">good in industry but is not the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">intellectual frontier anymore</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:03.760" style="s2">and it just was the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">frontier for about 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.760" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">from about 1830 onwards to about 1930.</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:15.359" style="s2">cool next next question can we do like</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">two more questions i know it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.359" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">hour perfect</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">great okay so tyson would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:29.920" style="s2">sure thank you okay so a question</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">yes uh so have cities reached a point of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.920" end="00:59:33.280" style="s2">diminishing returns as far as their</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">ability to extract innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.280" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">productivity</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">from people and will significant amounts</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.079" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">of people move away from cities into</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.160" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">rural areas to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">a new way of living and if so</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">you think it&#39;s likely there will be</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:52.000" style="s2">major efforts from the elites</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">to resist or slow this shift in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.000" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">migration and then if so um like</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">maybe any thoughts about what to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">about that or just</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:03.359" style="s2">yeah how you think about that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">very good question</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.359" end="01:00:06.799" style="s2">i hope the answer is no because if the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">answer is yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:11.119" style="s2">i just believe this means that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">american civilization has entered</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.119" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">terminal decline</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">i can&#39;t think of a single deurbanization</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">in the last 10 000 years</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.319" end="01:00:20.559" style="s2">and no cities are deeply problematic</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">objects right cities are often death</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.559" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">traps</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">they&#39;re often places of misery uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">they&#39;re often places of violence and</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:28.040" style="s2">instability</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.240" end="01:00:30.079" style="s2">but i can&#39;t think of a single case where</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.040" end="01:00:32.160" style="s2">deurbanization happened</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.079" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">i can think of many cases where there is</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.160" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">an expansion where there&#39;s a large</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">rural population where previously it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">just a hunter-gatherer population</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">right say you know colonizing of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">americas right</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">but this this isn&#39;t the the end of</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">cities or the cities being out competed</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:50.480" style="s2">uh usually it&#39;s the case that cities</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">monopolize the best opportunities for</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.480" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">so if we are seeing mass de-urbanization</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">in the us</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.640" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think this is due to like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:01:00.960" style="s2">know there being such</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">amazing opportunities in the countryside</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.960" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">it&#39;s because the cities themselves</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">even after having hogged all the best</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">opportunities in society</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">don&#39;t have much to offer so it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">like growth has been completely choked</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not just zero-sum games because</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">zero-sum games can maintain cities i</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:20.000" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">at least for a while it&#39;s negative some</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:23.040" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">so people flee right the only winning</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:27.359" style="s2">if the only winning move for the game of</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:29.920" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.359" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">is not to play that&#39;s the situation</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.920" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">where you see the urbanization</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">and if the only winning move is not to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">play well then eventually there&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">bank run</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:40.240" style="s2">so i hope that&#39;s not the case and i also</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">think that there will be</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.240" end="01:01:43.920" style="s2">de-urbanization of some american cities</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.920" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">i would not be surprised if chicago</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.839" end="01:01:50.799" style="s2">eventually converges with</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.599" end="01:01:52.559" style="s2">uh other hollowed-out uh great lake</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.799" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">cities such as detroit</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.559" end="01:01:56.400" style="s2">and i would not be surprised if new york</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">significantly stagnates</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.400" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think its population is</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:04.240" style="s2">going to go down</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">uh i also would not be that surprised</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.240" end="01:02:09.440" style="s2">if you see a complete failure of either</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">san francisco or seattle</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.440" end="01:02:13.280" style="s2">so again i think the primary the primary</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">prediction i would make the likeliest</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.280" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">basin you know evidence seems to be in</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">the outcome of a stable san francisco</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:22.160" style="s2">and a growing and technologically</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">innovative seattle</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.160" end="01:02:26.000" style="s2">though the san francisco is kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:28.160" style="s2">a finance center i think it becomes the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.000" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">finance center of the west coast</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.160" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">uh including with its own stock exchange</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">as uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a new one being set up and with</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.760" end="01:02:35.839" style="s2">various financial instruments that will</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.839" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">distant uh legal descendants of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">venture capital industry</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:48.319" style="s2">great and our final question from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:52.559" style="s2">medic</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.319" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">caper hey</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.559" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">so i have a thought that uh language</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">might naturally decay and lose its</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">semantic meaning</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:02.880" style="s2">so it would move from expressive and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">uh to instrumental and profane um</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">i think i think this problem is solved</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:13.839" style="s2">in pre-modern societies through</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:15.839" style="s2">ritual is one way it can also be</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">violence but in modern societies we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.839" end="01:03:19.839" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">tried to replace all that with uh with</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.839" end="01:03:22.480" style="s2">growth like economic growth or</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:25.920" style="s2">technological</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.480" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">innovation um and i was i was wondering</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.920" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">if you think</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:33.280" style="s2">uh this is i guess sufficient to uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:37.039" style="s2">to reify language because if if you have</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.280" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">um no if there&#39;s no like hooks for</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.039" end="01:03:41.039" style="s2">language to dig into in reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">it just starts sliding around and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.039" end="01:03:44.640" style="s2">get people um you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">you talk about scripts right people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.640" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">repeating scripts to get what they</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:49.520" style="s2">they want but the scripts are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">meaningless they&#39;re uh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.520" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">interchangeable right</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">well yes um</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">the scripts are interchangeable</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">but just because you know i think i</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:09.359" style="s2">think behaviorism is is a relatively</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.760" end="01:04:11.680" style="s2">nega is a reasonably negative way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:14.720" style="s2">viewing the human condition</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.680" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">but something along the lines of well</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.720" end="01:04:18.640" style="s2">does the flight of a bird have meaning</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.359" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">so a lot of these scripts are</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.640" end="01:04:24.400" style="s2">meaningless but adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">if this makes sense and they do differ</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.400" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">to each other from each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">in their adaptivity</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.599" end="01:04:33.440" style="s2">yeah well there is a like a physical</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">layer of uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.440" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">objective reality which uh you know you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem you can run into i mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">yeah so either you raiify language</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">some kind of ritual or you just get into</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:50.160" style="s2">serious shit and then and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">to manage it right</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.160" end="01:04:53.520" style="s2">well i think i think language has a</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:54.559" style="s2">wonderful ability to reinvent itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.520" end="01:04:57.119" style="s2">where basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.559" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">subcultural groups might actually have</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.119" end="01:05:00.319" style="s2">higher information</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.400" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">density language right now than</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.319" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">mainstream society</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:05.200" style="s2">because the subculture uses stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.160" end="01:05:07.760" style="s2">not visible</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.200" end="01:05:08.960" style="s2">or intelligible to the outside to</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.760" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">communicate</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.960" end="01:05:12.160" style="s2">highly contextual information meanwhile</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.160" end="01:05:16.160" style="s2">i think for example like if you could in</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">information theory</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.160" end="01:05:19.680" style="s2">measure the amount of information that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">is conveyed</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.680" end="01:05:22.799" style="s2">through the course of a normal political</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:24.079" style="s2">debate or</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.799" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">through the course of a brief</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.079" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2">conversation on wall street today</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.160" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure a lot of information is</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">exchanged i think a lot of very complex</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.160" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">verbal behavior happens but i think very</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:35.839" style="s2">little information is passed through</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">and if i look at some twitter</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.839" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">subcultures i see immense amounts of</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:43.599" style="s2">passed through you know the 280</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:45.440" style="s2">characters available</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.599" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">so i sort of am optimistic in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.440" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">that meaning can be rescued</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.280" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">if only by retreating to the esoteric or</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">retreating to the straussian</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">or retreating to the subrosa layer</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">cool yeah well i&#39;m not i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.640" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">meaning is uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">it&#39;s hopeless i&#39;m not saying that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:07.359" style="s2">saying uh are we sort of at a lack</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:09.359" style="s2">for for means of um</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.359" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">of ensuring this connection between</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.359" end="01:06:13.520" style="s2">language and meaning like is there</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">oh yes yes no no question about it</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.520" end="01:06:17.680" style="s2">language right now</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">and communication and the epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.680" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">commons are</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:23.440" style="s2">really compromised and i applaud any and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:26.000" style="s2">all efforts to improve the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.440" end="01:06:27.920" style="s2">epistemic commons and the communication</p>
