<p begin="00:00:05.490" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">thank you so much I&#39;m very excited I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.050" end="00:00:15.389" style="s2">thankful to get an opportunity to speak</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:19.430" style="s2">on this topic I&#39;ve these days mostly</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.389" end="00:00:22.230" style="s2">been talking about education and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.430" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">educational systems and their role and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.230" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">when I characterize as a global</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">meta-crisis and so I&#39;ve been talking a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.789" end="00:00:32.310" style="s2">lot about education because of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">forthcoming book but in this book</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.310" end="00:00:35.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a chapter which I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">actually maybe the best one if I can say</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.460" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">that and it&#39;s a it&#39;s about measurement</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">it&#39;s about a measurement as a global</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:46.890" style="s2">issue and really about the uniqueness of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">our historical moment from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.890" end="00:00:51.690" style="s2">perspective of the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:54.270" style="s2">consciousness so I&#39;m gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.690" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna talk a lot about that but to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.270" end="00:00:58.080" style="s2">pick up on what was just mentioned so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">came to this topic of measurement which</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.080" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">is very abstract and weird in fact like</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">I geek out on ancient Sumerian staffs</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">that have marks on them which were some</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">of the first measurement and I geeked</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:18.200" style="s2">out on the most ancient forms of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">know sacred architecture which were fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.200" end="00:01:25.770" style="s2">artifacts used to codify time you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">through this through structure that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.770" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">responded to the changes in the Sun etc</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.020" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">and so but I came know this from</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:33.450" style="s2">educational measurement</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:36.090" style="s2">you know I&#39;m Dyslexic and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:41.430" style="s2">consistently mismeasured or felt to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.090" end="00:01:43.440" style="s2">and I realize that measurement is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.430" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">invisible part of our day-to-day lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.440" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">in fact if you sit there and you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:51.110" style="s2">about the number of ways you understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:54.900" style="s2">yourself through the prism of a measure</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.110" end="00:01:57.870" style="s2">it is in fact hard to end the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.900" end="00:02:00.510" style="s2">enumeration of the list and many of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.870" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">these things are in fact very recent so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.510" end="00:02:07.940" style="s2">people don&#39;t realize that the use of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">number to mark our chronological age</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.940" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">it&#39;s something that did not begin on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">wide scale until after the Civil War so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:17.939" style="s2">that&#39;s less than 200 years ago it used</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:18.830" style="s2">to be you were the helvis you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.939" end="00:02:21.050" style="s2">youngest</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.830" end="00:02:24.260" style="s2">born before after this major historical</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.050" end="00:02:26.090" style="s2">marker so to the flood but the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.260" end="00:02:29.900" style="s2">and the need to know your exact</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.090" end="00:02:32.510" style="s2">numerical age let alone your precise</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.900" end="00:02:35.630" style="s2">birthday you know that&#39;s an artifact of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.510" end="00:02:37.850" style="s2">our bureaucracy age is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.630" end="00:02:41.330" style="s2">things the number we apply ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.850" end="00:02:43.790" style="s2">measure chronological time wait is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.330" end="00:02:45.950" style="s2">another one there&#39;s a very direct</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.790" end="00:02:49.250" style="s2">correlation between the availability of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.950" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">the bathroom scale the mass-produced</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.250" end="00:02:57.230" style="s2">bathroom scale after World War Two and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:58.730" style="s2">anorexia so I started to see how</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.230" end="00:03:01.990" style="s2">measures are everywhere and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.730" end="00:03:04.040" style="s2">established these feedback loops and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.990" end="00:03:05.510" style="s2">today in a nutshell I&#39;m where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:08.660" style="s2">talking about is the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.510" end="00:03:11.420" style="s2">witnessing the birth of the first-ever</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.660" end="00:03:13.250" style="s2">planetary scale measurement meta</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.420" end="00:03:14.870" style="s2">structure so it&#39;s a mouthful and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.250" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">probably one of the worst titles for an</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.870" end="00:03:19.520" style="s2">academic paper I&#39;ve ever been but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:30.320" style="s2">like a very precise kind of description</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.520" end="00:03:31.880" style="s2">of it so let me get my slides going so</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:36.980" style="s2">this issue of planetary scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.880" end="00:03:38.600" style="s2">measurement is actually quite old you</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.980" end="00:03:41.570" style="s2">know I would argue that humans had been</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.600" end="00:03:44.810" style="s2">trying to measure the entire world since</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.570" end="00:03:47.720" style="s2">we became humans you know the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.810" end="00:03:50.120" style="s2">attempt to build this thing which is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:51.260" style="s2">say to build a measurement instrument as</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.120" end="00:03:52.780" style="s2">big as the earth and to try to measure</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:55.190" style="s2">the whole earth and everything on it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.780" end="00:03:58.310" style="s2">which is what we&#39;re trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.190" end="00:04:00.950" style="s2">our increasingly omniscient and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.310" end="00:04:03.230" style="s2">artificially intelligence enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.950" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">scanners and sensor networks that just</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.230" end="00:04:08.209" style="s2">encircle the earth and uploaded all</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:11.150" style="s2">clouds we talked about Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.209" end="00:04:16.669" style="s2">Bratton&#39;s notion of the planetary scale</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.150" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">computational stack and the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.669" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">attempt at something like that was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:23.419" style="s2">Tower of Babel which you may recall was</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">a failed project and this is a picture</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.419" end="00:04:29.000" style="s2">of that it was very famous so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:30.500" style="s2">to note here which is interesting is at</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.000" end="00:04:31.050" style="s2">the bottom of this picture you see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.500" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">king</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.050" end="00:04:35.160" style="s2">and you see one of the workmen</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">addressing the Kings foot now it looks</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.160" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">like he is in a sense worshiping the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:42.930" style="s2">king what he&#39;s actually doing is getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:45.419" style="s2">the measure of the Kings foot and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.930" end="00:04:47.150" style="s2">in a very concrete way shows us the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.419" end="00:04:51.389" style="s2">relationship between measure and power</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.150" end="00:04:52.740" style="s2">even in the ancient world and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.389" end="00:04:54.210" style="s2">going to trace a little bit the arc of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.740" end="00:04:57.210" style="s2">the conscious history of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.210" end="00:05:00.860" style="s2">and the evolution of measurement and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.210" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">relationship between us and to move from</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.860" end="00:05:08.430" style="s2">anthropocentric measurement to totally</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.400" end="00:05:10.949" style="s2">abstract geocentric measurement and back</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.430" end="00:05:12.419" style="s2">again through this post-modernism so</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.949" end="00:05:14.430" style="s2">we&#39;re going to get there but we start</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.419" end="00:05:17.190" style="s2">with the Tower of Babel which is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.430" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">about this project to build a map to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.190" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">basically make the planet into a giant</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:24.900" style="s2">building and make it beautiful not</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:26.430" style="s2">enough and tall enough to you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.900" end="00:05:30.139" style="s2">either invite God down to hang out at</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.430" end="00:05:35.539" style="s2">the temple or to visit him directly and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.139" end="00:05:35.539" style="s2">so now since then it&#39;s it&#39;s been a mess</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">measurement has been a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.979" end="00:05:42.180" style="s2">measurement has been an issue of social</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:44.819" style="s2">justice since the beginning right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.180" end="00:05:48.330" style="s2">note here the archetype of justice</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.819" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">right what does she hold she was an</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.330" end="00:05:52.830" style="s2">instrument of measurement and an</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">instrument of violence this is very</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.830" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">significant and seemed that we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.289" style="s2">occurring throughout the lecture is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:04.469" style="s2">relationship between measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.289" end="00:06:06.630" style="s2">violence but also the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.469" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">between measurement and justice right</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.630" end="00:06:11.880" style="s2">which is to say that true justice of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:15.050" style="s2">archetype implies true justice is about</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.880" end="00:06:17.930" style="s2">seeing objectively and about weighing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.050" end="00:06:21.180" style="s2">appropriately in a considered judgment</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.930" end="00:06:22.380" style="s2">what is justice what is correct and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.180" end="00:06:24.210" style="s2">of course having the sovereignty and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.380" end="00:06:25.620" style="s2">power to enforce that so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.210" end="00:06:28.770" style="s2">you&#39;re getting with this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.620" end="00:06:31.690" style="s2">between measurement adjustments</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.770" end="00:06:33.910" style="s2">so back to educational measurement this</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.690" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">is a picture of Michelle Rhee she is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.910" end="00:06:40.840" style="s2">kind of infamous one-time superintendent</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.960" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">of the Washington DC schools and she</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.840" end="00:06:44.770" style="s2">represents in some ways kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:47.260" style="s2">epitome of the worst of No Child Left</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.770" end="00:06:50.470" style="s2">Behind she used standardized tests</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.260" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">suggest you&#39;ve got schools and fire</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.470" end="00:06:56.010" style="s2">teachers mercilessly I mean this picture</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:58.870" style="s2">is interesting for a number of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.010" end="00:07:00.250" style="s2">one is that it shows directly the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.870" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">relationship between measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.250" end="00:07:03.610" style="s2">violence within a single instrument</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:05.710" style="s2">right so what&#39;s she doing there she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.610" end="00:07:08.470" style="s2">mimicking the classic school marm will</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.710" end="00:07:10.990" style="s2">rap you on the knuckles with the ruler</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.470" end="00:07:14.289" style="s2">right so it&#39;s something very poignant</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.990" end="00:07:16.660" style="s2">here about the double symbolism that in</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.289" end="00:07:19.030" style="s2">this case measurement violence are</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.660" end="00:07:21.190" style="s2">literally United in the V are distinct</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.030" end="00:07:24.490" style="s2">and I would say they are so in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.190" end="00:07:26.590" style="s2">standardized test there&#39;s a coercion to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.490" end="00:07:28.660" style="s2">especially multiple-choice standardized</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.590" end="00:07:30.310" style="s2">testing that we take for granted but in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.660" end="00:07:32.950" style="s2">fact it&#39;s a blunt instrument that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.310" end="00:07:35.830" style="s2">the sharp end of a stick so one way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.950" end="00:07:39.400" style="s2">think about how measurement is violent</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.830" end="00:07:43.950" style="s2">by its nature now another thing violent</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.400" end="00:07:46.990" style="s2">is bad like surgery is violent right</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.950" end="00:07:49.450" style="s2">self-defense could be about some forms</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.990" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">of science are violent so I&#39;m not making</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.450" end="00:07:53.800" style="s2">necessarily value judgment on violence</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:07:56.110" style="s2">but what I am saying is that if we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.800" end="00:07:57.910" style="s2">going to use a measurement instrument we</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.110" end="00:08:02.789" style="s2">have to think like we&#39;re acting</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.910" end="00:08:04.599" style="s2">surgically and not like this is a free</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.789" end="00:08:06.610" style="s2">intervention this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.599" end="00:08:08.320" style="s2">measurement always does something and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.610" end="00:08:10.090" style="s2">this is we&#39;re gonna be returning to us</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.320" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">so we need to be careful what we measure</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.090" end="00:08:13.620" style="s2">but want me to think about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">violence and measurement of that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.620" end="00:08:18.310" style="s2">measure allows us to impinge upon</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.650" style="s2">organic form so I&#39;m going to use an</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.310" end="00:08:23.710" style="s2">example from architecture so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.650" end="00:08:27.160" style="s2">city from the 1300s in Europe I believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.710" end="00:08:30.990" style="s2">it&#39;s in Belgium and this city trafficked</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.160" end="00:08:34.830" style="s2">a ton of commodities and an economic hub</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.990" end="00:08:38.620" style="s2">and it looks actually remarkably like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.830" end="00:08:40.510" style="s2">cell it looks actually very organic and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.620" end="00:08:43.959" style="s2">it formed very organically</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.510" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">and in medieval times there was mass</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.959" end="00:08:48.630" style="s2">amounts of metrological pluralism within</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">Europe as a whole which is to say every</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.630" end="00:08:54.699" style="s2">Kingdom had a different king with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:56.769" style="s2">different sized foot and they use</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.699" end="00:08:58.209" style="s2">different scales etc and so in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.769" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">was a place where many measures were</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.209" end="00:09:01.149" style="s2">brought together in a centralized</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:03.880" style="s2">marketplace the point is there was no</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.149" end="00:09:08.980" style="s2">standardised magic now you look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.880" end="00:09:10.649" style="s2">Chicago in eighteen 1852 so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:13.089" style="s2">very different City</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.649" end="00:09:15.339" style="s2">the only thing organic is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.089" end="00:09:17.829" style="s2">river that&#39;s winding through it and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.339" end="00:09:19.980" style="s2">river was shaped about as much as it</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.829" end="00:09:25.779" style="s2">could be possibly by human construction</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.980" end="00:09:28.380" style="s2">and so the idea that in fact you need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.779" end="00:09:31.510" style="s2">structure it this way to run commodities</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.380" end="00:09:34.149" style="s2">you know per unit through efficiently is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.510" end="00:09:36.220" style="s2">actually wrong it&#39;s been shown at some</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.149" end="00:09:37.720" style="s2">of these old cities relatively</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.220" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">relatively in terms of population</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.720" end="00:09:41.560" style="s2">traffic in just as many commodities</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:43.660" style="s2">right so what&#39;s the logic behind</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.560" end="00:09:46.839" style="s2">structure in Chicago this way it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.660" end="00:09:49.569" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s predicated on modern</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.839" end="00:09:53.380" style="s2">surveying techniques and radically</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.569" end="00:09:56.589" style="s2">standardized measures such that you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.380" end="00:09:58.920" style="s2">the city blocks are identical therefore</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.589" end="00:10:01.329" style="s2">you can lay down this many you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.920" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">sidewalks squares per block so you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.329" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">plan whole architecture whole city</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.740" style="s2">escapes from hotel room based on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:12.519" style="s2">standardization that was taken for</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.740" end="00:10:13.779" style="s2">granted by 1852 much Brown now the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.519" end="00:10:15.490" style="s2">relationship between measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.779" end="00:10:17.319" style="s2">violence here has to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.490" end="00:10:20.680" style="s2">that the reason Chicago is structured</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.319" end="00:10:22.209" style="s2">this way and this is an argument that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.680" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">laid out in the book called seeing like</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.209" end="00:10:27.639" style="s2">a state which I recommend which is in</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:30.569" style="s2">guy&#39;s last name Scott the argument here</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.639" end="00:10:33.850" style="s2">is that structure like this actually to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.569" end="00:10:36.550" style="s2">quell any possibility of worker dissent</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.850" end="00:10:38.500" style="s2">through violent uprising in this city</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.550" end="00:10:42.699" style="s2">everyone had some legible address and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:45.639" style="s2">every corridor can be populated with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.699" end="00:10:47.709" style="s2">police force so we can find you and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.639" end="00:10:50.680" style="s2">can stop doing your buddies from getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.709" end="00:10:52.899" style="s2">out of hand this was an architectural</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.680" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">style that was pioneered after the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.899" end="00:10:56.829" style="s2">French Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:58.329" style="s2">um especially by Napoleon and it was one</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.829" end="00:10:59.769" style="s2">of the reasons that the metric system</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.329" end="00:11:02.769" style="s2">was actually spread throughout Europe</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.769" end="00:11:06.040" style="s2">the metric system which is the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.769" end="00:11:08.230" style="s2">example of the world centric measurement</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.040" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">practice but not a world centric</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.230" end="00:11:12.310" style="s2">measurement Mehta structure we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:14.380" style="s2">that but the metric system was spread on</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.310" end="00:11:16.540" style="s2">the metric system was spread around the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.380" end="00:11:18.670" style="s2">world on the end of the beta it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.540" end="00:11:20.139" style="s2">way to read it there&#39;s many it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.670" end="00:11:22.329" style="s2">complex history of measurement so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.139" end="00:11:24.910" style="s2">there&#39;s many narratives but one of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.329" end="00:11:27.399" style="s2">has to do with a standardizing military</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.910" end="00:11:32.620" style="s2">equipment and standardizing the location</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.399" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">of every person in the city as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.620" end="00:11:37.690" style="s2">mentioned at the outset your actual</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:41.170" style="s2">chronological age the whole measurement</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.690" end="00:11:43.420" style="s2">logic gets turned on the human late in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.170" end="00:11:46.269" style="s2">modernity and into post modernity but at</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.420" end="00:11:50.370" style="s2">first it&#39;s just a land and the commodity</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.269" end="00:11:54.610" style="s2">production systems but what is matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.370" end="00:11:59.140" style="s2">all right so this is Vermeer this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.610" end="00:12:00.519" style="s2">woman holding a balance so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.140" end="00:12:03.310" style="s2">interesting about this is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.519" end="00:12:06.310" style="s2">picture behind her the painting within</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.310" end="00:12:10.180" style="s2">the painting is the judgment of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.310" end="00:12:12.730" style="s2">when he comes back right and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.180" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">Christ holding his holding scale and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.730" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">sword and so there she stands in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:25.420" style="s2">shadow of that picture holding her own</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:28.029" style="s2">scale of course without a sword right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.420" end="00:12:31.209" style="s2">the issue of where is the sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.029" end="00:12:33.820" style="s2">behind this scale and it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.209" end="00:12:38.709" style="s2">burgeoning nation-state at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.820" end="00:12:40.440" style="s2">of the capitalist world system so but</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.709" end="00:12:42.670" style="s2">what measurement is is a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.440" end="00:12:44.459" style="s2">but what we&#39;re seeing here is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.670" end="00:12:47.410" style="s2">most practical uses of measurement</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.459" end="00:12:48.910" style="s2">before the advances of into science</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.410" end="00:12:50.350" style="s2">where we created measures just for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.910" end="00:12:51.850" style="s2">sake of understanding things measures</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.350" end="00:12:54.610" style="s2">were primarily created just for</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.850" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">practical usage so in this case she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.610" end="00:12:58.569" style="s2">probably engaged in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:13:01.260" style="s2">economic transaction around the weight</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.569" end="00:13:03.640" style="s2">of the gold and jewels</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.260" end="00:13:05.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a pre-modern measure so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.640" end="00:13:06.620" style="s2">give a little tour here so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.470" end="00:13:09.560" style="s2">think measurement has a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.620" end="00:13:12.740" style="s2">been one thing in fact we inherit this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.560" end="00:13:14.330" style="s2">massive legacy of measures and those of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.740" end="00:13:16.390" style="s2">us innovating and the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.330" end="00:13:19.700" style="s2">measurement technique in technology</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.390" end="00:13:22.610" style="s2">should be aware of where this came from</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.700" end="00:13:30.680" style="s2">and we can actually repeat terrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.610" end="00:13:31.820" style="s2">missed things you know so yes so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.680" end="00:13:34.790" style="s2">figure here is interesting it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.820" end="00:13:38.510" style="s2">metrological relief that they&#39;re dating</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.790" end="00:13:40.130" style="s2">here about eighth century BC and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.510" end="00:13:44.030" style="s2">would have been a common artifact on</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.130" end="00:13:47.380" style="s2">most ancient kind of construction sites</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.030" end="00:13:50.510" style="s2">and so what this is is it codifies the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.380" end="00:13:53.020" style="s2">anthropocentric dimensions of all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.510" end="00:13:55.520" style="s2">key things that need to be measured</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.020" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">right and so this is how it began it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.520" end="00:14:00.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t begin with international</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:05.830" style="s2">standards organization which I&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.620" end="00:14:08.480" style="s2">him nor with the metric system with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.830" end="00:14:10.130" style="s2">scientifically they refined length of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.480" end="00:14:11.330" style="s2">the meter by weight we know they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.130" end="00:14:13.310" style="s2">fine the link of the meter by wavelength</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.330" end="00:14:14.030" style="s2">of light that&#39;s how precisely this it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.310" end="00:14:17.300" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.030" end="00:14:19.250" style="s2">you had unity at the work site maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.300" end="00:14:22.940" style="s2">unity at the city at best in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.250" end="00:14:24.680" style="s2">metrological convention and then one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.940" end="00:14:26.120" style="s2">the things you do if you a new ruler of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.680" end="00:14:27.860" style="s2">course you step in and you change it all</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.120" end="00:14:29.750" style="s2">because that&#39;s one of the things you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.860" end="00:14:32.630" style="s2">do the relation between measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.750" end="00:14:35.050" style="s2">power is such that the rulers make the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.630" end="00:14:35.050" style="s2">rulers</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.380" end="00:14:42.310" style="s2">all right so pre-modern measure looks</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.730" end="00:14:44.650" style="s2">like that was anthropocentric and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.310" end="00:14:46.960" style="s2">so interesting about the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.650" end="00:14:48.490" style="s2">all pre-modern measures being</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.960" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">anthropocentric is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.490" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">certain sacred unity to all ancient</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:54.670" style="s2">architectural sites because they all</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:56.200" style="s2">have these similar dimensionalities</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.670" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">which have to do with the proportions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.200" end="00:15:01.300" style="s2">human body all right so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:04.270" style="s2">golden mean right and so you&#39;d find</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.300" end="00:15:05.970" style="s2">those patterns in pre-modern forms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.270" end="00:15:09.070" style="s2">architecture which are actually somehow</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.970" end="00:15:11.230" style="s2">profoundly aesthetically pleasing so as</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.070" end="00:15:13.089" style="s2">I said we go from anthropocentric to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.230" end="00:15:15.700" style="s2">totally abstract geocentric and back</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.089" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">again what I&#39;m saying is that the meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.700" end="00:15:19.180" style="s2">modern or integral way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:21.820" style="s2">measurement has to do with a return to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.180" end="00:15:24.190" style="s2">the human scale and a concern for</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.820" end="00:15:27.190" style="s2">proportionalities and ratios that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.190" end="00:15:28.540" style="s2">humane right because the measures of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.190" end="00:15:30.130" style="s2">pure abstraction allows to build</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.540" end="00:15:32.350" style="s2">landscapes that no humans actually want</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.130" end="00:15:36.370" style="s2">to live and allow us to build</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.350" end="00:15:38.890" style="s2">technologies that are you know yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.370" end="00:15:42.820" style="s2">little bit crazy because they live in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.890" end="00:15:45.730" style="s2">this realm of proportions and ratios</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.820" end="00:15:47.560" style="s2">that are fiction from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.730" end="00:15:49.029" style="s2">the human organism so but that&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.560" end="00:15:51.760" style="s2">ahead of ourselves priests of pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.029" end="00:15:53.380" style="s2">matters had a certain quality modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.760" end="00:15:55.060" style="s2">measures were very different and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.380" end="00:15:56.740" style="s2">talked about modern measurements</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.060" end="00:15:57.100" style="s2">basically beginning with the metric</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.740" end="00:15:58.630" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.100" end="00:16:01.240" style="s2">you could probably date it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.630" end="00:16:03.339" style="s2">earlier so this is actually a pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.240" end="00:16:05.800" style="s2">that was specifically built and designed</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.339" end="00:16:07.630" style="s2">by charles sanders peirce he&#39;s on my</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.800" end="00:16:08.610" style="s2">t-shirt this is good old Charles Sanders</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.630" end="00:16:10.990" style="s2">purse</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.610" end="00:16:12.400" style="s2">so probably greatest philosopher you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.990" end="00:16:14.770" style="s2">never heard of if you haven&#39;t heard of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.400" end="00:16:17.560" style="s2">them if you have and then I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.770" end="00:16:20.500" style="s2">to say more he&#39;s kind of a legend and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.560" end="00:16:23.050" style="s2">built this thing in order to see the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.500" end="00:16:24.790" style="s2">subtle fluctuations in the in the swing</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.050" end="00:16:26.860" style="s2">of the pendulum due to the gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.790" end="00:16:29.020" style="s2">field of the earth itself and this was</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.860" end="00:16:31.000" style="s2">part of the attempts around the metric</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.020" end="00:16:33.130" style="s2">system to figure out how being the earth</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.000" end="00:16:35.560" style="s2">was like literally what is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.130" end="00:16:37.000" style="s2">circumference of the earth many</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.560" end="00:16:38.650" style="s2">speculations but they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.000" end="00:16:40.779" style="s2">trying to measure the thing because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.650" end="00:16:43.570" style="s2">wanted to make the meter which we all</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.779" end="00:16:46.030" style="s2">know and love well at least you guys not</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.570" end="00:16:47.880" style="s2">in America victory belongs to right</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.030" end="00:16:49.710" style="s2">right so there you</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.880" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">but the meter was supposed to be some</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.710" end="00:16:55.290" style="s2">specific subdivision of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:58.740" style="s2">radius of their right so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.290" end="00:17:00.540" style="s2">idea we don&#39;t want some kings we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.740" end="00:17:02.640" style="s2">gonna make it one measure for all man</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.540" end="00:17:05.010" style="s2">for all time was one of the chants</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.640" end="00:17:06.750" style="s2">during the French Revolution so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.010" end="00:17:09.270" style="s2">understand to overthrow the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.750" end="00:17:11.670" style="s2">regime of medieval measurement it took</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.270" end="00:17:14.310" style="s2">the American and French Revolutions to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.670" end="00:17:17.610" style="s2">codify at the level of the state let</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.310" end="00:17:19.770" style="s2">alone inter nationally it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.610" end="00:17:21.510" style="s2">standardized reliable measures and I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.770" end="00:17:24.120" style="s2">a huge actually social justice step</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.510" end="00:17:26.579" style="s2">forward right I can go to the gas</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.120" end="00:17:29.940" style="s2">station now regardless of what I look</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.579" end="00:17:31.770" style="s2">like my car is what the gas station</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.940" end="00:17:33.930" style="s2">intended thanks to me and I know I get a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.770" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">gallon right and if you actually look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.930" end="00:17:37.620" style="s2">the gas tank like the gas pump you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.580" style="s2">see there&#39;s this little thing that says</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.620" end="00:17:42.870" style="s2">certified by the state this is a gallon</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.580" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">you know you can thank the French</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.870" end="00:17:47.550" style="s2">Revolution and the call to overthrow the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:49.470" style="s2">arbitrary Fiat of the ruler to set the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.550" end="00:17:54.210" style="s2">ruler and to Institute of so-called</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.470" end="00:17:56.520" style="s2">scientific Universal geocentric modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.210" end="00:18:00.180" style="s2">measure and so that&#39;s that&#39;s modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.520" end="00:18:02.610" style="s2">modern measures and modern measures as I</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.180" end="00:18:05.850" style="s2">said were eventually turned toward the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.610" end="00:18:08.970" style="s2">human itself and we came to not only</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.850" end="00:18:10.890" style="s2">desire to standardize the measurement of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.970" end="00:18:13.160" style="s2">land and commodity as a net cetera but</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.890" end="00:18:15.570" style="s2">to standardize the development of humans</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.160" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">and so this is a fascinating artifact</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.570" end="00:18:20.850" style="s2">from 1931 which is the standardized</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:24.060" style="s2">service worker and this of course has</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.850" end="00:18:26.130" style="s2">been exponential eyes labor practices in</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.060" end="00:18:27.870" style="s2">the place like Amazon they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.130" end="00:18:31.140" style="s2">measurement techniques on they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.870" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">path to where was framed you know with</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.140" end="00:18:34.650" style="s2">wrist bracelets actually track every</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:37.560" style="s2">movement of the Amazon worker</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.650" end="00:18:41.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s hyper measured commodified</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.560" end="00:18:44.670" style="s2">labor so so modern measures were</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.160" end="00:18:47.730" style="s2">eventually turned to the human and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.670" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">led to a variety of both advancements</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.730" end="00:18:52.800" style="s2">and node attractions so eventually we</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:54.300" style="s2">start to see beyond the pure simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.800" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">abstraction of the modern measures the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.300" end="00:18:58.830" style="s2">kind of monological view of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.330" style="s2">and we started to get postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.830" end="00:19:01.780" style="s2">measures that looked specifically at</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.330" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.780" end="00:19:08.980" style="s2">in the gaps at the dynamism at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:11.080" style="s2">changes at the things that defy linear</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.980" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">measurement and require nonlinear ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:17.290" style="s2">of thinking about how phenomena work and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:22.360" style="s2">so this is Jay foresters classic limits</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.290" end="00:19:27.070" style="s2">to growth and as you can see the you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.360" end="00:19:30.670" style="s2">know 2100 doesn&#39;t look good and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.070" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">that&#39;s you know so this is the this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.670" end="00:19:36.250" style="s2">the situation we still face this is part</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.530" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">of the the meta crisis but it took the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.250" end="00:19:40.030" style="s2">exhaustion of simple linear ways of</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.150" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">the future has to do with really taking</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.580" end="00:20:08.110" style="s2">never track linearly and we never do</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.740" end="00:20:09.910" style="s2">anything like an IQ test one measurement</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.110" end="00:20:11.050" style="s2">in a complex dynamical system you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.910" end="00:20:12.670" style="s2">you know what it is that&#39;s like going in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.050" end="00:20:14.590" style="s2">my backyard and taking one measurement</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.670" end="00:20:16.990" style="s2">and saying that that&#39;s how my backyard</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.590" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">works that&#39;s how my backward yard works</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.990" end="00:20:25.060" style="s2">on this date this summer the winter is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:27.040" style="s2">very different you have to respect it by</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.060" end="00:20:30.250" style="s2">its we have to respect what is by its</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.250" end="00:20:34.960" style="s2">very complex measurement and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.660" end="00:20:40.210" style="s2">postmodern measures begin to make that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:42.040" style="s2">turn and of course the turn towards the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.210" end="00:20:44.110" style="s2">human and the measuring of the human is</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.040" end="00:20:46.780" style="s2">also deepened in post-modernism to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.110" end="00:20:51.790" style="s2">point of insanity and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.780" end="00:20:53.260" style="s2">kind of the big warning and so notice</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.260" end="00:20:59.050" style="s2">point right that means it knows where</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.870" end="00:21:00.730" style="s2">you&#39;re going or it knows how long you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.050" end="00:21:04.740" style="s2">intend to run where it has some other</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.730" end="00:21:04.740" style="s2">relationship to your value and goals</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.890" end="00:21:12.779" style="s2">and so we measure what we care about and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.990" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">we care about what we measure those two</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.779" end="00:21:16.110" style="s2">things aren&#39;t necessarily the same which</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">means that you could be handed a measure</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.110" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">and start caring about something you</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:23.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t care about for just because</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:24.570" style="s2">you&#39;re measuring it now right like for</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.070" end="00:21:25.860" style="s2">example high schoolers would never care</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.570" end="00:21:27.809" style="s2">about their so-called scholastic</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.860" end="00:21:29.909" style="s2">aptitude but then for about six months</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.809" end="00:21:32.190" style="s2">also they really worried about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.909" end="00:21:35.640" style="s2">amount of spastic aptitude that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.190" end="00:21:39.269" style="s2">have and so similar we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.640" end="00:21:41.490" style="s2">postmodern metrological marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.269" end="00:21:43.799" style="s2">where there&#39;s just this rapid</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.490" end="00:21:46.409" style="s2">proliferation of measures directed at us</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.799" end="00:21:48.929" style="s2">and many of them are about things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.409" end="00:21:50.279" style="s2">we never even heard of before and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.929" end="00:21:57.080" style="s2">will the sudden there&#39;s a number and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.279" end="00:22:02.250" style="s2">care about and so this is a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.080" end="00:22:06.019" style="s2">problematic moment I&#39;ll say gently in</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.250" end="00:22:06.019" style="s2">the development of measurement and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.049" end="00:22:10.649" style="s2">I&#39;ll say that I&#39;ll pause there and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.549" end="00:22:11.909" style="s2">continue so what do measures do so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.649" end="00:22:13.289" style="s2">would want to do was I tried to give you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.909" end="00:22:17.880" style="s2">let me back slide so they&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.289" end="00:22:20.039" style="s2">reading that so when I tried to show you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.880" end="00:22:22.679" style="s2">was that measures have evolved over time</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.039" end="00:22:23.630" style="s2">right some things that were local an</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.679" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">anthropocentric</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.630" end="00:22:32.730" style="s2">to things that are now really not and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:36.450" style="s2">we&#39;re really not at the scale of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.730" end="00:22:40.169" style="s2">human and that&#39;s that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.450" end="00:22:42.090" style="s2">so but all that whole stretch of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.169" end="00:22:44.070" style="s2">all those things were doing roughly this</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.090" end="00:22:47.789" style="s2">they were all measures they were all</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.070" end="00:22:49.529" style="s2">this very different measures and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.789" end="00:22:51.240" style="s2">maybe what the measures do that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.529" end="00:22:51.960" style="s2">way to think about what is a measure it</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.240" end="00:22:53.490" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t maybe a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.960" end="00:22:54.299" style="s2">abstract to the question but we know</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.490" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">kind of what they do</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.299" end="00:22:59.639" style="s2">measures create common sense once you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:01.950" style="s2">Institute a measure that&#39;s the new way</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.639" end="00:23:05.700" style="s2">everyone relates the thing it&#39;s a shared</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.950" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">common sense about reality so but</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.700" end="00:23:09.809" style="s2">they&#39;re also creations of common sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:11.820" style="s2">and this is a longer discussion in</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.809" end="00:23:14.309" style="s2">theoretical metrology about where the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.820" end="00:23:15.389" style="s2">measures come from it&#39;s complicated by</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.309" end="00:23:18.390" style="s2">the end of the day they come from a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.389" end="00:23:22.650" style="s2">refinement are pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.390" end="00:23:24.600" style="s2">or intuitions so measures also serve as</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.650" end="00:23:27.420" style="s2">shared presuppositions of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.600" end="00:23:28.910" style="s2">and competition so they help us to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.420" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">along but they also help us to compete</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.910" end="00:23:35.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s important in general they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:39.060" style="s2">part of what&#39;s on the table between us</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.240" end="00:23:41.580" style="s2">right so you think about the third party</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.060" end="00:23:45.420" style="s2">president at all human interaction</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.580" end="00:23:47.880" style="s2">you know the symbol or the tool or the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.420" end="00:23:50.520" style="s2">language so a measure has that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.880" end="00:23:51.660" style="s2">fundamental nature it&#39;s really been part</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.520" end="00:23:54.680" style="s2">of what humans been up to for a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.660" end="00:23:58.010" style="s2">long time it&#39;s collaborating around</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.680" end="00:24:00.090" style="s2">measures and creating new measures</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.010" end="00:24:01.560" style="s2">that&#39;s because they mediate between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.090" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">mind and reality they&#39;re part of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.560" end="00:24:05.970" style="s2">keeps us in touch with reality right</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:09.020" style="s2">then the very first I believe in William</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.970" end="00:24:10.920" style="s2">Irwin Thompson recorded this their first</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.020" end="00:24:13.860" style="s2">measurement ever discovered</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.920" end="00:24:17.310" style="s2">archaeologically it&#39;s ridiculously old</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.860" end="00:24:18.330" style="s2">like ancient Babylonia three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.310" end="00:24:21.420" style="s2">thousand years or something before</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.330" end="00:24:24.900" style="s2">Christ and it was as far as we can tell</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.420" end="00:24:27.090" style="s2">a stick used by a medicine woman to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.900" end="00:24:29.670" style="s2">track basically the moon and her</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.090" end="00:24:33.270" style="s2">menstrual cycle it&#39;s just a simple notch</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.670" end="00:24:34.620" style="s2">on a stick but what it did was and for</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.270" end="00:24:36.600" style="s2">many the first ones were about time</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.620" end="00:24:37.710" style="s2">which is in order to to measure it</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.600" end="00:24:39.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s very times actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.710" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">abstract by its nature and humans relate</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.480" end="00:24:43.770" style="s2">to time in a way animals don&#39;t and so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:45.480" style="s2">needed to start keeping track of time</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.770" end="00:24:47.610" style="s2">when we started codifying it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.480" end="00:24:50.790" style="s2">mediating our relationship between our</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.610" end="00:24:54.660" style="s2">mind and abstract objective flow of time</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.790" end="00:24:57.480" style="s2">with this physical thing we knotch so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.660" end="00:25:00.060" style="s2">it&#39;s very primordial about the interest</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.480" end="00:25:01.500" style="s2">objective relationship to reality and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.060" end="00:25:03.540" style="s2">I&#39;m getting I&#39;m just going off because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.500" end="00:25:05.250" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked about this tomorrow so it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.540" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">makes complexity legible but it can also</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.250" end="00:25:12.600" style="s2">simplify complexity in a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:16.500" style="s2">society it&#39;ll it measures legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.600" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">knowledge so even if you&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.500" end="00:25:19.650" style="s2">measuring something but you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:22.680" style="s2">produce numbers that look like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.650" end="00:25:24.270" style="s2">measuring something you have helped your</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.680" end="00:25:27.210" style="s2">own caused by legitimating knowledge or</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.270" end="00:25:29.870" style="s2">appearing to pretenses of objective</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.210" end="00:25:31.540" style="s2">around measurement are very important</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.870" end="00:25:35.750" style="s2">and that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.540" end="00:25:38.360" style="s2">simplifying complexity so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.750" end="00:25:39.710" style="s2">facilitate trust which is hugely</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.360" end="00:25:43.010" style="s2">important that&#39;s the reason that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.710" end="00:25:44.840" style="s2">so powerful are particularly in the</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.840" end="00:25:50.570" style="s2">justice is that and in the Bible God</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:52.610" style="s2">says please make measures that you all</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.570" end="00:25:53.960" style="s2">trust don&#39;t scan one another with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.610" end="00:25:56.780" style="s2">measures guys because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.960" end="00:25:59.300" style="s2">important and so this idea that it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.360" end="00:26:13.460" style="s2">and then of course they encode power and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.520" end="00:26:14.810" style="s2">this is where it gets really dicey and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.460" end="00:26:16.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot to say I might which</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.830" end="00:27:45.929" style="s2">and in fact codify interpretation</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.750" end="00:27:55.080" style="s2">was weirdly worded I&#39;m so smart I</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.580" end="00:28:01.620" style="s2">interpreted the question differently</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.080" end="00:28:03.149" style="s2">no ETS as you did poorly so by their</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.620" end="00:28:08.370" style="s2">very nature that the measures are</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.149" end="00:28:09.750" style="s2">usually held by few and effect many and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.370" end="00:28:12.600" style="s2">what that means is that you have these</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.059" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">part is key and so let&#39;s ask this bats</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.850" end="00:28:21.450" style="s2">forward to the psychometric backends</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:24.360" style="s2">tacked onto every website now for</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.409" end="00:28:33.179" style="s2">people are affected by them just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.899" end="00:28:34.889" style="s2">note when there are asymmetric</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.889" end="00:28:40.230" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s okay right if you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.039" end="00:28:41.130" style="s2">a classroom of young students and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.230" end="00:28:42.389" style="s2">have a team of teachers</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.990" end="00:29:02.940" style="s2">aren&#39;t that deeply problematic ethically</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.549" end="00:29:04.289" style="s2">and it&#39;s getting worse like daily so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.940" end="00:29:05.789" style="s2">gonna switch get here so that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.289" end="00:29:06.779" style="s2">of like overview of a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.789" end="00:29:08.730" style="s2">measurement measurement history to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.779" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">contextualize what&#39;s coming now and now</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.730" end="00:29:11.220" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:15.210" style="s2">worldcentric futures for measurement</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.220" end="00:29:17.639" style="s2">this is Bucky Fuller&#39;s Dymaxion map</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.639" end="00:29:23.580" style="s2">totally check it out so I already</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.740" end="00:29:26.070" style="s2">mentioned Benjamin Britten&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.580" end="00:29:30.750" style="s2">this planetary scale computational stack</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.070" end="00:29:32.490" style="s2">and so is this intriguing but very in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.750" end="00:29:35.340" style="s2">fact once your reader like oh of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.490" end="00:29:39.000" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening right that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.340" end="00:29:41.970" style="s2">earth is being encircled in a giant mega</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.000" end="00:29:44.909" style="s2">structure that is essentially a computer</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.970" end="00:29:46.769" style="s2">and and the most important thing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.909" end="00:29:48.419" style="s2">realize about tests is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.769" end="00:29:51.289" style="s2">accidental and he uses that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.419" end="00:29:54.950" style="s2">repeatedly accidental planetary</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.030" end="00:29:59.500" style="s2">you have to get that like I chicken rut</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:03.010" style="s2">who&#39;s at the Santa Fe Institute once</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.500" end="00:30:04.390" style="s2">said like evolutionarily speaking you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.010" end="00:30:06.550" style="s2">can understand a lot of human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.390" end="00:30:10.950" style="s2">by realizing that humans are the</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.060" end="00:30:16.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like least a viable product culture</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.310" end="00:30:20.680" style="s2">like humans are the stupidest possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.990" end="00:30:23.350" style="s2">animals culture right now we are the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.680" end="00:30:25.150" style="s2">stupidest the possible culture capable</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.350" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">of generating a planetary computational</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.150" end="00:30:30.300" style="s2">stack and therefore also the stupidest</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.300" end="00:30:34.480" style="s2">something within that stack which is a</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.480" end="00:30:38.770" style="s2">which is the measurement or description</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.790" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">of the stack through the measures within</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.770" end="00:30:44.950" style="s2">it very recursive but the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:48.400" style="s2">an accidental planetary measurement meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.950" end="00:30:55.900" style="s2">structure should give us all some</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.400" end="00:30:58.090" style="s2">concern and so that&#39;s kind of like it</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.900" end="00:30:59.170" style="s2">ended there I mean this is so you leave</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.090" end="00:31:00.250" style="s2">this whole history of measurement you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.170" end="00:31:02.020" style="s2">realize a relationship to a measurement</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.250" end="00:31:04.300" style="s2">power you realize the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.020" end="00:31:05.950" style="s2">between measurement in reality we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.300" end="00:31:08.200" style="s2">measuring community measurement justice</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.950" end="00:31:13.680" style="s2">and then you realize for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.200" end="00:31:16.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve locked in accidentally a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.680" end="00:31:20.280" style="s2">measurement member structure that as we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.870" end="00:31:23.650" style="s2">saw with Apple watch goes right to your</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.280" end="00:31:26.700" style="s2">skin and they&#39;re making pills that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.650" end="00:31:29.740" style="s2">can swallow pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.700" end="00:31:31.660" style="s2">that have a microchip in them that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.740" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re taking your meds but</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.660" end="00:31:36.250" style="s2">what they do is they link the planetary</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:39.970" style="s2">computational meta structure directly</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.250" end="00:31:42.400" style="s2">into your stomach and so and this is all</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.970" end="00:31:45.850" style="s2">unfolding historically in a time period</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.400" end="00:31:48.990" style="s2">when less than 200 years ago we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.850" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">know our own ages by numerical</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.990" end="00:31:56.440" style="s2">quantification so we&#39;ve gone from a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:32:00.120" style="s2">relatively unmeasured species to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.440" end="00:32:03.930" style="s2">erratically or hyper measured species</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.120" end="00:32:05.520" style="s2">extremely rapidly so that means that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.930" end="00:32:09.630" style="s2">need to sit back and think very</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.520" end="00:32:12.390" style="s2">seriously about measurements again in</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.630" end="00:32:18.930" style="s2">the ancient world we thought a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.390" end="00:32:21.240" style="s2">measuring Aristotle is politics he</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.930" end="00:32:22.200" style="s2">collected he claims all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.240" end="00:32:25.260" style="s2">Constitution&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.200" end="00:32:26.970" style="s2">from all over the ancient world of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.260" end="00:32:29.130" style="s2">course lost with the library of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.970" end="00:32:31.470" style="s2">Alexander burning down but Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.130" end="00:32:33.330" style="s2">claims that no and we look into what he</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.470" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">writes about summarizing these and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.330" end="00:32:37.350" style="s2">realize that right front and center in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:39.450" style="s2">the Constitution&#39;s of the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.350" end="00:32:42.900" style="s2">were meta theoretical concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.450" end="00:32:46.410" style="s2">management right who gets to decide how</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.900" end="00:32:51.990" style="s2">much is a sack corn right the Miller or</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.410" end="00:32:54.660" style="s2">the farmer etc and so we&#39;ve been running</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.990" end="00:32:57.930" style="s2">on the success of the metric system as</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.660" end="00:33:01.860" style="s2">if everything we measure turned to gold</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.930" end="00:33:03.780" style="s2">and ought to be measured in fact right</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:06.030" style="s2">now we need to pause and think very</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.780" end="00:33:07.520" style="s2">deeply about a whole domain of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.030" end="00:33:11.310" style="s2">that we should maybe never measure</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.520" end="00:33:13.430" style="s2">that&#39;s one of my claims that in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.310" end="00:33:16.680" style="s2">meta modern approach to measurement</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.430" end="00:33:20.870" style="s2">respects the immeasurable and partitions</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.680" end="00:33:23.010" style="s2">off regions that are not to be measured</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.870" end="00:33:26.670" style="s2">now and that comes from understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.010" end="00:33:27.690" style="s2">what it means to measure something so</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.670" end="00:33:29.340" style="s2">this gets into the meta theory of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.690" end="00:33:31.710" style="s2">measurement and so I&#39;m thrilled that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.340" end="00:33:33.570" style="s2">guys have already had an introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.710" end="00:33:35.970" style="s2">Wilbur to a certain extent and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.570" end="00:33:38.760" style="s2">integral metatheory that he created with</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.970" end="00:33:42.210" style="s2">these quadrants which in fact retrofit a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.760" end="00:33:45.720" style="s2">perennial set of deep men of theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.210" end="00:33:49.230" style="s2">distinctions and so when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.720" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">measurement any measurement instance can</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.230" end="00:33:55.730" style="s2">be an ought to be thought of in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:58.500" style="s2">these quadrants this is a simple way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.730" end="00:34:00.510" style="s2">do a thought experiment about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.500" end="00:34:02.550" style="s2">really unfolding as a measure is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.510" end="00:34:06.120" style="s2">instituted what what&#39;s really happening</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.550" end="00:34:07.860" style="s2">here all measures actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.120" end="00:34:11.190" style="s2">subjective meaning attached to them</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.860" end="00:34:13.409" style="s2">right so from one perspective the SAT</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.190" end="00:34:16.559" style="s2">score is just in a projective index</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.409" end="00:34:19.609" style="s2">of your scholastic aptitude but of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.559" end="00:34:23.490" style="s2">course on the interior of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.609" end="00:34:25.589" style="s2">it is has a whole ton of significance</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.490" end="00:34:29.149" style="s2">about their future and there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.589" end="00:34:29.149" style="s2">self-esteem and all these other things</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.809" end="00:34:34.169" style="s2">so any measurement instance can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.490" end="00:34:38.369" style="s2">analyzed from a perspective of is it</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.169" end="00:34:41.099" style="s2">ethical or just right you can also think</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.369" end="00:34:43.349" style="s2">about the objectivity and the efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.099" end="00:34:45.269" style="s2">enabled by the measure so if you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.349" end="00:34:46.470" style="s2">about this most of what we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.269" end="00:34:48.389" style="s2">when we talk about measurement is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.470" end="00:34:51.450" style="s2">right hand quadrant stuff we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.389" end="00:34:56.369" style="s2">is the measure objective and does the</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.039" end="00:35:41.549" style="s2">you start to realize oh we should not</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.660" end="00:35:43.230" style="s2">measure some stuff and so when you hear</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.549" end="00:35:46.589" style="s2">people speak especially about the</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.690" end="00:36:48.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like a fallen angel the nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:51.420" style="s2">sense so if the Archangel Metatron were</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.570" end="00:36:53.450" style="s2">to run the way of Lucifer you would end</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.420" end="00:36:55.650" style="s2">up with an entirely omniscient</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.840" end="00:37:13.740" style="s2">his job is to dictate everything</p>

<p begin="00:37:15.900" end="00:37:20.550" style="s2">small and so it&#39;s heavy job measurement</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.630" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">intensive practice we developed</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.550" end="00:37:27.270" style="s2">measuring all of the material world but</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:30.030" style="s2">of course that&#39;s an archetype and an</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.270" end="00:37:31.950" style="s2">ideal and to imagine bringing that into</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.030" end="00:37:34.310" style="s2">physical reality and making a truly</p>

<p begin="00:37:34.310" end="00:37:39.510" style="s2">that&#39;s an example of something humans</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:41.070" style="s2">get chained to rocks and then these</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.510" end="00:37:43.170" style="s2">birds eat out their livers</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.070" end="00:37:45.450" style="s2">you know the idea that you shouldn&#39;t fly</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.170" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">too close to the Sun and etc so this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.450" end="00:37:50.670" style="s2">humors there&#39;s also irrational doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:52.410" style="s2">hold together logically it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.670" end="00:37:56.460" style="s2">to take apart the idea and realize that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.410" end="00:37:58.980" style="s2">it is possible so for example would it</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.460" end="00:38:02.010" style="s2">map itself would an omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.980" end="00:38:03.690" style="s2">measurement meta structure map its own</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.010" end="00:38:05.340" style="s2">turn own it would have to map its own</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.340" end="00:38:10.410" style="s2">regulation purposes so there are logical</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.890" end="00:38:12.330" style="s2">flaws within the very ideal itself which</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.410" end="00:38:14.850" style="s2">is another thing that ideals have they</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.330" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">are often paradoxical so then the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.850" end="00:38:19.500" style="s2">question becomes how do we you know in</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:22.380" style="s2">an appropriate way limit the omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.500" end="00:38:23.850" style="s2">was the principled way to rein in what</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.380" end="00:38:25.860" style="s2">we could do because I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.850" end="00:38:28.200" style="s2">impossible no but I&#39;m asking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.860" end="00:38:30.330" style="s2">impossible I&#39;m saying we shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.200" end="00:38:31.470" style="s2">it&#39;s very different there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.330" end="00:38:32.070" style="s2">things in artificial intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.470" end="00:38:34.350" style="s2">are that way too</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.070" end="00:38:35.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they are impossible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.350" end="00:38:38.130" style="s2">that they shouldn&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.910" end="00:38:40.319" style="s2">and this is not a way that we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.130" end="00:38:42.839" style="s2">thinking but it&#39;s a way that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.319" end="00:38:45.299" style="s2">start to think because of the power that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.839" end="00:38:48.150" style="s2">we have now and the accidental</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.299" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">measurement Mehta structure is like an</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.150" end="00:38:56.849" style="s2">atomic bomb in our hands in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:39:00.029" style="s2">devastation that it could yield and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.849" end="00:39:02.910" style="s2">so that&#39;s you know me to think so how do</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.029" end="00:39:06.089" style="s2">we limit it could measure everything we</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.910" end="00:39:08.339" style="s2">could make your life every gesture every</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.089" end="00:39:11.640" style="s2">speech act it could be measured and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.339" end="00:39:14.579" style="s2">logged in the cloud so what do we not</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.640" end="00:39:16.829" style="s2">measure so another reminder you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.579" end="00:39:22.109" style="s2">that the Internet of Things is also if</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.829" end="00:39:25.799" style="s2">not primarily an Internet of people and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.109" end="00:39:27.299" style="s2">so most of the sensor networks and even</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.799" end="00:39:29.250" style="s2">most of the things that tracks truly</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.299" end="00:39:31.049" style="s2">physical properties that don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.250" end="00:39:32.539" style="s2">semantic analysis or anything most of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.049" end="00:39:36.150" style="s2">those things are used to track human</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.539" end="00:39:38.579" style="s2">behavior or human desire you can tell a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.150" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">lot about some of them by the physical</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.579" end="00:39:44.730" style="s2">things that are mailed to their house so</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:48.500" style="s2">here&#39;s the idea integral measurement</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.730" end="00:39:51.900" style="s2">praxis and this slide contains a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.500" end="00:39:54.539" style="s2">it&#39;s essentially unchanged from my 2015</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.900" end="00:39:58.740" style="s2">side and summarizes what&#39;s in the paper</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.539" end="00:40:00.089" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out in the book and so one</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.740" end="00:40:01.710" style="s2">of the things that characterizes this</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.089" end="00:40:04.799" style="s2">kind of measurement practice which also</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.710" end="00:40:07.579" style="s2">characterizes meta modern and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.799" end="00:40:10.200" style="s2">it&#39;s meta modern is because it takes</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.579" end="00:40:11.009" style="s2">both modern and postmodern moves very</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.200" end="00:40:12.630" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.009" end="00:40:14.700" style="s2">we&#39;re not dismissing them and saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.630" end="00:40:16.500" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to the ancient ways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.700" end="00:40:18.440" style="s2">impossible first of all that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.500" end="00:40:20.579" style="s2">something that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.440" end="00:40:23.789" style="s2">because time travel is impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.579" end="00:40:27.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also just not the right way to even</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.789" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">hold yourself in your in your being you</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.720" end="00:40:32.819" style="s2">need to think about a future that has</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:34.740" style="s2">the best of what modernity did and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.819" end="00:40:36.299" style="s2">remember the metric system overthrew the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.740" end="00:40:38.549" style="s2">ancient regime which was exploiting</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.299" end="00:40:41.549" style="s2">people through the arbitrary Fiat of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.549" end="00:40:42.869" style="s2">each ruler just set the ruler right that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.549" end="00:40:45.359" style="s2">was overthrown now everyone gets the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.869" end="00:40:46.950" style="s2">same all right that&#39;s a huge move</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.359" end="00:40:48.280" style="s2">forward so we can&#39;t and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.950" end="00:40:51.460" style="s2">post-modernism can</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.280" end="00:40:54.370" style="s2">that step forward they can forget what</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.460" end="00:40:57.910" style="s2">was boone about universalism when it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.370" end="00:41:00.910" style="s2">overthrowing medievalism but then of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.910" end="00:41:02.520" style="s2">course it petrified and expanded beyond</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.910" end="00:41:07.390" style="s2">human proportions</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.520" end="00:41:10.570" style="s2">and so post-modernism reminds us about</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.390" end="00:41:12.280" style="s2">the limits of abstract measurement but</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.570" end="00:41:13.720" style="s2">post-modernism has proliferated the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.280" end="00:41:16.210" style="s2">measurement of the human and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.720" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">diced us up into a thousand fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.210" end="00:41:20.620" style="s2">sub personalities and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:23.530" style="s2">commodified kind of market demographics</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.620" end="00:41:25.900" style="s2">which were fed you know through our</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.530" end="00:41:29.050" style="s2">screens and so I&#39;m proposing that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.900" end="00:41:30.700" style="s2">actually instead of thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.050" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">we are measuring which is what we know</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.700" end="00:41:35.380" style="s2">how to do that those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:36.940" style="s2">concerned with measurement and creative</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.380" end="00:41:39.370" style="s2">creation of new measures need to think</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.940" end="00:41:41.410" style="s2">about the non ecology of absence this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.370" end="00:41:43.840" style="s2">the work of Roy best artists we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.410" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">go for this result of thing about</p>

<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:51.490" style="s2">measure something you have to think</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.290" end="00:41:53.650" style="s2">about what you left out so respect not</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.650" end="00:41:59.260" style="s2">but respect even when you&#39;re measuring</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:01.750" style="s2">what you haven&#39;t measured by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.260" end="00:42:03.160" style="s2">measuring it that&#39;s important when I</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.750" end="00:42:05.350" style="s2">measure the length of a table haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.160" end="00:42:08.590" style="s2">waited so let me know it I&#39;ve measured</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.350" end="00:42:11.020" style="s2">the length not the way when I measure</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.590" end="00:42:13.990" style="s2">the IQ of someone I haven&#39;t measured a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.020" end="00:42:14.950" style="s2">lot of other stuff to say that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.990" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">measured this but I haven&#39;t measured</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.950" end="00:42:21.910" style="s2">boom boom boom window linger on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:24.700" style="s2">absences right that actually frame the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.910" end="00:42:28.420" style="s2">presence of your finding when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.700" end="00:42:30.310" style="s2">measure okay you don&#39;t see it unless</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.420" end="00:42:31.290" style="s2">you&#39;re ignoring something else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.310" end="00:42:33.490" style="s2">actually our measurement works</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.290" end="00:42:36.780" style="s2">measurement simplifies complexity by</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.490" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2">showing you this at the expense of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.780" end="00:42:43.300" style="s2">so so the men about our move is to say I</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.280" end="00:42:46.150" style="s2">see this but I&#39;m aware of that right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.300" end="00:42:46.900" style="s2">that is especially when you&#39;re treating</p>

<p begin="00:42:46.900" end="00:42:52.570" style="s2">it&#39;s just respectful that&#39;s why as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.080" end="00:42:54.580" style="s2">dyslexic I appreciated the special</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.570" end="00:42:56.380" style="s2">educators who said oh yeah the SAT</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.580" end="00:42:57.790" style="s2">measures this but it doesn&#39;t measure</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.380" end="00:43:00.610" style="s2">these and other things that you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.790" end="00:43:01.329" style="s2">which is true and it doesn&#39;t mean yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.610" end="00:43:03.279" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.329" end="00:43:07.390" style="s2">who proved the SAT which you can which</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.279" end="00:43:09.880" style="s2">I&#39;d love to do you don&#39;t have to you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.390" end="00:43:12.099" style="s2">just say yeah it&#39;s true but partial and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.880" end="00:43:16.599" style="s2">every single measure is true but partial</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.099" end="00:43:17.950" style="s2">you have to think that way and so as I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.599" end="00:43:19.890" style="s2">said you need to respect the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.950" end="00:43:22.509" style="s2">immeasurable presents the unmeasured</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.890" end="00:43:24.339" style="s2">allow for uniqueness and uniqueness is</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.509" end="00:43:28.150" style="s2">actually very technical from a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.339" end="00:43:30.819" style="s2">metrological perspective and uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.150" end="00:43:34.359" style="s2">is an undeniable ontological facet of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.819" end="00:43:36.299" style="s2">every entity and therefore if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.359" end="00:43:38.410" style="s2">find uniqueness with your measure then</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.299" end="00:43:41.380" style="s2">the whole purpose of your measures to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.410" end="00:43:44.559" style="s2">destroy uniqueness most measures in</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.380" end="00:43:47.829" style="s2">pinja pond or specifically or designed</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.559" end="00:43:50.410" style="s2">to give the uniqueness out and focus on</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.829" end="00:43:52.719" style="s2">what everything hasn&#39;t common but if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.410" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">throw enough measures at something over</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.719" end="00:43:59.109" style="s2">a long enough time scale you can find</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:02.680" style="s2">they unique even in the universal that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.109" end="00:44:04.239" style="s2">what dynamic systems modeling does so</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.680" end="00:44:05.589" style="s2">everything has a temperature but not</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.239" end="00:44:08.469" style="s2">everything has this temperature</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.589" end="00:44:11.140" style="s2">signature which is a temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.469" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">unfolding fluctuation of temperatures</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.140" end="00:44:16.630" style="s2">which can only be measured over multiple</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:18.549" style="s2">measurements is over time right so</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.630" end="00:44:22.809" style="s2">that&#39;s a way to use the universal to</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.549" end="00:44:26.650" style="s2">detect the unique and not use the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.809" end="00:44:29.049" style="s2">universal to detect one of three right</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.650" end="00:44:32.289" style="s2">not use the universal to detect one and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.049" end="00:44:36.459" style="s2">seven use the universal to detect the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.289" end="00:44:38.890" style="s2">unique very different and actually a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.459" end="00:44:40.690" style="s2">huge challenge even for the most gifted</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.890" end="00:44:42.690" style="s2">educators and basically at this point</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.690" end="00:44:45.609" style="s2">impossible from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.690" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">design technologically so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.609" end="00:44:50.259" style="s2">conversation so I&#39;ve talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.160" end="00:44:55.539" style="s2">dynamical systems but but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.259" end="00:44:59.240" style="s2">think of the planetary stack as resting</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.539" end="00:45:01.400" style="s2">on a cloud not on a rock</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.240" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">the reality of human culture is</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.400" end="00:45:06.890" style="s2">consistently changing the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">each mind is so much flux and dynamism</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.890" end="00:45:14.869" style="s2">that if we imagine the stack resting on</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:19.460" style="s2">some piece of like manipulable rock or</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.869" end="00:45:20.660" style="s2">clay or blank slate we&#39;re gonna do some</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.460" end="00:45:22.820" style="s2">damage because we&#39;re going to force</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.660" end="00:45:26.089" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna force things into that mold</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.820" end="00:45:29.630" style="s2">so we need to assume as much dynamism as</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.089" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">there could possibly be and then working</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.630" end="00:45:34.070" style="s2">to kind more so that&#39;s about again</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:37.010" style="s2">privileged in the dynamical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.070" end="00:45:39.500" style="s2">first then going to the linear it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.010" end="00:45:41.510" style="s2">necessary not starting with the linear</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.500" end="00:45:42.980" style="s2">and then going to the dynamical when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.510" end="00:45:45.890" style="s2">realize that the linear model doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.980" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">apply you see so it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.890" end="00:45:49.400" style="s2">making good on the paradigm change to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:51.380" style="s2">the dynamical systems modeling that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.400" end="00:45:55.640" style="s2">you know prophesized in the seventies</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.380" end="00:45:58.580" style="s2">and then finally the interiors and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.640" end="00:46:01.220" style="s2">ethics and aesthetics as part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.580" end="00:46:04.099" style="s2">measurement conversation to expand what</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.220" end="00:46:07.849" style="s2">it means to be an expert in discourse</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.099" end="00:46:10.490" style="s2">was about measurement and so right now</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.849" end="00:46:13.550" style="s2">again remember a symmetries of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.490" end="00:46:15.260" style="s2">informational environments and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.550" end="00:46:18.250" style="s2">rulers make the ruler so right now most</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.260" end="00:46:21.320" style="s2">of the conversations about the future of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.250" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">the planetary measurement meta structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.320" end="00:46:27.550" style="s2">are happening in backrooms among experts</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:31.369" style="s2">and not necessarily because they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.550" end="00:46:34.010" style="s2">like a conspiratorial because precisely</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.369" end="00:46:35.240" style="s2">because they&#39;re experts that no one</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.010" end="00:46:37.010" style="s2">actually nope it was started to be about</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.240" end="00:46:40.119" style="s2">in those times so with the so the when</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.010" end="00:46:42.980" style="s2">you do is open these conversations to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.119" end="00:46:45.619" style="s2">realize their human significance and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.980" end="00:46:49.010" style="s2">again start thinking about the ratios</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.619" end="00:46:51.950" style="s2">and the scales and the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.010" end="00:46:54.740" style="s2">between utility and efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.950" end="00:47:00.020" style="s2">meaning and ethics that&#39;s where the main</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.740" end="00:47:03.339" style="s2">tension is the primary driver of modern</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.020" end="00:47:08.270" style="s2">and in many ways the postmodern is</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.339" end="00:47:09.950" style="s2">efficiency over ethics notice oh we need</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.270" end="00:47:11.480" style="s2">to reverse that which means we actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.950" end="00:47:13.130" style="s2">need to worry about what&#39;s unique and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.480" end="00:47:16.520" style="s2">what&#39;s inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.130" end="00:47:20.990" style="s2">god forbid and non unsustainable or</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.520" end="00:47:23.810" style="s2">stupid but not reductionistic Li and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.990" end="00:47:25.340" style="s2">mechanistically efficient which is what</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.810" end="00:47:32.180" style="s2">we&#39;d like to see the educational system</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.340" end="00:47:35.480" style="s2">be for example so that&#39;s the talk I kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.180" end="00:47:36.830" style="s2">of really kind of went for it and like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.480" end="00:47:37.550" style="s2">said I haven&#39;t been talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.830" end="00:47:38.690" style="s2">much lately</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.550" end="00:47:43.070" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t know exactly what I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.690" end="00:47:45.020" style="s2">gonna say and you know I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.070" end="00:47:47.810" style="s2">probably raised more questions for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.020" end="00:47:50.660" style="s2">guys then I have and this was extremely</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.810" end="00:47:52.670" style="s2">provisional and in fact while I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.660" end="00:47:55.010" style="s2">regret saying anything in particular I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.670" end="00:47:56.840" style="s2">do have a vague sense that I didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.010" end="00:48:00.260" style="s2">a bunch of important stuff that I should</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.840" end="00:48:01.580" style="s2">have said no I&#39;m hoping that you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.260" end="00:48:56.440" style="s2">some questions and that we&#39;ll find that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.580" end="00:49:00.500" style="s2">stuff I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.440" end="00:49:02.360" style="s2">type of measure that I think needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.500" end="00:49:05.270" style="s2">talked about so I&#39;m really glad you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.360" end="00:49:07.730" style="s2">raised that and so sure you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.270" end="00:49:10.130" style="s2">aware that there&#39;s a huge burgeoning</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.730" end="00:49:13.330" style="s2">academic field around measuring things</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.130" end="00:49:16.490" style="s2">like happiness wellness these things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.330" end="00:49:18.440" style="s2">so what I&#39;m gonna do is talk about how I</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.490" end="00:49:22.130" style="s2">would approach evaluating those measures</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.440" end="00:49:23.570" style="s2">of thinking about those measures as far</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.130" end="00:49:25.120" style="s2">as whether it should be measured or not</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.570" end="00:49:27.970" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.120" end="00:49:30.700" style="s2">since that train has left the station</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.970" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">right like I don&#39;t think we kind of shut</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.700" end="00:49:36.500" style="s2">that industry down as it were and let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.500" end="00:49:39.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we&#39;re because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.030" end="00:49:41.360" style="s2">no one face value like we should be</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.500" end="00:49:43.820" style="s2">thinking about least for research</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.360" end="00:49:47.650" style="s2">purposes so here&#39;s some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.820" end="00:49:51.290" style="s2">that&#39;s on my mind fed right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:53.090" style="s2">definitionally well-being is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.290" end="00:50:00.080" style="s2">philosophical problem sorry for my</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.090" end="00:50:02.540" style="s2">french so that&#39;s the first right are we</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.080" end="00:50:05.690" style="s2">taking seriously the complexity of what</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.540" end="00:50:08.750" style="s2">it means to have well be the provisional</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.690" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">studies in happiness show at people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.750" end="00:50:13.370" style="s2">often on the short-term are unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:18.710" style="s2">that&#39;s for example like two young</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.370" end="00:50:20.210" style="s2">children lives are if you were like how</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.710" end="00:50:23.810" style="s2">you feeling about how tired oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.210" end="00:50:25.700" style="s2">my god and like over the long run they</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.810" end="00:50:29.540" style="s2">express these deeper more profound</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.700" end="00:50:32.210" style="s2">senses right which people who are happy</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.540" end="00:50:34.010" style="s2">day to day often have these lingering</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.210" end="00:50:38.360" style="s2">existential kind of doubts about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.010" end="00:50:40.310" style="s2">future significance that&#39;s not about is</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.360" end="00:50:42.560" style="s2">one happy you&#39;re not happy that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.310" end="00:50:45.620" style="s2">about how complex the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.560" end="00:50:47.600" style="s2">happiness and well-being is at least as</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.620" end="00:50:49.400" style="s2">complex and so what we need to do is be</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.600" end="00:50:52.180" style="s2">very careful warmer thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.400" end="00:50:56.780" style="s2">to be sure that we are not codify some</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.180" end="00:50:58.850" style="s2">superficial definition right that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.780" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">of like it&#39;s socially acceptable and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.850" end="00:51:05.710" style="s2">useful for people to be exploited that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:08.030" style="s2">that&#39;s my sense like there was a town in</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.710" end="00:51:11.340" style="s2">Louisiana that was declared to be the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.030" end="00:51:13.110" style="s2">happiest town in America</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.340" end="00:51:15.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just because they have grades all</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.110" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">day and it was full of basically very</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.480" end="00:51:21.780" style="s2">conservative Christians so yes happiest</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">town America right this is it about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.780" end="00:51:26.490" style="s2">definitional first steps that means</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:31.020" style="s2">who&#39;s behind the research and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.490" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">funding matter who&#39;s measuring who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.020" end="00:51:37.980" style="s2">deciding go ask the healthcare companies</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:41.910" style="s2">who&#39;s deciding what well-being is they</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.980" end="00:51:43.170" style="s2">decide that&#39;s good for you that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.910" end="00:51:44.820" style="s2">when you look at the fringes of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.170" end="00:51:45.650" style="s2">acceptable in medicine you start to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.820" end="00:51:47.490" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.650" end="00:51:50.430" style="s2">actually they&#39;re details in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.490" end="00:51:53.030" style="s2">question in general you can see them a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.430" end="00:52:01.550" style="s2">little bit skeptical of the current work</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.030" end="00:52:06.420" style="s2">because most but I&#39;m also thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.550" end="00:52:11.150" style="s2">that we live in a time when certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.420" end="00:52:11.150" style="s2">definitions of well-being could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.360" end="00:52:16.670" style="s2">what&#39;s actually taking place so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.250" end="00:52:22.500" style="s2">mostly I see these conversations no</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.670" end="00:52:25.170" style="s2">which is to say I want to get too</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.500" end="00:52:29.490" style="s2">radical but my sense is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.170" end="00:52:30.780" style="s2">certain historical moments in which well</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.490" end="00:52:35.430" style="s2">you&#39;re not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.780" end="00:52:37.410" style="s2">in one sense right and so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.430" end="00:52:40.350" style="s2">throwing measures of happiness at a</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.410" end="00:52:41.700" style="s2">population and demonstrating back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.350" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">them oh your goods are actually happy</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.700" end="00:52:45.480" style="s2">they may not feel like it but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:46.950" style="s2">actually out on the whole you&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.480" end="00:52:47.970" style="s2">they&#39;re just like all these people</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.950" end="00:52:51.260" style="s2">you&#39;re not sitting they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.970" end="00:52:54.870" style="s2">happy we prove that this is Galen</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.260" end="00:52:57.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a very weird and nefarious that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.870" end="00:53:00.300" style="s2">right and again you know mmm</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.660" end="00:53:02.100" style="s2">like what are you doing with the measure</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.300" end="00:53:03.750" style="s2">are you trying to get a press release</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.100" end="00:53:04.860" style="s2">like and that&#39;s again who&#39;s measuring</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.750" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">who for what purpose</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.860" end="00:53:08.670" style="s2">where&#39;s this being codified into a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">technology that&#39;s giving them feedback</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.670" end="00:53:14.310" style="s2">to improve their so that&#39;s a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:19.550" style="s2">measurement things are done so write</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.310" end="00:53:22.650" style="s2">papers to argue how healthy our society</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.550" end="00:53:23.910" style="s2">so alright I could keep rambling there</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.650" end="00:53:26.760" style="s2">so I haven&#39;t answered your question</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.910" end="00:53:28.650" style="s2">intentionally I&#39;ve just said here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.760" end="00:53:29.310" style="s2">I think about these things if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.650" end="00:53:32.580" style="s2">approach it</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.310" end="00:53:34.170" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t it would be not something you</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.580" end="00:53:37.050" style="s2">can not work out in a napkin</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.170" end="00:53:38.250" style="s2">this is we nassif really deeply and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.050" end="00:53:43.290" style="s2">would actually end up being I think a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.250" end="00:53:44.640" style="s2">politically radical radical project if</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.290" end="00:53:46.620" style="s2">you really figure out how to measure</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.640" end="00:53:49.080" style="s2">some aspect of human interior already</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.620" end="00:53:52.320" style="s2">you realize that live in a culture that</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.080" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">is decimating humanity reorders you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.320" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">really measure learning</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.140" end="00:54:38.730" style="s2">one of the big things we&#39;re developing</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.400" end="00:54:42.390" style="s2">is a UTI or social architecture that</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.730" end="00:54:44.100" style="s2">allows users to in people just hear the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.390" end="00:54:46.800" style="s2">feedback of themselves and their belief</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.100" end="00:54:51.270" style="s2">constructs and systems to the AI rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.800" end="00:54:54.120" style="s2">than new feds will eat that and in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.270" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">way we&#39;re looking at what data we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.120" end="00:55:00.930" style="s2">to be backed users to love the Emir of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:02.730" style="s2">roses and how do you this video the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.930" end="00:55:05.400" style="s2">system to do it by a known population</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.730" end="00:55:08.660" style="s2">data and relational data or give up some</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.400" end="00:55:12.270" style="s2">user centric decentralized kind of tag</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.660" end="00:55:15.870" style="s2">to a larger pool how would you approach</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.270" end="00:55:17.460" style="s2">something like that yeah great question</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.870" end="00:55:23.670" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.460" end="00:55:24.990" style="s2">things kind of emerging and so I&#39;m of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.670" end="00:55:27.510" style="s2">the school that believes you should</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.990" end="00:55:31.140" style="s2">always put the measurement tools in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.510" end="00:55:31.830" style="s2">users hands I don&#39;t think that it should</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.140" end="00:55:36.630" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.830" end="00:55:38.070" style="s2">and a curtain like tada did this magical</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.630" end="00:55:40.800" style="s2">stuff back here and then tada</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.070" end="00:55:43.860" style="s2">like that&#39;s the right approach you need</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.800" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">to let them see how it works and as much</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.860" end="00:55:49.010" style="s2">as possible let them actually configure</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:51.240" style="s2">and play with the assessment themselves</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.010" end="00:55:52.200" style="s2">that&#39;s good for two reasons one is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.240" end="00:55:57.990" style="s2">you&#39;ll end up with a better assessment</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.200" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">system because whatever your team sizes</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.990" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">and the other one is that it empowers as</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:11.400" style="s2">opposed to so again any measurement</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:13.260" style="s2">instance is it&#39;s actually a political</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.400" end="00:56:15.740" style="s2">relationship of power it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.260" end="00:56:20.760" style="s2">scientific relationship of objective</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.740" end="00:56:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not immoral or non relationship</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.760" end="00:56:30.360" style="s2">that&#39;s just two people hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.840" end="00:56:31.620" style="s2">sometimes it is a always a political on</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.360" end="00:56:33.000" style="s2">the street and I was approaching this</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.620" end="00:56:34.800" style="s2">guy what would I do</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.000" end="00:56:36.330" style="s2">I probably like put a table between us</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.800" end="00:56:38.510" style="s2">and show him what I was gonna do to him</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.330" end="00:56:38.510" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.469" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">ancient polar not aged in medieval</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.940" end="00:56:49.160" style="s2">Poland if you were to measure Somoza to</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:51.859" style="s2">hexyl but you weren&#39;t allowed to measure</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.160" end="00:56:53.269" style="s2">people and in fact sometimes doctors</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.859" end="00:56:58.849" style="s2">would come in when you&#39;re sick and all</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.269" end="00:56:59.569" style="s2">they would do is measure you and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.849" end="00:57:01.640" style="s2">people get better</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.569" end="00:57:08.749" style="s2">I mean sometimes obviously they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.640" end="00:57:10.609" style="s2">probably diagnosed at the time but is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.749" end="00:57:13.249" style="s2">very vague which is that as much as</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.609" end="00:57:16.069" style="s2">possible empower the person who&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.249" end="00:57:18.140" style="s2">measured they&#39;re being measured and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.069" end="00:57:19.910" style="s2">actually to be able to augment the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.140" end="00:57:22.759" style="s2">measure so it&#39;s like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.910" end="00:57:24.289" style="s2">mirror and you want to be able to can</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.759" end="00:57:26.359" style="s2">you clean the mirror oh I want to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.289" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">dis angle I want to get that angle you</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.359" end="00:57:29.059" style="s2">know what I mean so they can you turn</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:30.410" style="s2">the mirror around to get that magnifying</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.059" end="00:57:31.400" style="s2">mirror Oh buddy check back because you</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.410" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">know actually you don&#39;t let the night</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.400" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">fine they&#39;re like you want to have that</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:40.089" style="s2">like they&#39;re not some test subject and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.359" end="00:57:42.019" style="s2">they&#39;re not subject to some magical</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.019" end="00:57:47.779" style="s2">they see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.309" end="00:57:49.130" style="s2">and it&#39;s part of their tool kit and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.779" end="00:57:51.559" style="s2">that that would be in general my</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.130" end="00:57:54.619" style="s2">response I think there is a potential to</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.559" end="00:57:58.190" style="s2">do what you&#39;re doing in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.619" end="00:58:01.759" style="s2">quite quite bad for people because for</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.190" end="00:58:02.930" style="s2">example the AI comes back and gives them</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.759" end="00:58:04.069" style="s2">some world view that kind of doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.930" end="00:58:06.410" style="s2">really fit with what they thought about</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.069" end="00:58:11.690" style="s2">themselves that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.410" end="00:58:14.059" style="s2">who do I believe right the magical AI</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.690" end="00:58:15.890" style="s2">who was designed by all these fancy</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.059" end="00:58:18.680" style="s2">people all this money and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.890" end="00:58:21.199" style="s2">how it works and but it says that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.680" end="00:58:29.390" style="s2">know like hell with that big red like</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.199" end="00:58:33.799" style="s2">you are actually a nihilist who do you</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.390" end="00:58:35.959" style="s2">believe like you want them to know how</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.799" end="00:58:37.489" style="s2">this assessment work so that when they</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.959" end="00:58:40.190" style="s2">give the results like okay this this</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.489" end="00:58:42.019" style="s2">makes sense and so that means also a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.190" end="00:58:44.209" style="s2">general thing is that as much as</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.019" end="00:58:48.819" style="s2">possible you want constructive responses</p>

<p begin="00:58:51.360" end="00:58:56.970" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be confused with just semantic</p>

<p begin="00:58:56.970" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">constructive response this is a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.710" end="00:59:02.480" style="s2">question psychometric so just because</p>

<p begin="00:59:02.480" end="00:59:06.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ve given them</p>

<p begin="00:59:08.369" end="00:59:13.080" style="s2">know is bad although a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.690" end="00:59:14.460" style="s2">still use noise but many forms semantic</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.080" end="00:59:19.860" style="s2">analysis are just a really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.460" end="00:59:22.290" style="s2">question and they&#39;re filling in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.860" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">bubbles by writing certain words I just</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.290" end="00:59:27.480" style="s2">don&#39;t realize truly constructive</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:29.880" style="s2">response is one that looks at the</p>

<p begin="00:59:29.880" end="00:59:36.810" style="s2">actually much harder to do with</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.670" end="00:59:39.270" style="s2">intelligence if not impossible so what</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.810" end="00:59:40.080" style="s2">that means is that again by uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.270" end="00:59:42.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.080" end="00:59:46.200" style="s2">how many world believes you got because</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.960" end="00:59:48.900" style="s2">I got an endless variety of world and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.200" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">the question is what is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.900" end="00:59:52.860" style="s2">classification scheme that&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:54.840" style="s2">being produced and does the</p>

<p begin="00:59:57.660" end="01:00:04.500" style="s2">say that every person who took it could</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.730" end="01:00:06.030" style="s2">get a different score not every person</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.500" end="01:00:09.000" style="s2">who takes it gets class into one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.030" end="01:00:12.810" style="s2">eight categories or 120 or one of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.000" end="01:00:15.090" style="s2">hundred or one of a thousand each person</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.810" end="01:00:16.440" style="s2">gets a difference for again you can do</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.090" end="01:00:18.300" style="s2">this if you&#39;re doing complex measuring</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.440" end="01:00:19.800" style="s2">over time right every tree in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.300" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">backyard I tracked it with enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.800" end="01:00:25.950" style="s2">instruments which worked differently</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:28.200" style="s2">period every humans the same way so if</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.950" end="01:00:29.790" style="s2">you&#39;re coming short of that and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.790" end="01:00:34.740" style="s2">instrumental reason you have to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.109" end="01:00:37.170" style="s2">about why you&#39;re doing and so that&#39;s my</p>

<p begin="01:00:37.170" end="01:00:43.950" style="s2">like there&#39;s a conceptual issue with the</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.950" end="01:00:51.869" style="s2">me in a worldview man like try it like</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.990" end="01:00:53.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a fancy artificial intelligence but</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.869" end="01:00:56.040" style="s2">do we really want to start telling</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.670" end="01:00:59.340" style="s2">people that they fit in one of 10 or 100</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.040" end="01:01:00.840" style="s2">of 20 I don&#39;t know that&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.340" end="01:01:02.130" style="s2">philosophical question that a</p>

<p begin="01:01:02.130" end="01:01:07.530" style="s2">long time worrying about</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.440" end="01:01:09.809" style="s2">which people are going on in doing just</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.530" end="01:01:12.299" style="s2">great but again this is unprecedented</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.809" end="01:01:14.130" style="s2">territory we&#39;ve never had a machine that</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.299" end="01:01:18.960" style="s2">told us things about ourselves we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.130" end="01:01:20.970" style="s2">know about ourselves kriesel we used to</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.960" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">do that eventually the computational</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.970" end="01:01:24.569" style="s2">stack could become some kind of</p>

<p begin="01:01:25.500" end="01:02:41.700" style="s2">and we trusted and it measures and not</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.589" end="01:02:43.650" style="s2">physically in the room with you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.700" end="01:02:48.930" style="s2">easy for me to be honest I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.650" end="01:02:51.240" style="s2">too I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.930" end="01:02:57.540" style="s2">late for Facebook that&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.240" end="01:02:59.010" style="s2">like to corrupt ancient regime like all</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.540" end="01:03:00.420" style="s2">that should we&#39;re using to surveil you</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.010" end="01:03:03.510" style="s2">and exploit you and all that stuff now</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.420" end="01:03:06.660" style="s2">you can use these are the masters tools</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.510" end="01:03:10.380" style="s2">man like they were used to exploit into</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.660" end="01:03:14.690" style="s2">trick and to commodify and to surveil</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.380" end="01:03:17.240" style="s2">and to manipulate without consent</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.690" end="01:03:18.650" style="s2">and the idea that we can now now but we</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.240" end="01:03:21.890" style="s2">have access to them now it&#39;s all cool</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.650" end="01:03:22.550" style="s2">guys not at all not at all I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.890" end="01:03:24.290" style="s2">what&#39;s to be done</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.550" end="01:03:28.760" style="s2">in fact like I said it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.290" end="01:03:31.340" style="s2">unprecedented situation and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.760" end="01:03:32.750" style="s2">think again we have the tools to deal</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.340" end="01:03:39.200" style="s2">with a lot of the ethical problems that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.750" end="01:03:41.840" style="s2">we face and this is wonderful and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:43.610" style="s2">so again I think some kind of open</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.840" end="01:03:45.410" style="s2">platform the Galit arianism that allows</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.610" end="01:03:47.450" style="s2">people to build something like Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.410" end="01:03:49.810" style="s2">might be interesting the question of</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.450" end="01:03:52.190" style="s2">whether people are even interested now</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.810" end="01:03:53.900" style="s2">because the damage has been done and</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.190" end="01:03:56.780" style="s2">they&#39;d rather just stick with Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.900" end="01:03:58.760" style="s2">and make do sounds a lot like what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.780" end="01:04:03.110" style="s2">been doing with capitalism for the past</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.760" end="01:04:04.340" style="s2">34 years I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much time</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.110" end="01:04:08.690" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.340" end="01:04:12.500" style="s2">and so I actively worked to tell people</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.690" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">to get off Facebook so I record you to</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.500" end="01:04:18.200" style="s2">do that for exactly the reasons I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:21.080" style="s2">just been discussing so I you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.200" end="01:04:23.030" style="s2">idea of fixing it is like the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.080" end="01:04:26.320" style="s2">fixing the public schools to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.030" end="01:04:28.610" style="s2">like no you know we need to something</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.320" end="01:04:33.500" style="s2">profoundly different so I&#39;m profoundly</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.610" end="01:04:37.190" style="s2">new and measurement is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.500" end="01:04:40.550" style="s2">reason why I so it&#39;s not I mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.190" end="01:04:43.340" style="s2">a happy answer I think actually in fact</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.550" end="01:04:47.060" style="s2">the possibility of pivoting towards some</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.340" end="01:04:48.530" style="s2">type of infrastructure that has many of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.060" end="01:04:51.020" style="s2">the affordances of Facebook even</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.530" end="01:04:53.450" style="s2">psychometrically for self-reflection is</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.020" end="01:04:55.910" style="s2">huge so one way to think about it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.450" end="01:04:58.490" style="s2">like the nuclear power plant that came</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.910" end="01:05:01.460" style="s2">from the Manhattan Project all right the</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.490" end="01:05:04.310" style="s2">bad guys built all of this stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.460" end="01:05:05.870" style="s2">there are humane uses for it right but</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.310" end="01:05:08.870" style="s2">we have to take it off the military base</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.870" end="01:05:14.060" style="s2">and literally with Facebook military</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.870" end="01:05:17.440" style="s2">base and bring it to a place where the</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.060" end="01:05:20.150" style="s2">citizens can look at what&#39;s available</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.440" end="01:05:25.340" style="s2">some find some kind of agreement about</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.150" end="01:05:27.299" style="s2">how to use this incredibly powerful for</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.340" end="01:05:30.899" style="s2">you know relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.299" end="01:05:31.979" style="s2">measurement and again so it may be that</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.899" end="01:05:36.029" style="s2">we decide that we don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.979" end="01:05:38.009" style="s2">something like this again after the and</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.029" end="01:05:40.499" style="s2">again I&#39;m I&#39;m predicting not a happy</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.009" end="01:05:42.689" style="s2">future if the state of the internet and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.499" end="01:05:44.909" style="s2">the informational you go system remains</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.689" end="01:05:47.729" style="s2">as it is the egg is symmetric</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.909" end="01:05:50.479" style="s2">informational environments alone coupled</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.729" end="01:05:54.509" style="s2">with economic inequality assure massive</p>
