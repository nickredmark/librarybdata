<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">that something else is almost always a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">kind of statism</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">or you know a kind of paganism so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing and i say</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">every day for people who adhere to their</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">religious beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">uh and i do uh have a greater</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">appreciation for the value that that has</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">brought to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">american society in particular and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">know at least maybe it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">our circles but i do feel like there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">a growing revival perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">or at least an appreciation for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">benefits that come from</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">a society that is ordered in that</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">important also to point out that like</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">america is really built on christian</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">values and so it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">a religious country even if it&#39;s you</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.680" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">that was an interesting twilight space</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">to operate in there like on the fringes</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">but like still with one ear and the sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">of real world but then also in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">creative space</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">and you know that creative underground i</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">think is important and i wonder where</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">is today honestly if if there&#39;s any such</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">thing as because back then we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">were dissident right</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">right you know artists and dissident</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">you know scene anywhere right now it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">seems to me that all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">creative art and the art fringes are</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">really just rehashing and regurgitating</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">sort of the party lines these days</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">yeah i mean that&#39;s how it seems i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">that there is uh i&#39;m sure that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">that maybe we don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">um but it&#39;s all changed you know the</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">internet has made a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">possible that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">um that were not previously possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s closed a lot of doors but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">also opened a lot of doors as well so</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:27.519" style="s2">you don&#39;t necessarily need to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">in approximate physical space you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">know i think the whole point of the book</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">too is kind of like a mcguffin</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">which is um it&#39;s supposed to be about uh</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">civilization on a path and and define</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.480" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">what what we have here in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">regime at the end of the day are ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">and his big concept was</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">that we are now living through the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">of a particular set of ideas a</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">point that he made</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:20.640" style="s2">that i i thought was was kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.640" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">was that um was that on one hand he he</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:27.039" style="s2">breaks down</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">i haven&#39;t heard anyone else make this</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">point but it&#39;s kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of bright which</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">if you can go and you can listen to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">a louis armstrong record from 1927</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">and you try to approximate 1927 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">and then you can figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">really special about that record</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">right because because the other way you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">like the the kind of historicist way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">do it doing it is the um</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">is the default right so you put on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">louis armstrong record and it&#39;s 20 20</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">and you listen to it and you say this</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">sounds like oh this sounds utterly</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">foreign</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s totally incomprehensible you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a beat there you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">looking for all these things that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">that are present in modern music that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not present in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">in you know in 1927 with uh with with</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">armstrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">and that gets in the way of us</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">uh what makes some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">special</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">so immediately that kind of idea uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">resonated with me and and that idea has</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">all kinds of implications throughout</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">um you know not only throughout uh uh of</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">you know political philosophy but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">you know our our everyday lives</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">so um so i decided that i was gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">in national security in dc</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">and and you know people thought i was</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">of what i wanted to do sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">phase of my life which is to work in</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">information operations man we are going</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">to definitely get to that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">all around everywhere we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">participating in that ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">uh one one side note on the the strauss</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">i i have been talking to more and more</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:09.679" style="s2">straussians it seems these days and my</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.679" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">for the old uh ism</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">is increasing and my sense that uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">anything new is better is also decline</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">uh and uh it&#39;s interesting to to even</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">consider the fact that at one point</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:30.640" style="s2">people didn&#39;t consult ancient texts and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to look backwards and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">see value in aristotle or plato and like</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">pushed it aside it was old news man old</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">news right</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">and there seems to have been and there</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">is a revival</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">among that and i guess maybe the circles</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">i run in are so steeped in this that</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">when i began to learn what straussian</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">really meant</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">i was like wait what people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">actually you know read the old text and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">connect to universal truths that span</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">time and space in the past that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">weird like it seems like common sense to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">but uh it is it is sort of uh is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">fringe i don&#39;t know it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">at least it&#39;s not mainstream uh and uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly deep in my appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">you know humans are humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve been very human-y for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">and people have</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">figured out sort of the downsides and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">the upsides and how to manage things</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">and just because it&#39;s old doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">it&#39;s bad and i think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a theme that is bubbling</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">up within right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.279" style="s2">and and and should continue to carry</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">some some additional momentum moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s right and and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">really applies to anything because if</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">you think</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">you know if um</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">i mean what do you appreciate about if</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">you start to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">what you get from things that are old or</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">if you start to think</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">what do what do you get from from</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">anything um</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">it it causes you to to evaluate things i</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t take very much to uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">you know to to kind of snap out of um of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">let&#39;s say i mean we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">about modern music to just snap out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">modern music and say you know what this</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">this is you know this is is um</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t give me anything in my soul</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">i&#39;m only hearing it now because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">being</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">the the communists and a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">wanted to emulate the fascists</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">because they saw within islam um</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">you know a way to harmonize their</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.520" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">when you had</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">you know you had situations like egypt</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">or nasa</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">had situations like you know bath party</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">were kind of groping around trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">what the next thing would be that would</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">um solve their problems and push them</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">you know third world into first world</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">because they realized after the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">world war especially that they were</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">woefully behind</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">the west so they wanted to catch up and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">they wanted to use</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">um you know different different</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">political systems and political</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">arrangements in order to catch up</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">so they went through the an arab phase</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">they went through the the um</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">let&#39;s say the the the communist</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">socialist</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">um uh fascist totalitarian phase</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">um and then they went through an</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">islamist phase</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">and the islamist phase now is is is this</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">kind of the high point of that was it</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">was the arab spring</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">um but it had gone it had gone on for</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">you know for</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">30 years and that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">um exemplified both by the muslim</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">brotherhood and by</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">osama bin laden and al-qaeda and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">said hey we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">address this population here as the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">islamic umma and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">and national borders don&#39;t matter as</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">much because we&#39;re you know we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.839" end="00:36:59.359" style="s2">you know we&#39;re going to organize all</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">muslims to you know defend against or</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">defeat the crusaders the non-muslims all</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">and this was kind of the template that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">we saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">before 9 11 this was the template that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">people like sam huntington would see</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">in the in the uh in the early 90s and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">late 80s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">um and sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">this concept um after the uh the arab</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">spring just</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">just ran out of steam and it had some</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">in that respect because of the obama</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">administration the obama administration</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">totally bought into this line and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">kind of unthinkingly helped along this</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">um this islamist phase by in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">know obama</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">gets uh you know he takes the presidency</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">first speech he gives he goes to cairo</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">and he addresses the islamic oma well</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">what he should have done</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">was he should have addressed the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">of these different countries</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">directly as citizens of these other</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.839" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s a good good point</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">what what was obama&#39;s motivations and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">can talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">more about what he actually did in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">middle east but like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">some people people will say that he you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">know was trying to undermine america and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">support muslims and la</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">la all kinds of theories and such but</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">like you say unwittingly so you think</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">obama simply was mistaken in what he did</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">malicious um i think that&#39;s too big of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">i think that&#39;s too big of a category in</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">this respect i think he was mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:44.560" style="s2">in other ways he was malicious i this</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">this is one of my big pet peeves about</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">about politics today i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">because a lot of people who come to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">the right conclusion about things</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:43:00.560" style="s2">has has happened and um the other big</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">the other big issue was the uh was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.560" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">qatar the saudi and uae that happened in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">the summer of 2017.</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">there was a blockade and all this and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">what was the what was the point</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">of this conflict the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:16.319" style="s2">conflict was</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">saudis and emiratis and egyptians and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.319" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">others were accusing the qataris</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">of using the muslim brotherhood and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">al-jazeera</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">in order to destabilize their countries</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:28.480" style="s2">which was exactly what happened during</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">the arab spring you know or</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.480" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">attempted and they said cut it out</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t want your your garbage</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">brought</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">you know your your anti-regime</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:41.119" style="s2">propaganda broadcast into our uh into</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">our countries</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.119" end="00:43:45.119" style="s2">so that was sort of the genesis of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">conflict and that necessarily pushed</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.119" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">um you know it uh it sort of solidified</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">an anti-islamist bloc</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">in the middle east uh led by saudi and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">uh and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">the uae and and for that reason they</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">found a lot of commonality with</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">um with with the israelis because at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">same time they were coming to these</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">conclusions they were realizing wait a</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">if israel disappears tomorrow and is</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">replaced by a palestinian terror state</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">led by hamas which is really the only</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">you know scenario that&#39;s that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">remotely likely</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">um you know such as it is are we going</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">to be in a better position or are we</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">going to be in a worse position</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">hamas going to uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">is is a palestinian state going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">um beneficial us in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">security and helping us defend ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">against iran</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:45.359" style="s2">is a palestinian state going to going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">be beneficial to us in terms of um</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">in terms of technology and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.560" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">and scientific expertise and all these</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">so they realized wait a minute we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">actually have a lot to um</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">we&#39;d suffer a lot if israel was was gone</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">which was a realization that uh that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">just dawned on them</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">after you know after after decades of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">trying to remove it from the map so they</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">realized</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">wait a minute we you know we we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">good thing here so so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">opened the door to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:17.839" style="s2">to uh to more settlements cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">and peace</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">eight years</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.200" end="01:00:01.359" style="s2">tried to de-prioritize our relationships</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">by elevating iran by making a deal with</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:35.119" style="s2">when the uh trump administration</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:37.280" style="s2">first walked through the door the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.119" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">iranians were kind of de facto in</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.280" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">control of five</p>

<p begin="01:00:44.720" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">had um</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.680" end="01:00:52.400" style="s2">you had uh sana and yemen you had</p>

<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:02.799" style="s2">and uh and then you also had um</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.160" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">and then of course you also had iran so</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.799" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">these companies these countries were</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">were you know slowly being taken over</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">by iran and this had to stop the obama</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">people were</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">you know totally behind this at least it</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">showed no indication that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">they put up any resistance and i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">the trump people came in saying yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">got to reverse this and bring it back to</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">sort of the natural state of affairs</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">um and and that&#39;s what they said about</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:30.720" style="s2">doing you know there&#39;s a reason why the</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">first trip was to saudi arabia because</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.720" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">saudi arabia is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:36.000" style="s2">most uh important uh country in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">region</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.000" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">that is uh that is muslim and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">very significantly he went to saudi</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">arabia and then he also went to</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:46.319" style="s2">jerusalem</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:47.920" style="s2">at the same time same trip and i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.319" end="01:01:51.359" style="s2">people saw this</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.920" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">um and and finally our our allies there</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.359" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">who had you know lost their voice</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">already screaming for for eight years um</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">uh uh against the um</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:04.799" style="s2">against the obama administration they</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">were very happy to see that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.799" end="01:02:09.920" style="s2">you know somebody is you know that uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">they have an ally back in the white</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.920" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">house so</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">this is so this is what&#39;s going on i</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">think in general too as far as israel</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:20.880" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:23.760" style="s2">it just it just shows that um</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">for the last several decades the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.760" end="01:02:27.599" style="s2">assumption was</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:28.720" style="s2">that in order to get a good deal in the</p>

<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like when uh on one side when one</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.839" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">side wants to</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">to to uh make an agreement and the other</p>

<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.640" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">that you die why have the negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">why bother why you know but once you</p>

<p begin="01:03:44.720" end="01:03:48.079" style="s2">um so so that was</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.160" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">that was another big thing that uh the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.079" end="01:03:51.760" style="s2">trump people knew going in</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:54.160" style="s2">that uh that they were that they were</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.760" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">going to do i mean i&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.160" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">things didn&#39;t fall in the lap and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:04:00.559" style="s2">not saying that um</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">that they did all of this you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.559" end="01:04:05.119" style="s2">tremendous amount of credit</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:06.319" style="s2">um to to the leaders of these countries</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.119" end="01:04:07.920" style="s2">because at the end of the day they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.319" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">the ones that uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">that uh you know that kind of grabbed</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">the ring and and uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:15.839" style="s2">and made this possible so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:18.240" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.839" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">right i think that there there is</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.240" end="01:04:22.960" style="s2">obviously a sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:23.440" style="s2">a media line excuse me that that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.960" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">trump</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.440" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">trump is incoherent babbling has no</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">logic</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">has no sense he&#39;s just a bull and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">just breaking</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">breaking plates and destroying the china</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.760" end="01:04:35.760" style="s2">shop and pooping all over the town</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:38.960" style="s2">and he does it all impulsively without</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.760" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">any thinking but there is a coherence</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.960" end="01:04:43.200" style="s2">between talking about american</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">nationalism on showing onshoring</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.200" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">american manufacturing doing deals that</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.359" end="01:04:49.359" style="s2">favor the american people versus the</p>

<p begin="01:04:49.359" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">and trans transnational corporations</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.319" end="01:04:57.039" style="s2">there is a coherence between that</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:58.640" style="s2">and the foreign policy approach taken in</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.039" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">the middle east</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.640" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">and i i pray i hope</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">history looks back on that and sees a</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.400" end="01:05:07.760" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:09.440" style="s2">and that gets for me like becomes more</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.760" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">obvious and crystallized</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.440" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">after the noise goes away right like so</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:16.760" style="s2">much all this [ __ ] is noise the daily</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">social media the daily media uh</p>

<p begin="01:05:21.119" end="01:05:25.359" style="s2">the info space to distract everybody and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:28.480" style="s2">get us all confused and worked up</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.359" end="01:05:30.400" style="s2">once that stuff calms uh and and they</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.480" end="01:05:31.599" style="s2">start to look back and judge the trump</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.400" end="01:05:33.839" style="s2">administration</p>

<p begin="01:05:35.839" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.039" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">uh i think that there&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">greater appreciation for what has taken</p>

<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">but like mainstream wise nobody said</p>

<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">see a lot of these populist movements uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.119" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">bringing up um and</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a really special uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">situation that we&#39;re in and um</p>

<p begin="01:07:55.280" end="01:07:59.119" style="s2">is far greater than you know many old</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:01.200" style="s2">divides</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.119" end="01:08:03.359" style="s2">used to be between uh between enemy</p>

<p begin="01:08:03.359" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">indeed indeed uh i keep returning to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">idea that there is</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:14.000" style="s2">in in american foreign policy</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:15.359" style="s2">or i don&#39;t know you know it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.000" end="01:08:16.719" style="s2">inconsistent all over the place so i</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.359" end="01:08:18.080" style="s2">can&#39;t make any generalizations but</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.719" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">there&#39;s these two notions right</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.080" end="01:08:24.719" style="s2">of like acceptance and plurality</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:26.239" style="s2">and and sort of like your dominating</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:28.560" style="s2">hegemonic sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.239" end="01:08:30.640" style="s2">viewpoint or thrust where you want to go</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.560" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">and i feel like uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.640" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">domestically there are people who uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:40.480" style="s2">will will scream for pluralism plurality</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">in in america but then abroad</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.480" end="01:08:44.480" style="s2">you know want a hedge a hegemonic</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:47.679" style="s2">perspective and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.480" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">you know america only right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:51.279" style="s2">a conflict between what happens</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">with us domestically and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.279" end="01:08:56.239" style="s2">happening around the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.679" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">and you and i were talking earlier and</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.239" end="01:09:00.480" style="s2">you noted</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.359" end="01:09:01.920" style="s2">that as the middle east appears to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.480" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">coming together</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.920" end="01:09:05.600" style="s2">and in a way accepting their plurality</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:09.279" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.600" end="01:09:11.040" style="s2">tearing ourselves apart at home</p>

<p begin="01:09:12.640" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s just an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.480" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">dichotomy what are you feeling right now</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:20.239" style="s2">do you feel things coming together there</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:22.799" style="s2">and things coming apart</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.239" end="01:09:23.839" style="s2">here why is that happening what is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.799" end="01:09:27.520" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.839" end="01:09:29.120" style="s2">are they related yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.520" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">i think they&#39;re related in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.120" end="01:09:32.560" style="s2">that um you know what</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:35.279" style="s2">kind of the phenomenon that we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.560" end="01:09:37.759" style="s2">talking about about um</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:38.799" style="s2">if you want to say you know nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.759" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">be globalism</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.799" end="01:09:43.440" style="s2">on on a world state kind of country to</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:45.839" style="s2">country uh in that respect but</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.440" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">you know we&#39;re coming apart really it</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.839" end="01:09:50.719" style="s2">was it was bloom</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:52.520" style="s2">that convinced me i mean i i had an idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.719" end="01:09:54.880" style="s2">then that we were coming apart in an</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.520" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">irreconcilable way</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.880" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">um you know when after after reading uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">bloom</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:03.090" style="s2">because at the end of the day we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:04.400" style="s2">have an agreement on what justice is</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.090" end="01:10:07.360" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.400" end="01:10:08.400" style="s2">between us and these are really the most</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.360" end="01:10:10.640" style="s2">important things</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.400" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">and and you know he he kind of made me</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.640" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">see that that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.000" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">the things that we describe as</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">you know the the things that that i mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.880" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have concepts of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:26.719" style="s2">in common if we have no understanding</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:31.040" style="s2">for example equal justice</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.719" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">right of equal justice under the law</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.040" end="01:10:38.159" style="s2">or or you know let&#39;s say a guy a man</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.040" end="01:10:41.920" style="s2">is uh you know a man is</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.159" end="01:10:43.120" style="s2">uh is not guilty or innocent based on</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.920" end="01:10:45.760" style="s2">his race</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.120" end="01:10:46.880" style="s2">but based on the things that he has done</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.760" end="01:10:50.000" style="s2">that seems so</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.880" end="01:10:53.760" style="s2">basic it seems so basic</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.000" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">um and yet we have half our population</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.760" end="01:10:57.040" style="s2">has given up that that concept</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:10:59.679" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.040" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">so what do you do about that how do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.679" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">how do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">teach how do you teach people</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.440" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">that concept because that is a fragile</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:09.760" style="s2">enlightenment thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:12.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s not that that is thing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.760" end="01:11:13.040" style="s2">took you know tens of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.159" end="01:11:16.800" style="s2">to develop</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.040" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">initially and to lose it is very very</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.800" end="01:11:20.880" style="s2">easy and i mean we&#39;ve seen we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:23.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost it let&#39;s say in the last 30</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:25.840" style="s2">years uh but really intensely</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.280" end="01:11:27.120" style="s2">only in the last you know five or ten</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.840" end="01:11:29.600" style="s2">but it could take</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.120" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">another 300 years to bring it back for</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.600" end="01:11:32.400" style="s2">people to really understand the</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:35.040" style="s2">consequences of these things</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.400" end="01:11:35.840" style="s2">i mean when i was growing up and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.040" end="01:11:39.760" style="s2">probably around</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.840" end="01:11:43.920" style="s2">you know the same age we used to</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">we used to talk about the skokie nazis</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:48.560" style="s2">and that was an issue i mean i went to a</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">religious jewish school</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.560" end="01:11:52.239" style="s2">and one of the debates that we had in in</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">class was</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.239" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">okay do you outlaw you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:11:58.960" style="s2">nazis marching in</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:11:59.920" style="s2">um in in skokie illinois where they have</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.960" end="01:12:02.640" style="s2">a large</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.920" end="01:12:04.400" style="s2">um uh population of holocaust survivors</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.640" end="01:12:07.360" style="s2">and jews</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.400" end="01:12:07.760" style="s2">and you know and we sort of debate this</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:10.400" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.760" end="01:12:10.800" style="s2">in you know fourth grade or fifth grade</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.400" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.800" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">and the teacher made us see that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.120" end="01:12:17.360" style="s2">know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:18.000" style="s2">you know i mean you know you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.360" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">ban them</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.000" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">because there are larger principles at</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:22.719" style="s2">stake they&#39;re a larger kind of freedom</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">principles at stake and</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.719" end="01:12:26.480" style="s2">at the end of the day in order to agree</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">to live in</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.480" end="01:12:31.040" style="s2">a country that has freedom you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.640" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">to have to accept the messy result</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.040" end="01:12:35.120" style="s2">which is that you know a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">holocaust survivors</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.120" end="01:12:38.320" style="s2">have to see some nazis marching down the</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:41.520" style="s2">street okay well</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.320" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">you you accept that result for</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.520" end="01:12:46.960" style="s2">the more important result of being able</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">to express yourself freely</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.960" end="01:12:51.199" style="s2">and have free association um you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:53.520" style="s2">across the board</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.199" end="01:12:55.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you know the the you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.520" end="01:12:56.880" style="s2">you accept the bad thing in order to</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.440" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">make the much</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.880" end="01:13:00.000" style="s2">the much better more important thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:02.880" style="s2">possible well</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.000" end="01:13:03.199" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost sight of that i mean even you</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.880" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.199" end="01:13:07.120" style="s2">the aclu which which which fought you</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">know on behalf of the nazis</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.120" end="01:13:12.400" style="s2">today would do no such thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:13.920" style="s2">you know because because they&#39;ll they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.400" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">claim that um</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.920" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">you know they&#39;ll claim that uh that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:17.760" style="s2">know the presence of the nazis</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.760" end="01:13:21.280" style="s2">you know physical harm and emotional</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">yadda yadda</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.280" end="01:13:25.280" style="s2">so yeah so once once we&#39;ve abandoned</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:26.480" style="s2">that i mean what what what do we have</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.280" end="01:13:28.719" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.480" end="01:13:30.159" style="s2">there there is definitely a competing</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.719" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">notions of justice</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.159" end="01:13:34.880" style="s2">uh in our society today a lot outlined</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:37.920" style="s2">very well i think it&#39;s caldwell</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.880" end="01:13:38.480" style="s2">outlined that in age of enlightenment uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.920" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.480" end="01:13:43.280" style="s2">certainly we have an idea of justice of</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:46.480" style="s2">equal opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.280" end="01:13:49.520" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a competing invalid</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.480" end="01:13:50.159" style="s2">uh notion of uh equal outcomes and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.520" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.159" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">instead of our version justice uh sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:13:56.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">liberating freedoms and allowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.320" end="01:13:59.760" style="s2">freedoms</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:01.120" style="s2">and the the competing notion is actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.760" end="01:14:03.760" style="s2">takings from people</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.120" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">and givings to others in what is</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.760" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">necessarily an arbitrary and capricious</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:09.280" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:09.760" style="s2">and so these completing notions of</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.280" end="01:14:13.920" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.760" end="01:14:15.120" style="s2">are are so fundamentally problematic</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.920" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.120" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">america whatever you want i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:20.320" style="s2">talked to anton about american</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.800" end="01:14:21.440" style="s2">nationalism what does it mean where does</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.320" end="01:14:24.800" style="s2">it come from it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.440" end="01:14:26.400" style="s2">something to debate uh but uh the the</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.800" end="01:14:28.640" style="s2">if if we don&#39;t at least have an</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.400" end="01:14:31.440" style="s2">agreement on justice</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.640" end="01:14:31.760" style="s2">then we really don&#39;t have an agreement</p>

<p begin="01:18:32.320" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">and they&#39;ll say okay the you know the</p>

<p begin="01:20:49.280" end="01:20:53.199" style="s2">here is</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.320" end="01:20:54.880" style="s2">to divide the country and uh and and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.199" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">really to to get out</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.880" end="01:21:02.400" style="s2">and to attempt to build new institutions</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:05.920" style="s2">that um you know from the ground up</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.400" end="01:21:07.679" style="s2">that are maybe more modest um</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.920" end="01:21:09.199" style="s2">and and and more geographically</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.679" end="01:21:12.560" style="s2">contained so i</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.199" end="01:21:16.400" style="s2">i i really don&#39;t see um a</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.560" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">a good future for the united states</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.400" end="01:21:20.480" style="s2">in terms of the things that that that we</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:23.360" style="s2">believe i just i just don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:21:23.360" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">you&#39;re making me</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.159" end="01:21:27.360" style="s2">breathe heavy over here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:30.480" style="s2">it&#39;s sad</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.360" end="01:21:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;s sad uh the analogy</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.480" end="01:21:34.320" style="s2">i like to bring up is that at some point</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.800" end="01:21:37.600" style="s2">you gotta realize</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.320" end="01:21:38.639" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re in a burlap sack with a</p>

<p begin="01:21:38.639" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">and you know who&#39;s gonna come out right</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.040" end="01:21:44.560" style="s2">like remember ricky tikitavi they used</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.719" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">to take the mongrels and open the sack</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.560" end="01:21:47.520" style="s2">with the cobra</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:49.199" style="s2">tie it up and who you know who&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.520" end="01:21:51.840" style="s2">to win right there&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.199" end="01:21:53.199" style="s2">one choice and uh that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.840" end="01:21:55.440" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that people</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.199" end="01:21:56.560" style="s2">realize that yet or have come to accept</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.440" end="01:21:59.040" style="s2">it uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.560" end="01:22:00.159" style="s2">that the the the whole thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.040" end="01:22:01.920" style="s2">based in</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.159" end="01:22:04.400" style="s2">largely critical race theory and</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.920" end="01:22:06.320" style="s2">progressivism and the radical left</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.400" end="01:22:07.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not radical in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.320" end="01:22:09.199" style="s2">they&#39;ve taken over all the institutions</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.920" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">they&#39;re not fringe</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.199" end="01:22:12.320" style="s2">they may be small minority but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:15.360" style="s2">exceptionally powerful</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.320" end="01:22:18.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re in extremely high leverage</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.360" end="01:22:19.199" style="s2">positions and they have can what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.400" end="01:22:22.000" style="s2">word that they</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.199" end="01:22:22.560" style="s2">converge they&#39;ve like converged all of</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.000" end="01:22:24.880" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.560" end="01:22:27.360" style="s2">major institutional pillars within the</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.880" end="01:22:29.120" style="s2">country and even the world basically</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.360" end="01:22:31.600" style="s2">said even with four more years of trump</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.120" end="01:22:33.520" style="s2">we&#39;re still not going to eradicate that</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.600" end="01:22:36.239" style="s2">that&#39;s what people don&#39;t get sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.520" end="01:22:39.199" style="s2">is that trump is not only</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.239" end="01:22:40.719" style="s2">fighting against critical race theory</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.199" end="01:22:42.480" style="s2">the woken those people but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.719" end="01:22:44.719" style="s2">fighting within his own government</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.480" end="01:22:46.080" style="s2">he&#39;s got it&#39;s not as if he came in took</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.719" end="01:22:48.000" style="s2">over the government and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.080" end="01:22:49.600" style="s2">there was an army acting in unison and</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.000" end="01:22:51.120" style="s2">everybody&#39;s supporting it as you pointed</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.600" end="01:22:53.440" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.120" end="01:22:54.639" style="s2">he has to struggle on a daily basis just</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.440" end="01:22:57.920" style="s2">to get things done</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.639" end="01:22:59.600" style="s2">i random i i just</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.920" end="01:23:00.800" style="s2">think about what the world would have</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.600" end="01:23:02.719" style="s2">looked like or what the trump</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.800" end="01:23:06.000" style="s2">administration would look like had</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.719" end="01:23:09.120" style="s2">anton bannon beatty and</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.000" end="01:23:12.719" style="s2">others stuck around and had a chance</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.120" end="01:23:15.199" style="s2">to and flynn had a chance to actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.719" end="01:23:16.560" style="s2">implement you know maybe in a more</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.199" end="01:23:19.920" style="s2">robust manner</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.560" end="01:23:22.320" style="s2">uh what the president uh had uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.920" end="01:23:24.080" style="s2">had correctly identified as major issues</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.320" end="01:23:27.360" style="s2">for us moving forward</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.080" end="01:23:29.199" style="s2">unfortunately the the the deconstruction</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.360" end="01:23:31.679" style="s2">of the united states and and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.199" end="01:23:34.800" style="s2">erection of more barriers</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.679" end="01:23:36.400" style="s2">uh is on theme globally um</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.800" end="01:23:38.080" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing it all over the place we</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.400" end="01:23:40.880" style="s2">see it in science we see it in</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.080" end="01:23:42.960" style="s2">biology we see it in the pandemic we are</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.880" end="01:23:46.560" style="s2">social distancing</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.960" end="01:23:49.199" style="s2">is going to become sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.560" end="01:23:50.400" style="s2">our country&#39;s infrastructure like the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.199" end="01:23:52.800" style="s2">setup i mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.400" end="01:23:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s ironic that we&#39;re being ironic</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.800" end="01:23:55.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that&#39;s right word</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.000" end="01:23:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s shitty and weird that we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.520" end="01:23:58.639" style="s2">introduced to this notion of social</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.040" end="01:24:00.960" style="s2">distancing through the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.639" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">but at the same time it&#39;s like okay so</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.960" end="01:24:03.600" style="s2">maybe it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:05.280" style="s2">entirely healthy for us to all be</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.600" end="01:24:06.880" style="s2">together rubbing shoulders and on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.280" end="01:24:08.960" style="s2">same team and maybe we just do need to</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.880" end="01:24:10.400" style="s2">take a step back and erect a barrier</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.960" end="01:24:12.159" style="s2">decide what comes through and what</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.400" end="01:24:12.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t in a healthy way just like your</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.159" end="01:24:17.040" style="s2">cells do</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.960" end="01:24:20.480" style="s2">inside of your body and you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.040" end="01:24:22.880" style="s2">that trend is squarely in place</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.480" end="01:24:23.600" style="s2">unfortunately and so what what do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.880" end="01:24:27.040" style="s2">think people</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.600" end="01:24:28.480" style="s2">should do on a well no</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.040" end="01:24:30.159" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to get to that i want to</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.480" end="01:24:32.400" style="s2">talk a little bit more even about the</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.159" end="01:24:34.400" style="s2">the internal forces that are working to</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.400" end="01:24:36.960" style="s2">destabilize our current regime</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.400" end="01:24:38.639" style="s2">and when you say regime the first time i</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.960" end="01:24:41.040" style="s2">read it in a context i didn&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.639" end="01:24:44.159" style="s2">neutral right i read regime i&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.040" end="01:24:45.120" style="s2">negative that&#39;s horrible right nasty but</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.159" end="01:24:47.040" style="s2">it just means</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.120" end="01:24:48.960" style="s2">you know sort of our established system</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.040" end="01:24:52.080" style="s2">of government yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.960" end="01:24:54.960" style="s2">and so uh talking to darren</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.080" end="01:24:56.239" style="s2">he&#39;s pretty convinced that the similar</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.960" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">tactics that were used</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.239" end="01:24:59.600" style="s2">in eastern europe and perhaps arab</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">spring and</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.600" end="01:25:03.600" style="s2">elsewhere are being used here in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:06.560" style="s2">united states in the version</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.600" end="01:25:08.000" style="s2">of what he called color revolution do</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.560" end="01:25:10.880" style="s2">you think that there is</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.000" end="01:25:12.880" style="s2">a connection between what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.880" end="01:25:15.199" style="s2">the united states the preparation for</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.880" end="01:25:18.159" style="s2">fighting the election the litigation</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.199" end="01:25:18.480" style="s2">the information you know pollution of</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.159" end="01:25:21.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.480" end="01:25:24.560" style="s2">information space the mass uprisings</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.600" end="01:25:26.159" style="s2">quote peaceful protests etc is there</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.560" end="01:25:29.280" style="s2">really a relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.159" end="01:25:31.600" style="s2">that and and arab spring and and uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.280" end="01:25:33.280" style="s2">color revolutions in europe i mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.600" end="01:25:34.800" style="s2">is it the same thing is the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.280" end="01:25:36.239" style="s2">happening are they the same people</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.800" end="01:25:38.800" style="s2">that&#39;s making this happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.239" end="01:25:40.639" style="s2">what are your thoughts on that yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.800" end="01:25:41.440" style="s2">mean i largely agree with darren on this</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.639" end="01:25:44.000" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.440" end="01:25:45.840" style="s2">um a lot of the criticisms that have</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.000" end="01:25:48.639" style="s2">come his way</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.840" end="01:25:50.400" style="s2">both from uh you know from deep state</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.639" end="01:25:53.520" style="s2">people and also from people who are</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.400" end="01:25:55.920" style="s2">you know who are uh more friendly have</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.520" end="01:25:58.480" style="s2">kind of focused and fixated on the term</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.920" end="01:25:59.920" style="s2">color revolution</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.480" end="01:26:01.520" style="s2">which at the end of the day it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.920" end="01:26:03.199" style="s2">matter what you call it</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.520" end="01:26:05.360" style="s2">right we&#39;re talking about a particular</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.199" end="01:26:07.600" style="s2">phenomenon in the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.360" end="01:26:09.440" style="s2">a lot of these folks went crazy when the</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.600" end="01:26:11.840" style="s2">first time i think rush limbaugh used</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.440" end="01:26:13.840" style="s2">the word deep state</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.840" end="01:26:16.320" style="s2">and everyone was like no it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.840" end="01:26:18.239" style="s2">the deep state in in turkey and in egypt</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.320" end="01:26:19.440" style="s2">well no it&#39;s not like the deep state in</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.239" end="01:26:21.440" style="s2">turkey in egypt</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.440" end="01:26:23.679" style="s2">but it is a thing that you know i mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.440" end="01:26:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s shorthand let&#39;s not get</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.679" end="01:26:28.000" style="s2">too hung up on the name when we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:27:42.000" end="01:27:47.760" style="s2">this is the the united states has had</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.679" end="01:27:50.080" style="s2">this particular capability in its</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.760" end="01:27:53.120" style="s2">toolkit and i think what i know that</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.080" end="01:27:54.719" style="s2">you know my my old friend uh eli lake</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.120" end="01:27:55.920" style="s2">was was kind of very critical of this</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.719" end="01:27:59.280" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.920" end="01:28:02.480" style="s2">um this particular terminology because</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.280" end="01:28:04.239" style="s2">in his mind it kind of um</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.480" end="01:28:06.080" style="s2">it didn&#39;t give enough credit to some of</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.239" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">the local</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.080" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">folks on the other end of uh in</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:12.840" style="s2">some of the local folks who were kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:14.880" style="s2">democratic activists in some of these</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.840" end="01:28:16.480" style="s2">countries i don&#39;t think darren was</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.880" end="01:28:18.080" style="s2">necessarily when he used the word color</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.480" end="01:28:19.440" style="s2">revolution making a point and saying</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.080" end="01:28:20.480" style="s2">that all of these were particularly</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.440" end="01:28:22.560" style="s2">illegitimate</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.480" end="01:28:24.480" style="s2">i think in general he was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.560" end="01:28:27.600" style="s2">the particular toolkit</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.480" end="01:28:28.320" style="s2">and a map of how you do it and i know</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.600" end="01:28:29.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a map</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.320" end="01:28:31.679" style="s2">how you do it i mean the guy that that</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.840" end="01:28:33.520" style="s2">he had referenced has a book on</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.679" end="01:28:34.800" style="s2">you know this is this is how you do it</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.520" end="01:28:38.880" style="s2">you know you mobilize</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.800" end="01:28:41.440" style="s2">right a um a playbook exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.880" end="01:28:43.040" style="s2">so um i think that&#39;s sort of what we</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.440" end="01:28:45.040" style="s2">have to look forward to but</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.040" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">for this for this election but we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.040" end="01:28:49.199" style="s2">a weird spot</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:51.679" style="s2">because the um</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.199" end="01:28:52.239" style="s2">because the left found that especially</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.679" end="01:28:55.600" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.239" end="01:28:58.719" style="s2">uh after kenosha</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.600" end="01:29:00.400" style="s2">rioting doesn&#39;t benefit you know the</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.719" end="01:29:02.080" style="s2">democratic party</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.400" end="01:29:03.840" style="s2">so they&#39;re going to have to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.080" end="01:29:06.880" style="s2">how to put a lid on their</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.840" end="01:29:09.920" style="s2">rioting until after the election a</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.880" end="01:29:11.520" style="s2">and and and b you know they may not even</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.920" end="01:29:13.040" style="s2">ride after the election because it does</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.520" end="01:29:14.880" style="s2">turn people off</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.040" end="01:29:16.800" style="s2">you know let&#39;s say it let&#39;s say it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.880" end="01:29:18.560" style="s2">grabs and we</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.800" end="01:29:22.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s after the election a few</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.560" end="01:29:22.400" style="s2">weeks later we still don&#39;t know who won</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.800" end="01:29:28.639" style="s2">pardon of my my my background here keep</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.000" end="01:29:29.360" style="s2">keeping it real we still don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.639" end="01:29:31.679" style="s2">won</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.360" end="01:29:33.120" style="s2">but you know so right now we&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.679" end="01:29:36.080" style="s2">in in the american public</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.120" end="01:29:36.880" style="s2">uh for for the legitimacy of of you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.080" end="01:29:39.920" style="s2">one of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.880" end="01:29:41.280" style="s2">of the two candidates well i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.920" end="01:29:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s going to benefit</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.280" end="01:29:46.480" style="s2">the democrats to have the whole united</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.880" end="01:29:49.920" style="s2">states convulsed</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.480" end="01:29:51.520" style="s2">in you know anti-trump riots</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.920" end="01:29:53.520" style="s2">after the election i don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.520" end="01:29:54.719" style="s2">going to benefit from that um</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.520" end="01:29:57.120" style="s2">so they&#39;re going to have to make</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.719" end="01:29:59.040" style="s2">adjustments to their political playbook</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.120" end="01:30:01.679" style="s2">and their in the strategic playbook</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.040" end="01:30:03.040" style="s2">uh considering that look i i mean on the</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.679" end="01:30:05.600" style="s2">other hand</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.040" end="01:30:06.080" style="s2">had it not been for this summer had it</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.600" end="01:30:08.159" style="s2">not been</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.080" end="01:30:09.760" style="s2">for seattle and portland and all this</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.159" end="01:30:11.840" style="s2">stuff i think it would be looking</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.760" end="01:30:13.360" style="s2">very different kind of strategy for the</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.840" end="01:30:14.239" style="s2">democrats in terms of the color</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.360" end="01:30:16.080" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.239" end="01:30:17.520" style="s2">i think you know i had the people not</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.080" end="01:30:20.159" style="s2">gotten sick of rioting</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.520" end="01:30:20.719" style="s2">there would have been you know that they</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.159" end="01:30:22.239" style="s2">would have been</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.719" end="01:30:25.280" style="s2">uh they would have been burning cities</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.239" end="01:30:26.719" style="s2">down in in in november and december but</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.280" end="01:30:28.880" style="s2">whether or not they do i think that</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.719" end="01:30:31.600" style="s2">still remains to be seen yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.880" end="01:30:33.199" style="s2">it does remain to be seen i i get the</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.600" end="01:30:35.360" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.199" end="01:30:37.440" style="s2">genie out of the bottle effect</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.360" end="01:30:38.800" style="s2">um i know that antiques i mean they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.440" end="01:30:41.120" style="s2">lost control</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.800" end="01:30:43.679" style="s2">yeah a little bit yeah uh i think that</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.120" end="01:30:45.040" style="s2">the the black lives matter and antifa i</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.679" end="01:30:46.880" style="s2">know for a fact that they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.040" end="01:30:49.280" style="s2">operational and doing things for many</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.880" end="01:30:51.639" style="s2">many years before just now</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.280" end="01:30:52.800" style="s2">and they&#39;ve been training and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.639" end="01:30:55.760" style="s2">indoctrinating</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.800" end="01:30:57.280" style="s2">and gearing up and and even they even</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.760" end="01:31:00.880" style="s2">took a little pause if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.280" end="01:31:04.159" style="s2">remember 2018 it seemed as though</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.880" end="01:31:06.239" style="s2">some of this stuff started to chill 2019</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.159" end="01:31:07.840" style="s2">start to chill a little bit but we kind</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.239" end="01:31:08.480" style="s2">of knew that they were just laying in</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.840" end="01:31:10.639" style="s2">weight</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.480" end="01:31:13.440" style="s2">and ready to come back in 2020 and here</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.639" end="01:31:16.400" style="s2">they are i suspect that uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.440" end="01:31:17.360" style="s2">if there will be an outburst november</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.400" end="01:31:20.080" style="s2">3rd</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.360" end="01:31:20.800" style="s2">there will be an outburst january</p>

<p begin="01:31:20.800" end="01:31:26.800" style="s2">when trump gets inaugurated again uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.920" end="01:31:28.080" style="s2">should he win hopefully uh and so i i</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.800" end="01:31:29.520" style="s2">think there&#39;s going to be a lot more of</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.080" end="01:31:31.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.520" end="01:31:33.440" style="s2">the thing that you brought up earlier</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.040" end="01:31:33.840" style="s2">that i see as a common thread in all of</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.440" end="01:31:36.159" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.840" end="01:31:38.159" style="s2">is you talked about information</p>

<p begin="01:31:38.159" end="01:31:43.840" style="s2">it&#39;s such a powerful uh and pervasive</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.920" end="01:31:46.000" style="s2">the information battle space the</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.840" end="01:31:47.840" style="s2">information landscape</p>

<p begin="01:31:47.840" end="01:31:51.199" style="s2">information operations what does it mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.159" end="01:31:54.480" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.199" end="01:31:57.199" style="s2">what can we expect to see over the next</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.480" end="01:31:58.159" style="s2">month two three months you know in terms</p>

<p begin="01:32:03.440" end="01:32:09.840" style="s2">what you think about that</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.159" end="01:32:12.159" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s a big topic but um</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.840" end="01:32:14.080" style="s2">and and people have been writing about</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.159" end="01:32:15.760" style="s2">this about this forever but</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.080" end="01:32:17.520" style="s2">the way i think about it is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.760" end="01:32:20.960" style="s2">simple um</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.520" end="01:32:22.320" style="s2">i think of information operation as</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.960" end="01:32:25.120" style="s2">you know when when you&#39;re in the world</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.320" end="01:32:26.960" style="s2">of politics you want to get a specific</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.120" end="01:32:28.800" style="s2">you want to get to a specific policy</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.960" end="01:32:30.960" style="s2">outcome</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.800" end="01:32:31.920" style="s2">and you say okay how am i going to get</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.960" end="01:32:34.480" style="s2">to this specific</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.920" end="01:32:35.040" style="s2">policy outcome i need to get people to</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.480" end="01:32:41.440" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.040" end="01:32:44.320" style="s2">x in order then to do why and</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.440" end="01:32:46.320" style="s2">since we&#39;re in politics and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.320" end="01:32:50.080" style="s2">sort of the nature of this world</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.320" end="01:32:53.280" style="s2">is is information these are the tools</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.080" end="01:32:54.080" style="s2">that we use in order to get you know in</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.280" end="01:32:56.639" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.080" end="01:32:57.199" style="s2">to to get the point across so for</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.639" end="01:32:59.520" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.199" end="01:33:00.800" style="s2">totally basic uh example actually this</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.520" end="01:33:04.320" style="s2">one is from um</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.800" end="01:33:08.560" style="s2">this one is from edward barnet um in</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.320" end="01:33:12.400" style="s2">probably in 1920 this example is from</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.560" end="01:33:15.600" style="s2">where he is approached by</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.400" end="01:33:16.560" style="s2">he is approached by a magazine and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.600" end="01:33:19.920" style="s2">magazine says</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.560" end="01:33:21.600" style="s2">we want more subscribers</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.920" end="01:33:24.719" style="s2">not only do we want more subscribers we</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.600" end="01:33:27.520" style="s2">want more important subscribers</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.719" end="01:33:29.440" style="s2">so this is okay so that&#39;s sort of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.520" end="01:33:30.880" style="s2">say the policy goal is more important</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.440" end="01:33:34.320" style="s2">subscribers</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.880" end="01:33:37.679" style="s2">so he says okay and uh he he will go</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.320" end="01:33:42.000" style="s2">and he</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.679" end="01:33:45.440" style="s2">puts together a an investigative piece</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.000" end="01:33:47.520" style="s2">in the magazine um that</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.440" end="01:33:49.920" style="s2">is you know provocative and</p>

<p begin="01:36:07.920" end="01:36:13.119" style="s2">which is in barney&#39;s case</p>

<p begin="01:36:16.719" end="01:36:19.760" style="s2">know i mean that was a</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.760" end="01:36:20.800" style="s2">perfect information if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.760" end="01:36:23.679" style="s2">it targeted</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.800" end="01:36:24.560" style="s2">because it was specifically targeted</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.679" end="01:36:26.800" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.560" end="01:36:28.400" style="s2">military voters where trump is strong</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.800" end="01:36:29.360" style="s2">they wanted to undermine the military</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.400" end="01:36:31.600" style="s2">voters</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.360" end="01:36:32.639" style="s2">i think because they wanted to push a</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.600" end="01:36:34.000" style="s2">coup</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.639" end="01:36:36.239" style="s2">point of view and they wanted to get</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.000" end="01:36:38.800" style="s2">they wanted to make it more likely for</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.239" end="01:36:40.239" style="s2">um for military leaders to to get</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.800" end="01:36:42.560" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.239" end="01:36:43.679" style="s2">um you know in order to eject trump but</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.560" end="01:36:47.119" style="s2">regardless</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.679" end="01:36:48.000" style="s2">they wanted to to to attack a part of</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.119" end="01:36:52.000" style="s2">trump&#39;s base</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.000" end="01:36:55.360" style="s2">so that&#39;s why they did the story so</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.000" end="01:36:56.639" style="s2">you know uh long story short that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.360" end="01:36:58.239" style="s2">an information operation</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.639" end="01:37:00.800" style="s2">is and you have your many component</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.239" end="01:37:05.119" style="s2">parts but basically it&#39;s just built by</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.800" end="01:37:08.320" style="s2">um by uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.119" end="01:37:08.800" style="s2">little shards and strands of information</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.320" end="01:37:11.679" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.800" end="01:37:13.360" style="s2">kind of put together in a in a um in a</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.679" end="01:37:16.520" style="s2">coherent way</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.360" end="01:37:19.840" style="s2">right and then a coordinated</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.520" end="01:37:20.880" style="s2">reinforcement doubling down uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.840" end="01:37:24.000" style="s2">persuasion</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.880" end="01:37:25.679" style="s2">through authority by getting popular</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.000" end="01:37:27.920" style="s2">people and authority figures and</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.679" end="01:37:30.960" style="s2">whatever to regurgitate them</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.920" end="01:37:33.040" style="s2">strategically leaking information</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.960" end="01:37:34.000" style="s2">so the reason why i wanted to bring this</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.040" end="01:37:36.400" style="s2">up is because for the</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.000" end="01:37:37.119" style="s2">listeners i just want people to</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.400" end="01:37:39.679" style="s2">challenge</p>

<p begin="01:37:56.639" end="01:38:00.000" style="s2">and then when you start to ask and this</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.320" end="01:38:00.800" style="s2">is how we started off the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.000" end="01:38:03.600" style="s2">why</p>

<p begin="01:38:08.239" end="01:38:14.239" style="s2">the manipulation and you start to sense</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.280" end="01:38:17.040" style="s2">a motivation coming at you rather than a</p>

<p begin="01:39:10.320" end="01:39:14.880" style="s2">and and it makes it feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.719" end="01:39:16.800" style="s2">taking a step through like fog and you</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.880" end="01:39:18.159" style="s2">don&#39;t know where the ground is and</p>

<p begin="01:39:33.920" end="01:39:37.280" style="s2">a very important point you brought up is</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.560" end="01:39:39.600" style="s2">is you know</p>

<p begin="01:39:39.600" end="01:39:41.840" style="s2">the question to ask why am i seeing this</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.199" end="01:39:45.040" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.840" end="01:39:46.960" style="s2">we have this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.040" end="01:39:48.159" style="s2">probably the most important thing that</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.960" end="01:39:51.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.159" end="01:39:52.960" style="s2">that in any of our viewers or listeners</p>

<p begin="01:40:26.960" end="01:40:33.679" style="s2">showed up with the narrative with</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.400" end="01:40:35.679" style="s2">four or five sources and the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.679" end="01:40:38.239" style="s2">that reporter has to do is maybe</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.679" end="01:40:40.480" style="s2">do a little typing you know maybe pull</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.239" end="01:40:44.159" style="s2">pull the story together</p>

<p begin="01:42:06.480" end="01:42:12.239" style="s2">on any given day with any given article</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.440" end="01:42:13.520" style="s2">is part of being able to decipher what</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.239" end="01:42:15.600" style="s2">is happening</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.520" end="01:42:16.800" style="s2">right so what we call this in the</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.600" end="01:42:20.080" style="s2">liminal order we call this</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.800" end="01:42:22.800" style="s2">sense making so we call it we we call</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.080" end="01:42:25.280" style="s2">sense making we define it as intentional</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.800" end="01:42:28.239" style="s2">understanding or intentional knowing</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.280" end="01:42:29.840" style="s2">so we like we concentrate it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.239" end="01:42:32.719" style="s2">personal sovereignty right</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.840" end="01:42:34.639" style="s2">is to develop a sense of sense making</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.719" end="01:42:36.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s an intentional understanding</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.639" end="01:42:38.400" style="s2">and intentional knowing</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.080" end="01:42:39.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s not being a passive receiver of</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.400" end="01:42:41.440" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.360" end="01:42:43.119" style="s2">it&#39;s being critical at all times asking</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.440" end="01:42:45.520" style="s2">yourself the motivations of the person</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.119" end="01:42:49.199" style="s2">delivering it the timing of it</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.520" end="01:42:53.119" style="s2">and trying to really come up with a a a</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.199" end="01:42:55.280" style="s2">strengthened muscle of sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.119" end="01:42:56.880" style="s2">so that you can maintain a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.280" end="01:42:59.040" style="s2">personal sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.880" end="01:43:01.360" style="s2">and maintain control of your own</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.040" end="01:43:03.600" style="s2">viewpoints and of your own emotions</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.360" end="01:43:04.960" style="s2">and to not have your passions be riled</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.600" end="01:43:07.280" style="s2">up uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.960" end="01:43:08.400" style="s2">undes you know unwillingly you know by</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.280" end="01:43:11.520" style="s2">somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.400" end="01:43:14.239" style="s2">and so uh in in today&#39;s environment</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.520" end="01:43:16.080" style="s2">and moving forward i can&#39;t see any way</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.239" end="01:43:20.000" style="s2">that this is going to diminish</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.080" end="01:43:22.159" style="s2">but developing a sense of sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.000" end="01:43:23.280" style="s2">as an essential component to personal</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.159" end="01:43:25.600" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.280" end="01:43:26.960" style="s2">is a skill that we all need to learn and</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.600" end="01:43:28.400" style="s2">it needs to go</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.960" end="01:43:29.840" style="s2">it needs to go way beyond what they</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.400" end="01:43:31.840" style="s2">teach in high schools where they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.840" end="01:43:33.040" style="s2">oh you can&#39;t use wikipedia as a source</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.840" end="01:43:36.639" style="s2">has to go</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.040" end="01:43:38.719" style="s2">way beyond that uh and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.639" end="01:43:40.320" style="s2">it is like we said it&#39;s intentional</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.719" end="01:43:41.920" style="s2">understanding intentional knowing</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.320" end="01:43:44.480" style="s2">you have to also be intentional in</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.920" end="01:43:46.159" style="s2">practicing and developing this skill</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.480" end="01:43:47.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that we work on</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.159" end="01:43:50.159" style="s2">every day in the liminal order we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.920" end="01:43:51.040" style="s2">sense making workshops and sense making</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.159" end="01:43:53.440" style="s2">seminars</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.040" end="01:43:54.800" style="s2">and we operate collectively as like an</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.440" end="01:43:56.880" style="s2">info militia</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.800" end="01:43:58.880" style="s2">and when i say info militia i mean this</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.880" end="01:44:00.960" style="s2">in the sense that a militia arises when</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.880" end="01:44:03.520" style="s2">the government fails to provide</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.960" end="01:44:04.480" style="s2">necessary security and in this case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.520" end="01:44:06.719" style="s2">an information</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.480" end="01:44:08.480" style="s2">environment and so we are a group of</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.719" end="01:44:09.760" style="s2">people that have come together to make</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.480" end="01:44:12.239" style="s2">sense of the world</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.760" end="01:44:13.199" style="s2">and we are effectively an info militia</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.239" end="01:44:15.920" style="s2">in this sense</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.199" end="01:44:17.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically a nation even</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.920" end="01:44:20.000" style="s2">worldwide intelligence network that</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.840" end="01:44:21.840" style="s2">brings information together we digest it</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.000" end="01:44:24.400" style="s2">and synthesize it as a team</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.840" end="01:44:26.239" style="s2">and then we can have a a reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.400" end="01:44:27.679" style="s2">accurate world view</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.239" end="01:44:30.080" style="s2">and we found it to be tremendously</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.679" end="01:44:31.920" style="s2">powerful so i&#39;m hoping that this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.080" end="01:44:33.440" style="s2">sense making makes it out there into the</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.920" end="01:44:35.920" style="s2">world and that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.440" end="01:44:37.760" style="s2">a critical life skill it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.920" end="01:44:39.360" style="s2">balancing the checkbook man you got to</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.760" end="01:44:41.920" style="s2">be able to make sense</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.360" end="01:44:42.960" style="s2">to sensemake and how to intentionally</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.920" end="01:44:44.880" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.960" end="01:44:46.960" style="s2">the world rather than being a passive</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.880" end="01:44:51.199" style="s2">receiver of information which</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.960" end="01:44:52.960" style="s2">is more times than not a manipulated uh</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.199" end="01:44:53.840" style="s2">you know sort of information operation</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.960" end="01:44:56.159" style="s2">as you said uh</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.840" end="01:44:59.119" style="s2">as an aside a great book on this subject</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.159" end="01:45:02.400" style="s2">is trust me i&#39;m lying by ryan holiday</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.119" end="01:45:03.760" style="s2">uh that is a fantastic book it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.400" end="01:45:06.960" style="s2">easy read</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.760" end="01:45:08.719" style="s2">he&#39;s funny and he lays it all out on how</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.960" end="01:45:09.840" style="s2">these information things happen all the</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.719" end="01:45:12.719" style="s2">news cycles happen</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.840" end="01:45:13.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve adopted a few of the tactics that</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.719" end="01:45:16.080" style="s2">he outlined</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.840" end="01:45:17.440" style="s2">in that book as well and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.080" end="01:45:20.159" style="s2">powerful stuff man</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.440" end="01:45:20.719" style="s2">it&#39;s powerful i love that book i gave i</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.159" end="01:45:23.679" style="s2">gave away</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.719" end="01:45:24.480" style="s2">several copies of that book um when when</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.679" end="01:45:28.000" style="s2">it first came out</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.480" end="01:45:30.080" style="s2">and when i first read it um i</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.000" end="01:45:31.119" style="s2">his you know his sections on andrew</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.080" end="01:45:34.320" style="s2">breitbart</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.119" end="01:45:36.719" style="s2">i think are unfair um you know i mean</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.320" end="01:45:38.480" style="s2">i knew him then so i was in a position</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.719" end="01:45:39.760" style="s2">i&#39;m in a position to kind of refute some</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.480" end="01:45:42.639" style="s2">of those uh</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.760" end="01:45:43.280" style="s2">some of those those barbs but uh but</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.639" end="01:45:46.159" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.280" end="01:45:47.440" style="s2">you&#39;re totally right about about that</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.159" end="01:45:52.239" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.440" end="01:45:55.040" style="s2">i also think that that book is</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.239" end="01:45:58.480" style="s2">the advice he gives is not really</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.040" end="01:46:00.960" style="s2">possible for someone on the right</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.480" end="01:46:02.159" style="s2">um in many ways because it takes for</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.960" end="01:46:05.360" style="s2">granted</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.159" end="01:46:07.199" style="s2">that you you know it takes for granted</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.360" end="01:46:09.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re not in an adversarial</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.199" end="01:46:12.960" style="s2">position with the rest of the media</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.600" end="01:46:16.080" style="s2">right um and that and you have that as</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.960" end="01:46:19.360" style="s2">you know you have uh a will media</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.080" end="01:46:22.639" style="s2">ready to disseminate for you um so</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.360" end="01:46:24.880" style="s2">a great book would be how to hack</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.639" end="01:46:26.320" style="s2">you know the media for you know for for</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.880" end="01:46:27.920" style="s2">those of us on the right</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.320" end="01:46:29.360" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think anyone would want to</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.920" end="01:46:31.760" style="s2">give up their secrets</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.360" end="01:46:33.760" style="s2">right well uh say what you want about</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.760" end="01:46:35.679" style="s2">laura loomer but she has figured that</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.760" end="01:46:38.320" style="s2">out she&#39;s figured out how to hack the</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.679" end="01:46:40.960" style="s2">major media systems in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.320" end="01:46:42.080" style="s2">uh when she was silenced off of twitter</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.960" end="01:46:43.920" style="s2">and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.080" end="01:46:45.840" style="s2">uh but i also think that there is some</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.920" end="01:46:46.560" style="s2">semblance of this ecosystem that ryan</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.840" end="01:46:48.960" style="s2">talks about</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.560" end="01:46:49.840" style="s2">happening on the right um guys like</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.960" end="01:46:52.320" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.840" end="01:46:53.440" style="s2">and others sort of in my sort of</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.320" end="01:46:55.920" style="s2">latitude we</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.440" end="01:46:56.639" style="s2">we source stuff it gets out there in the</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.920" end="01:46:58.480" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.639" end="01:47:00.159" style="s2">and then by the afternoon the bigger</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.480" end="01:47:01.920" style="s2">accounts pick it up and then by the</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.159" end="01:47:03.920" style="s2">night time it&#39;s on tucker carlson</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.920" end="01:47:05.199" style="s2">and i&#39;ve seen this happen personally a</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.920" end="01:47:07.360" style="s2">number of times</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.199" end="01:47:09.199" style="s2">and uh one it just shows the tucker&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.360" end="01:47:11.040" style="s2">producers are following all of us and</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.199" end="01:47:11.920" style="s2">have their ear to the ground very very</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.040" end="01:47:13.360" style="s2">intently</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.920" end="01:47:15.600" style="s2">uh and two it just shows that there</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.360" end="01:47:16.400" style="s2">really is a media ecosystem where you</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.600" end="01:47:18.000" style="s2">can surface</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.400" end="01:47:21.199" style="s2">information and bubble stories and</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.000" end="01:47:23.280" style="s2">narrative up i know you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.199" end="01:47:24.400" style="s2">i know you know i know you know about</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.280" end="01:47:26.080" style="s2">some of this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.400" end="01:47:27.440" style="s2">uh you&#39;ve mentioned some of the subject</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.080" end="01:47:29.119" style="s2">matters that you&#39;ve been involved in</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.440" end="01:47:31.119" style="s2">throughout this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.119" end="01:47:33.280" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s fascinating to me just</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.119" end="01:47:34.560" style="s2">to see how it all works and how in some</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.280" end="01:47:36.320" style="s2">in many cases this is</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.560" end="01:47:37.760" style="s2">an emergent phenomenon it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.320" end="01:47:38.400" style="s2">top-down directed kind of thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.760" end="01:47:40.080" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.400" end="01:47:41.920" style="s2">we&#39;re all in the arena and we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.080" end="01:47:42.480" style="s2">it happen and the and the right things</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.920" end="01:47:45.440" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.480" end="01:47:47.520" style="s2">have a way of making themselves known</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.440" end="01:47:49.360" style="s2">and surfacing to the top and if you can</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.520" end="01:47:51.199" style="s2">be connected to the right nodes or</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.360" end="01:47:53.840" style="s2">become a node yourself</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.199" end="01:47:56.639" style="s2">then you become very powerful and we saw</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.840" end="01:47:58.719" style="s2">that really evolve in 2016</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.639" end="01:48:01.040" style="s2">uh with the sort of maga sphere on</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.719" end="01:48:03.199" style="s2">twitter and information space uh</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.040" end="01:48:04.080" style="s2">evolution then and back then you know a</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.199" end="01:48:07.119" style="s2">lot of us were</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.080" end="01:48:08.960" style="s2">uh neophytes and new to that game and</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.119" end="01:48:10.719" style="s2">this time around man this is our second</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.960" end="01:48:12.320" style="s2">is my second go around i know some other</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.719" end="01:48:13.199" style="s2">guys our second go round we&#39;re battle</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.320" end="01:48:15.199" style="s2">tested</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.199" end="01:48:17.199" style="s2">battle hardened been through us know</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.199" end="01:48:18.960" style="s2">what it looks like what it feels like</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.199" end="01:48:21.119" style="s2">and i think to some extent that gives us</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.960" end="01:48:24.159" style="s2">a slight advantage this time but</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.119" end="01:48:25.679" style="s2">um you know the information space is one</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.159" end="01:48:26.639" style="s2">that&#39;s polluted on purpose the</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.679" end="01:48:28.960" style="s2">journalists are</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.639" end="01:48:30.960" style="s2">are stupid on purpose they&#39;re poorly</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.960" end="01:48:33.199" style="s2">educated they&#39;re indoctrinated the obama</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.960" end="01:48:34.880" style="s2">administration very famously said</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.199" end="01:48:36.480" style="s2">that the reporters are stupid and</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.880" end="01:48:37.440" style="s2">they&#39;ll do what they have no life</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.480" end="01:48:38.960" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.440" end="01:48:40.480" style="s2">and they&#39;ll do they&#39;ll write anything</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.960" end="01:48:43.520" style="s2">that we say anything</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.480" end="01:48:45.119" style="s2">at any time and you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.520" end="01:48:46.159" style="s2">everybody in america doesn&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.119" end="01:48:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s mind-boggling</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.159" end="01:48:49.199" style="s2">but we&#39;ll continue to push continue to</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.400" end="01:48:51.520" style="s2">push it out</p>

<p begin="01:49:05.920" end="01:49:10.719" style="s2">manipulated and that&#39;s pretty much where</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.400" end="01:49:12.480" style="s2">we are right now which is sad so as we</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.719" end="01:49:13.199" style="s2">started the conversation we&#39;ll end it</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.480" end="01:49:16.480" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.199" end="01:49:17.040" style="s2">an urge to people to ask why always ask</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.480" end="01:49:18.800" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.040" end="01:49:20.400" style="s2">ask the motivations of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.800" end="01:49:22.719" style="s2">observing ask</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.400" end="01:49:25.040" style="s2">why this is happening it will make you a</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.719" end="01:49:26.960" style="s2">happier healthier person</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.040" end="01:49:28.719" style="s2">once you get past the existential dread</p>

<p begin="01:50:48.159" end="01:50:50.800" style="s2">longer makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.119" end="01:50:53.679" style="s2">then maybe another you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.800" end="01:50:56.880" style="s2">another one will make more sense and</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.679" end="01:50:59.360" style="s2">only if we hash out these things and in</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.880" end="01:51:01.199" style="s2">in a way that uh that we&#39;re not afraid</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.360" end="01:51:03.760" style="s2">to do in a way that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.199" end="01:51:05.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not intimidated we&#39;re not limited</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.760" end="01:51:08.400" style="s2">by our</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.040" end="01:51:08.400" style="s2">um you know</p>

<p begin="01:51:12.000" end="01:51:15.920" style="s2">and things that we&#39;re afraid to know</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.080" end="01:51:18.800" style="s2">only then can we can we really</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.920" end="01:51:21.040" style="s2">um you know go go forward and figure out</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.800" end="01:51:23.360" style="s2">how to solve some of these problems</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.040" end="01:51:25.199" style="s2">yeah one thing that comes to mind here</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.360" end="01:51:27.360" style="s2">as we&#39;re going to wrap this up is</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.199" end="01:51:29.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a great great way to end too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.360" end="01:51:32.400" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a challenging</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.280" end="01:51:34.159" style="s2">environment an unpredictable future one</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.400" end="01:51:37.760" style="s2">that potentially has conflict</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.159" end="01:51:40.719" style="s2">or disorder in it certainly has disorder</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.760" end="01:51:42.960" style="s2">and then you talk about needing to take</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.719" end="01:51:44.880" style="s2">up make a personal decision</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.960" end="01:51:46.239" style="s2">to ask yourself why and to ask what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.880" end="01:51:48.800" style="s2">going to happen and</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.239" end="01:51:50.639" style="s2">at the core of it if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.800" end="01:51:53.199" style="s2">break it all the way all the way down</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.639" end="01:51:54.639" style="s2">you have to be a strong person you have</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.199" end="01:51:56.639" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.639" end="01:51:57.840" style="s2">integrity and i don&#39;t mean like</p>

<p begin="01:51:57.840" end="01:52:00.880" style="s2">as much as just like personal integrity</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.400" end="01:52:02.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.880" end="01:52:04.239" style="s2">i&#39;m going to tie this together for you</p>

<p begin="01:52:04.239" end="01:52:08.080" style="s2">strong and i don&#39;t just mean a mind of</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.040" end="01:52:10.880" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.080" end="01:52:12.239" style="s2">right so like guys a lot of my guy my</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.880" end="01:52:13.760" style="s2">audience are men we&#39;re interested in</p>

<p begin="01:52:13.760" end="01:52:17.599" style="s2">and personal sovereignty start with</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.400" end="01:52:19.520" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.599" end="01:52:21.760" style="s2">start with your body start with your</p>

<p begin="01:52:25.440" end="01:52:29.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.400" end="01:52:30.320" style="s2">an exaggeration man it&#39;s like a simple</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.360" end="01:52:32.960" style="s2">guide it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.320" end="01:52:34.400" style="s2">start with your personal strength squats</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.960" end="01:52:36.800" style="s2">are a great way to start</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.400" end="01:52:38.719" style="s2">start with your squats to save the world</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.800" end="01:52:41.199" style="s2">and it will be through that that we can</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.719" end="01:52:43.360" style="s2">develop in personal integrity of</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.199" end="01:52:44.480" style="s2">self so that we can be strong</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.360" end="01:52:46.800" style="s2">sensemakers</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.480" end="01:52:48.480" style="s2">so we can have personal sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.800" end="01:52:51.360" style="s2">which will hopefully then in turn</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.480" end="01:52:53.119" style="s2">lead to a national sovereignty that we</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.360" end="01:52:55.280" style="s2">can live with and appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.119" end="01:52:57.920" style="s2">and that can be respected by other</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.280" end="01:53:00.400" style="s2">nations and we can respect theirs</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.920" end="01:53:01.920" style="s2">as well and so i like to tie it all</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.400" end="01:53:03.520" style="s2">together it really is</p>
