<p begin="00:07:35.259" end="00:07:40.839" style="s2">something that actually gets people</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.240" end="00:07:42.639" style="s2">closer to their version of religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.839" end="00:07:44.499" style="s2">their version of whatever it ignites</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.639" end="00:07:45.879" style="s2">their soul and helps them feel closer</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.499" end="00:07:47.529" style="s2">and that is one of the questions I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:10.090" style="s2">don&#39;t need to dictate to anybody when</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.510" end="00:08:15.300" style="s2">you should feel closer to source to God</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.090" end="00:08:18.190" style="s2">at the universe I we could facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.300" end="00:08:20.260" style="s2">helping people find that I told this</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.190" end="00:08:22.120" style="s2">story a few times but when I was on back</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.590" end="00:09:03.520" style="s2">garden we were repeating what was sung</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.660" end="00:09:05.589" style="s2">and we were walking around and it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.520" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">just this way this is one this is church</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.660" end="00:11:21.340" style="s2">most time you could go without eating</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.550" end="00:11:25.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s from sunup to sundown and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.340" end="00:11:26.900" style="s2">more time after that anyway but what is</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.990" end="00:11:43.550" style="s2">that and help her through her her moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:45.740" style="s2">of crisis and she couldn&#39;t find it and I</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.020" end="00:12:25.950" style="s2">variables that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.440" end="00:12:27.840" style="s2">um make a church feel like home or make</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.950" end="00:12:30.150" style="s2">a church feel like it resonates with you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.840" end="00:12:31.950" style="s2">for me it&#39;s funny because I keep going</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.390" end="00:12:40.050" style="s2">different song so it&#39;s never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.860" end="00:12:43.830" style="s2">really resonate there&#39;s like a couple</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.050" end="00:12:46.680" style="s2">that are sung more commonly throughout</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.830" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">the churches but very few most of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.680" end="00:12:50.940" style="s2">were very specific to that church it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">like the minister&#39;s wife wrote them or</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.940" end="00:12:55.650" style="s2">something along those lines so I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.650" end="00:12:59.490" style="s2">want to just go sing about God I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.330" end="00:13:04.260" style="s2">to hear the songs that I say as a child</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.490" end="00:13:06.690" style="s2">but God and finding and then this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.260" end="00:13:08.970" style="s2">just gonna become time I more recently</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.690" end="00:13:12.120" style="s2">with my child feeling like I was missing</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.970" end="00:13:14.220" style="s2">out on not the church because I never</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.120" end="00:13:15.620" style="s2">wanted to go back to the church but like</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.220" end="00:13:17.850" style="s2">that community an intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.620" end="00:13:19.740" style="s2">community that I was participating as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.850" end="00:13:22.890" style="s2">kid that I got a lot out of even if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.740" end="00:13:27.110" style="s2">also paid a lot of price for it that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.890" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">wanted that and so I went to the United</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.170" end="00:13:41.520" style="s2">really resonates with me but the actual</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.970" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">service I was like this is boring like</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.520" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">this guy isn&#39;t preparing it like it&#39;s I</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.640" end="00:14:19.940" style="s2">all honesty but there&#39;s also so more</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.700" end="00:14:22.200" style="s2">recently I learned about the Quakers</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.940" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">this woman on YouTube I came over her</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.200" end="00:14:28.140" style="s2">name Jessica I don&#39;t remember and she</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:29.670" style="s2">has a wife and then a nice name is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.140" end="00:14:31.110" style="s2">our wives really attracted actually both</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.670" end="00:14:32.550" style="s2">really attractive just Jessica&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.110" end="00:14:34.050" style="s2">style not the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.550" end="00:14:36.390" style="s2">she was talked with hot she&#39;s a Quaker</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.050" end="00:14:38.790" style="s2">and talked about what a Quaker is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.390" end="00:14:40.650" style="s2">and her entire thing about I was like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.790" end="00:14:43.380" style="s2">how did I not know about this Quakers</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.650" end="00:14:45.930" style="s2">are I think they believed in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.380" end="00:14:48.090" style="s2">but they go to church and their church</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.930" end="00:14:50.520" style="s2">service they might call it something</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.090" end="00:14:52.470" style="s2">different is like the kids go off to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.520" end="00:14:54.900" style="s2">Sunday school and the adults stay in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.470" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">room and they like I think they walk</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.900" end="00:14:58.950" style="s2">around may be seated but walking around</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:00.600" style="s2">in silence until someone feels the need</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.950" end="00:15:01.830" style="s2">to speak and then they speak and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.600" end="00:15:03.030" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s related to the last</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.830" end="00:15:04.650" style="s2">person speaking you don&#39;t prepare</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.030" end="00:15:06.780" style="s2">something ahead of time it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.650" end="00:15:09.090" style="s2">moment and allowing it to return so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.780" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">basically like a group meditation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.090" end="00:15:16.770" style="s2">also this conversation that comes up</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.429" end="00:18:46.850" style="s2">that the majority of things work for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.470" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">work for other people you follow the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.850" end="00:18:49.789" style="s2">majority and if you&#39;re someone who like</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:51.950" style="s2">me and the majority of things don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.789" end="00:18:56.120" style="s2">for you you find your niche you find the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.950" end="00:18:58.370" style="s2">pieces that do work for you and like I</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.120" end="00:19:01.460" style="s2">don&#39;t need people who I&#39;m singing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.370" end="00:19:02.490" style="s2">nature with to believe every tenant that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.460" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">I believe in</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.490" end="00:19:07.050" style="s2">but chances about or next to zero I need</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">them to show up and want to sing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.050" end="00:19:13.050" style="s2">same songs together in the same location</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:15.900" style="s2">right so there&#39;s whereas of course if</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.050" end="00:19:17.670" style="s2">you&#39;re in a Catholic Church you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.900" end="00:19:20.250" style="s2">want everyone to follow the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.670" end="00:19:22.350" style="s2">religion and you&#39;re gonna want people to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.250" end="00:19:23.580" style="s2">be under under that but then how under</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:26.010" style="s2">that do you need to be you need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.580" end="00:19:27.870" style="s2">believe in a hundred percent a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.010" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">percent as deeply as everybody else or</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.870" end="00:19:32.520" style="s2">can you believe in ninety percent of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:34.110" style="s2">you believe an eighty percent of it but</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.520" end="00:19:36.390" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point where I&#39;m answering</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.110" end="00:19:37.770" style="s2">the metric so you want to move legend</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.390" end="00:19:38.820" style="s2">but that might be something that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.770" end="00:19:40.200" style="s2">care about right if you&#39;re Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.820" end="00:19:42.660" style="s2">you&#39;re raised Catholic you still</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.200" end="00:19:44.250" style="s2">identify as Catholic but you also only</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.660" end="00:19:46.680" style="s2">ninety percent resonate with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.250" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">which church works for you which one</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.680" end="00:19:53.370" style="s2">actually would would follow um would you</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.370" end="00:19:57.150" style="s2">talking about two different platforms</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:59.790" style="s2">one of which is find your worshiping</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.150" end="00:20:02.310" style="s2">Center find your community which comes</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.950" end="00:20:08.550" style="s2">Catholic under the religion umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.080" end="00:20:11.090" style="s2">your people also might be your</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.550" end="00:20:13.730" style="s2">profession and your everything else</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.090" end="00:20:20.010" style="s2">every other category that were part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.730" end="00:20:22.740" style="s2">but finding helping people find their</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.010" end="00:20:28.440" style="s2">place of worship also helps them unfine</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.740" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">it if you feel so tied to your by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.440" end="00:20:32.190" style="s2">way I&#39;m paralyzed is interrupting me at</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:33.690" style="s2">this exact moment time but if you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.190" end="00:20:35.700" style="s2">to join me on camera and answer these</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.690" end="00:20:37.950" style="s2">questions or talk about your religious</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.700" end="00:20:42.920" style="s2">experience how you find it found your</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.950" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">religion unique amongst amongst the many</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.920" end="00:20:46.290" style="s2">born into it so is just less interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:49.680" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t really have to fight</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.290" end="00:20:51.720" style="s2">for it but what what did what drew you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.680" end="00:20:55.380" style="s2">in and where you find especially where</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.720" end="00:20:57.750" style="s2">what ignites your heart and soul which</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.380" end="00:20:59.430" style="s2">my own personal issue the shadow side</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.750" end="00:21:02.910" style="s2">I&#39;m not really interested in hearing</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.430" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">about I found God and God is the answer</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.910" end="00:21:05.490" style="s2">to everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:07.590" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in why God&#39;s the answer</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.490" end="00:21:08.940" style="s2">and everything for you but God is an SL</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.590" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">the answer to everything everything for</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.940" end="00:21:13.830" style="s2">everyone and that is to me what if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:15.539" style="s2">gonna find a common religion if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.830" end="00:21:16.859" style="s2">going to be able to get along with</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.539" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">different religions because no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.859" end="00:21:20.759" style="s2">ever gonna be a burn unless we murder</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:22.739" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s not we&#39;re never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.759" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">have everyone be Christian everyone be</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.739" end="00:21:26.879" style="s2">Muslim everyone be seek and so how we</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:31.080" style="s2">get along on this planet well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.879" end="00:21:32.879" style="s2">different is a big part of like to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.080" end="00:21:35.460" style="s2">choose your own you choose which one</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.879" end="00:21:37.580" style="s2">resonates with you including none of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.460" end="00:21:40.859" style="s2">above right including all of the above</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.580" end="00:21:42.450" style="s2">that to me my religion is picking and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.859" end="00:21:44.519" style="s2">choosing it&#39;s picking and choosing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.450" end="00:21:47.820" style="s2">practices and the people and the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.519" end="00:21:51.539" style="s2">that I like none of the religions but</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.820" end="00:21:53.669" style="s2">out of a lot of B M C cultural practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.539" end="00:21:56.849" style="s2">my religions cultural appropriation it</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.669" end="00:22:00.479" style="s2">turns out but no it&#39;s not it&#39;s a but</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.849" end="00:22:03.419" style="s2">yeah I mean I I if something resonates</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.479" end="00:22:06.059" style="s2">deep down but Society says not to do it</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.419" end="00:22:08.399" style="s2">I listen more to my inner soul than I do</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.059" end="00:22:10.950" style="s2">to society and so part of that is actual</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.399" end="00:22:13.769" style="s2">culture appropriation it&#39;s like me and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.950" end="00:22:15.059" style="s2">my god tell me I was to use it but this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.769" end="00:22:16.379" style="s2">group of people say I&#39;m not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.059" end="00:22:17.820" style="s2">use it who do I listen to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.379" end="00:22:25.619" style="s2">who has the right who doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.820" end="00:22:27.179" style="s2">right that&#39;s its own like um a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.619" end="00:22:30.629" style="s2">people and I understand and I even</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.179" end="00:22:35.009" style="s2">slightly agree and yet don&#39;t agree well</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.629" end="00:22:38.009" style="s2">my life explained is that like part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.009" end="00:22:41.129" style="s2">the reason people cling to like African</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.009" end="00:22:42.509" style="s2">American culture especially or First</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.129" end="00:22:43.320" style="s2">Nations culture is they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.509" end="00:22:45.960" style="s2">have one of their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.320" end="00:22:47.700" style="s2">and so the key is to go back to your own</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.960" end="00:22:50.789" style="s2">heritage and look at what you what your</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.700" end="00:22:52.590" style="s2">people did and like for my people like</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.789" end="00:22:54.239" style="s2">you know many people are in me which one</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.590" end="00:22:55.529" style="s2">do I get to pick and choose now can I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.239" end="00:22:57.389" style="s2">choose first nation with seven minute</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.529" end="00:22:59.190" style="s2">I&#39;m head up a bit of Cherokee</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.389" end="00:23:00.570" style="s2">can I pick Judaism in fact I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.190" end="00:23:02.220" style="s2">nothing about it cuz I&#39;ve one Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.570" end="00:23:03.690" style="s2">grandparent like yeah I&#39;m allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.220" end="00:23:05.519" style="s2">pick those but I&#39;m not allowed to pick</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.690" end="00:23:07.859" style="s2">African because that one actually like</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.519" end="00:23:11.399" style="s2">the continent Africa resonates with me</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.859" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s a little what which one am I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.399" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">allowed to which one am I not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.289" style="s2">which what am I allowed to do and not</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:18.570" style="s2">allowed to do and to me it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.289" end="00:23:20.999" style="s2">does it resonate with me like I love</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.570" end="00:23:24.210" style="s2">yoga yoga feels good for my body and my</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.999" end="00:23:25.499" style="s2">soul and so I do it um luckily it comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.210" end="00:23:28.049" style="s2">from one of the cultures that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.499" end="00:23:29.400" style="s2">is kind of pro cultures like yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.049" end="00:23:32.070" style="s2">works for you use it but not</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.400" end="00:23:34.620" style="s2">everyone there feels that way he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.070" end="00:23:36.330" style="s2">take a poll it&#39;s not everyone but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.620" end="00:23:38.070" style="s2">wasn&#39;t using sponging because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.330" end="00:23:40.140" style="s2">believe in it until someone introduced</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.070" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">me to it and now I smudge it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.140" end="00:23:43.590" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the key to me do I</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:46.290" style="s2">believe in it do I think it&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.590" end="00:23:48.150" style="s2">because if I believe yoga works which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.290" end="00:23:50.340" style="s2">why I don&#39;t think it belongs to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.150" end="00:23:51.750" style="s2">certain group of people if it makes your</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.340" end="00:23:53.490" style="s2">body feel better if it connects you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.750" end="00:23:56.130" style="s2">the earth it works</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.490" end="00:23:57.540" style="s2">like what whereas I didn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.130" end="00:24:01.800" style="s2">smudging until I did and then it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.540" end="00:24:05.160" style="s2">like well if it kills bad bacteria if it</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.800" end="00:24:06.510" style="s2">actually cleanses a space then who&#39;s who</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.160" end="00:24:08.460" style="s2">gets that and who doesn&#39;t get that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.510" end="00:24:10.650" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s whatever that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.460" end="00:24:11.880" style="s2">own my own issue of like well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.650" end="00:24:13.860" style="s2">want to go back and learn my Celtic</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.880" end="00:24:16.320" style="s2">roots I don&#39;t that&#39;s not what connects</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.860" end="00:24:18.900" style="s2">me that&#39;s not what I feel drawn to and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.320" end="00:24:20.760" style="s2">in fact I feel anti drawn to anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.900" end="00:24:22.410" style="s2">that&#39;s around a central figure I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.760" end="00:24:27.380" style="s2">care how awesome that central figure is</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.410" end="00:24:29.670" style="s2">and all tribal that I know of have</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.380" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">hierarchical central figures have even</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.670" end="00:24:34.620" style="s2">if they&#39;re less close anyway no point</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:35.610" style="s2">building our own religion and how</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.620" end="00:24:38.040" style="s2">talking about two different platforms</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.610" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">that are coming up in my head is one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.040" end="00:24:43.110" style="s2">which is find your congregation find</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:44.660" style="s2">your place of worship and it can be an a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.110" end="00:24:47.460" style="s2">single event it can be things like</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.660" end="00:24:49.290" style="s2">singing in nature who do you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.460" end="00:24:51.570" style="s2">to be included maybe they&#39;re singing</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.290" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">hymn in a song therefore I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.570" end="00:24:56.340" style="s2">want to go maybe it&#39;s more call and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:57.720" style="s2">respond like Woodward singers and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.340" end="00:25:01.200" style="s2">sometimes that resonates with me and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.720" end="00:25:03.540" style="s2">sometimes it doesn&#39;t and so finding your</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.200" end="00:25:04.650" style="s2">place and the other thing is literally a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.540" end="00:25:07.650" style="s2">site that can help you build your own</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.650" end="00:25:10.200" style="s2">religion like if we think more about a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.650" end="00:25:12.210" style="s2">site that it guess helps you on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.200" end="00:25:15.720" style="s2">journey to happiness</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.210" end="00:25:18.900" style="s2">so which in and of itself is kind of its</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.720" end="00:25:20.820" style="s2">own religion but not again there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.900" end="00:25:24.030" style="s2">central figure there is no like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.820" end="00:25:25.920" style="s2">what I look up just do that now since</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.030" end="00:25:28.560" style="s2">owens joining me looking up like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.920" end="00:25:31.380" style="s2">what it is to be a cult and if we can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.560" end="00:25:33.690" style="s2">the opposite of that exact opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.380" end="00:25:35.460" style="s2">what it is to be a cult and which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.690" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">basically like everyone on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.460" end="00:25:39.500" style="s2">is bad and we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:41.910" style="s2">no everyone&#39;s worthy everyone is worthy</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.500" end="00:25:42.419" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t I don&#39;t get to decide</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.910" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">on your word</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.419" end="00:25:47.820" style="s2">it&#39;s already been decided you&#39;re worthy</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.220" end="00:25:49.409" style="s2">and so you&#39;re not living by my standards</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.820" end="00:25:51.090" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make you less worthy me not</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.409" end="00:25:52.769" style="s2">love you by my own standards I can</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.090" end="00:25:54.950" style="s2">decide my own self-worth is maybe less</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.769" end="00:26:00.029" style="s2">than even if that&#39;s not the truth but</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.950" end="00:26:02.700" style="s2">finding a way to answer these questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.029" end="00:26:05.009" style="s2">or any questions that do resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.700" end="00:26:06.869" style="s2">with a broader group of people I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.009" end="00:26:10.440" style="s2">like how you found God is not only it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.869" end="00:26:12.239" style="s2">not on this list right it&#39;s because even</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.440" end="00:26:13.710" style="s2">that word even the word God when I use</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.239" end="00:26:15.389" style="s2">it I don&#39;t use that word because it</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.710" end="00:26:18.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t resonate well with me I use the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.389" end="00:26:21.029" style="s2">word universe and more recently at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.330" end="00:26:22.919" style="s2">on this last source it is the source of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.029" end="00:26:26.070" style="s2">everything what do you call it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.919" end="00:26:27.629" style="s2">know but I think of God is the person in</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.070" end="00:26:30.989" style="s2">the Old and New Testament and it does</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.629" end="00:26:34.529" style="s2">not resonate with me but finding a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.989" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">to create your meaning in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.529" end="00:26:38.249" style="s2">your access to happiness whether you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.350" style="s2">want to call that a religion or not</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.249" end="00:26:43.139" style="s2">because again more religion clearly has</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.350" end="00:26:45.419" style="s2">got a date with people but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.139" end="00:26:47.820" style="s2">find tools and practices to help you</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.419" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">figure out who you are at a deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.820" end="00:26:51.570" style="s2">deeper level or more surface and more</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:53.129" style="s2">surface level I mean part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.570" end="00:26:56.100" style="s2">were talking about yesterday was how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.129" end="00:26:59.100" style="s2">explore that and talking about like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.100" end="00:27:01.619" style="s2">fun questions to ask that are less Who</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.100" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">am I is a pretty serious profound</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.619" end="00:27:06.809" style="s2">question whereas like if I was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:09.210" style="s2">vegetable which vegetable would I be is</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.809" end="00:27:10.249" style="s2">fun and playful and not it tells you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.210" end="00:27:12.419" style="s2">lot about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.249" end="00:27:16.499" style="s2">possibly and other people a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.419" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">you but it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s fun it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.499" end="00:27:21.269" style="s2">deep and and hardcore as like who am i</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:23.340" style="s2">but really that is the question you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.269" end="00:27:24.989" style="s2">answering and so finding fun ways to</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.340" end="00:27:25.830" style="s2">play with like how do you want to answer</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.989" end="00:27:27.269" style="s2">Who am I</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.399" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">what does that mean what does that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.169" end="00:29:17.340" style="s2">actually mean when I am is a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:19.139" style="s2">or Muslim and it&#39;s under this umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.340" end="00:29:21.240" style="s2">and I&#39;m only okay with people that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.139" end="00:29:22.970" style="s2">like that that can be the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.240" end="00:29:26.070" style="s2">those questions and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.970" end="00:29:27.510" style="s2">particularly wrong with that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.070" end="00:29:29.940" style="s2">if you&#39;re stopping other people right</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.510" end="00:29:32.909" style="s2">like and that to me is how I started off</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.940" end="00:29:35.250" style="s2">this conversation is that to me part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.909" end="00:29:37.019" style="s2">the drawback the drawback of most</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.250" end="00:29:39.809" style="s2">religions is that they need to be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.019" end="00:29:42.269" style="s2">only religion there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.809" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">having a belief system that you follow</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.269" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">that enhances your life and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:50.490" style="s2">helps your family in your community but</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:54.570" style="s2">either as an invitation or an imposition</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.490" end="00:29:56.010" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work - if you&#39;re not this</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.570" end="00:29:57.059" style="s2">you&#39;re going to hell if you&#39;re not this</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.059" end="00:30:02.760" style="s2">this you&#39;re not and so finding a way</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.630" end="00:30:04.169" style="s2">that is Invitational to every individual</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.760" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">regardless so they&#39;re part of one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.169" end="00:30:07.409" style="s2">those religions or they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:10.940" style="s2">religion or their spiritual or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.409" end="00:30:17.190" style="s2">not spiritual what</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.940" end="00:30:20.850" style="s2">phil&#39;s the same role that religion used</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.190" end="00:30:22.560" style="s2">to in does fill without the negative</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.850" end="00:30:25.980" style="s2">side and to me the negative side is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.560" end="00:30:28.110" style="s2">quant the need for others to conform and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.980" end="00:30:30.660" style="s2">therefore if we can figure out how do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.110" end="00:30:34.560" style="s2">don&#39;t need others to conform to our to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.660" end="00:30:37.230" style="s2">our way that is the central tenets</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.560" end="00:30:38.760" style="s2">but then the I read because of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.230" end="00:30:44.370" style="s2">holding that that it becomes its central</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.760" end="00:30:46.710" style="s2">tenant and whatever self connection that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.370" end="00:30:49.320" style="s2">if we can help people like part of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.710" end="00:30:50.820" style="s2">religion is is a sign a set of of how</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.320" end="00:30:53.160" style="s2">you can guidelines on how to live your</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.820" end="00:30:55.470" style="s2">life that we then we can agree on and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.160" end="00:30:58.050" style="s2">then we impose on everybody else there</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.470" end="00:30:59.880" style="s2">inquisitions and violence and he needs</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.880" end="00:31:05.150" style="s2">religion that has not invoked violence</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.130" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2">on a massive scale I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.150" end="00:31:09.990" style="s2">finding but that wasn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:12.770" style="s2">individuals right the individual stone</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:15.150" style="s2">but the overarching thank you</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.150" end="00:31:23.340" style="s2">or you convert finding path that is all</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.950" end="00:31:26.190" style="s2">of ours that is common between them that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.340" end="00:31:29.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require central tenants to to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.190" end="00:31:31.560" style="s2">involved because this is and this is my</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.430" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">issue with with all religions and I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.560" end="00:31:37.620" style="s2">had this conversation with my stepdad</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.809" end="00:34:33.039" style="s2">four now five questions is to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.240" end="00:34:34.569" style="s2">these choose your own religion because</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.039" end="00:34:36.820" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in there that says you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.569" end="00:34:40.690" style="s2">can&#39;t do that with with God</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.820" end="00:34:42.610" style="s2">and whatever your God is or by yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.690" end="00:34:44.020" style="s2">it&#39;s only the individual right if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.610" end="00:34:45.400" style="s2">like well no no no no no I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.020" end="00:34:46.900" style="s2">possibly do that unless it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.400" end="00:34:48.670" style="s2">Christians doing that I can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.900" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">do that unless it&#39;s only Hindus doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.670" end="00:34:55.360" style="s2">that then that&#39;s definitely within you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:35:00.570" style="s2">that issue arose other Hindus other</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.360" end="00:35:00.570" style="s2">Christians other atheists and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.840" end="00:35:04.570" style="s2">pastafarians can&#39;t all have looked for</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.580" end="00:35:07.170" style="s2">the word because they can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.570" end="00:35:09.880" style="s2">what the Flying Spaghetti Monster</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.170" end="00:35:15.250" style="s2">congregation is called the individuals</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.250" end="00:35:18.820" style="s2">commonality that can bring us together</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.320" end="00:35:21.730" style="s2">and answer these questions because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.820" end="00:35:26.620" style="s2">also like I could be in a group of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.730" end="00:35:28.150" style="s2">people with with people that that call</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.620" end="00:35:29.650" style="s2">themselves different religions right I</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.150" end="00:35:31.930" style="s2">have no problem being in a group of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.650" end="00:35:35.590" style="s2">people who are Hindu and Muslim and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.930" end="00:35:37.420" style="s2">Christian and even Scientologists who if</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.590" end="00:35:39.780" style="s2">they&#39;re truly there to answer these</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.420" end="00:35:41.800" style="s2">questions for themselves and not</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.780" end="00:35:44.040" style="s2">inflicting like the only way you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.800" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">know who you are is through God by God</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.040" end="00:35:48.130" style="s2">the only way you can find your people is</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:49.810" style="s2">at church on Sunday because they all</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.130" end="00:35:51.670" style="s2">found God and that is the only way and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.810" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">why would you start people they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.670" end="00:35:55.690" style="s2">be in heaven with you after because none</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:58.900" style="s2">of that has been proven to me and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.690" end="00:36:00.490" style="s2">is kind of the point it&#39;s like if it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.900" end="00:36:02.620" style="s2">can&#39;t be disproven to you it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.490" end="00:36:09.130" style="s2">proven to me and it can&#39;t be disproved</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.620" end="00:36:11.650" style="s2">like yeah this is the who am i who and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.130" end="00:36:13.690" style="s2">where are my people what is my purpose</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.650" end="00:36:19.210" style="s2">what do I need and what am I ready to</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.690" end="00:36:22.050" style="s2">let go of and what I&#39;m trying to was</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.210" end="00:36:24.280" style="s2">trying to look up before this this and</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.050" end="00:36:27.700" style="s2">did not succeed in is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.280" end="00:36:29.890" style="s2">documentary called happy and in it they</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.700" end="00:36:33.940" style="s2">go through and there&#39;s also a course</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.890" end="00:36:36.310" style="s2">because I want to look at the course in</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.940" end="00:36:38.230" style="s2">what makes people happy and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.310" end="00:36:39.370" style="s2">actually the list I think of what makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.230" end="00:36:40.690" style="s2">people happy although I wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.370" end="00:36:43.270" style="s2">find the list that I had wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.690" end="00:36:45.550" style="s2">correlate the two or see if it includes</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.270" end="00:36:47.350" style="s2">everything on it but it&#39;s do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.550" end="00:36:50.340" style="s2">sense of purpose do you feel like what</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.350" end="00:36:52.980" style="s2">you do matters do you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.340" end="00:36:54.900" style="s2">people in your life who know you and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.980" end="00:36:57.360" style="s2">like you do you have connection and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.900" end="00:36:58.620" style="s2">community do you know who you are and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.360" end="00:37:02.760" style="s2">feel like you matter and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.620" end="00:37:04.110" style="s2">important and then there is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.760" end="00:37:05.940" style="s2">routes to your basic needs being met</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.110" end="00:37:07.050" style="s2">right it&#39;s kind of hard to be overall</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.940" end="00:37:09.030" style="s2">happy if you don&#39;t have food on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.050" end="00:37:10.200" style="s2">table if your friends and family are</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.030" end="00:37:12.660" style="s2">dying from diseases that are preventable</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.200" end="00:37:15.870" style="s2">and curable and you don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.660" end="00:37:18.620" style="s2">health care it&#39;s hard to be happy so</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.870" end="00:37:21.840" style="s2">like there is a bear I think it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.620" end="00:37:24.030" style="s2">America and probably Canada $60,000 a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.840" end="00:37:25.830" style="s2">year of which up to that point your</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.030" end="00:37:27.720" style="s2">happiness does increase and at that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.830" end="00:37:29.400" style="s2">point it does not increase because now</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.720" end="00:37:31.740" style="s2">you have your needs met and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.400" end="00:37:32.940" style="s2">stuff on top of that it&#39;s just feeling</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.740" end="00:37:34.830" style="s2">better than other people and really</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.940" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">better than other people is not on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.830" end="00:37:39.810" style="s2">list of things that make us happy so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:41.850" style="s2">guess if happiness is our religion true</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.810" end="00:37:44.280" style="s2">happiness not happiness that&#39;s forced in</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.850" end="00:37:46.740" style="s2">the moment because my my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.280" end="00:37:49.230" style="s2">happiness definitely yes but up and down</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.740" end="00:37:52.650" style="s2">process there&#39;s there&#39;s grief there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.230" end="00:37:56.280" style="s2">anger there&#39;s fear but overall there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.650" end="00:38:01.100" style="s2">sense of peace and purpose and love for</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.280" end="00:38:03.660" style="s2">myself and others and that is a like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.100" end="00:38:06.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a happiness and a joy there that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.660" end="00:38:09.960" style="s2">although not every moment is full of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.980" end="00:38:11.550" style="s2">it permeates every moment the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.960" end="00:38:13.050" style="s2">that it exists and even if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.550" end="00:38:14.610" style="s2">exist in this moment it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.050" end="00:38:16.620" style="s2">exist it&#39;s not holding on to it right</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.610" end="00:38:19.020" style="s2">holding on to happiness the word is way</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.620" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">to hold on to happiness because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.020" end="00:38:22.710" style="s2">just those things right it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:25.290" style="s2">momentary feeling it&#39;s am I connected to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.710" end="00:38:27.390" style="s2">people do I have purpose do I know who I</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.290" end="00:38:31.380" style="s2">am and feel like I am I&#39;m more the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.390" end="00:38:32.100" style="s2">individual and we again I can&#39;t hand it</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.840" end="00:38:45.330" style="s2">be but no one can actually receive that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.410" end="00:38:46.920" style="s2">until they&#39;re ready right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.330" end="00:38:48.030" style="s2">actually receive it from the inside it</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.920" end="00:38:50.340" style="s2">has to be something that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.030" end="00:38:54.210" style="s2">inside it&#39;s like oh look at me all</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.340" end="00:38:58.590" style="s2">worthy oh my I&#39;m as good as other repo</p>
