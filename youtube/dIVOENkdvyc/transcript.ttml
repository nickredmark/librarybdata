<p begin="00:00:57.790" end="00:01:03.700" style="s2">in something that I do called circling</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.790" end="00:01:05.619" style="s2">which is you could say is a a deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.700" end="00:01:08.170" style="s2">relational practice and presence and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.619" end="00:01:12.400" style="s2">being present in a relational way with</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.170" end="00:01:15.929" style="s2">people and basically have you know rich</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.400" end="00:01:18.850" style="s2">deep rewarding and even profound</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.929" end="00:01:21.460" style="s2">conversations such that both people are</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.460" end="00:01:25.929" style="s2">trainings with training people how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:28.149" style="s2">circle in circling the infinite there</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.929" end="00:01:31.210" style="s2">was a graphic wrist movement that is now</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.149" end="00:01:34.689" style="s2">all over the world and so when when are</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.210" end="00:01:36.819" style="s2">you and I and that&#39;s and we started</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.689" end="00:01:38.859" style="s2">connecting on what she does it as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.819" end="00:01:41.229" style="s2">therapist and what we&#39;re doing in circle</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.859" end="00:01:43.960" style="s2">sir courting she got really excited</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.229" end="00:01:48.719" style="s2">about the implications of that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.960" end="00:01:48.719" style="s2">actually a practice that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:52.899" style="s2">manifests it can be practiced on</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.829" end="00:01:55.060" style="s2">multiple different levels but</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.899" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">essentially that she she least saw that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.060" end="00:02:01.630" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of insights to be gleaned</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:04.869" style="s2">about circling through looking at an</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.630" end="00:02:06.759" style="s2">attachment lens and that&#39;s there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.869" end="00:02:08.770" style="s2">to be gleaned he was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.759" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">attachment through his circling lens and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.770" end="00:02:13.630" style="s2">how the two intersect and so she&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:16.720" style="s2">her imagination and her attention has</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.630" end="00:02:18.520" style="s2">been really correct by this you know so</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.720" end="00:02:20.650" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m excited that this interview and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.520" end="00:02:22.890" style="s2">and they have a conversation where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.650" end="00:02:27.629" style="s2">can begin to make connections together</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.890" end="00:02:27.629" style="s2">in the stuff that she&#39;s been working on</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.250" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2">yeah well I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.650" end="00:02:35.910" style="s2">context setting and I am so glad that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:37.560" style="s2">could just sit down for the last 15</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.910" end="00:02:40.320" style="s2">minutes I&#39;m here on the beach before I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.560" end="00:02:42.660" style="s2">go back home I&#39;ve been here in Baja for</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.320" end="00:02:45.960" style="s2">a week and I got to spend a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.660" end="00:02:47.220" style="s2">of time organizing this project that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.960" end="00:02:49.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working on wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.220" end="00:02:51.960" style="s2">interview you I guess it&#39;s a co</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.320" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">interviewer saying but for the last nine</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.960" end="00:02:57.750" style="s2">months and Josh too as they either</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:02:59.750" style="s2">introduced me to this book attachment</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">and psychotherapy by David Wallen and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.750" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">ever since he showed it to me I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:10.790" style="s2">fascinated by it you know I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">when I first had this idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.790" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">circling creates or offers the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:20.610" style="s2">experience of attachment of a secure</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">attachment I I just I saw it and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.610" end="00:03:24.870" style="s2">are certain ways things that I saw but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:26.670" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a lot of elaborations I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.870" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">it was more intuition it was a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.670" end="00:03:30.960" style="s2">there was a little bit of I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:34.380" style="s2">evidence definitely evidence but this</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.960" end="00:03:39.510" style="s2">book is described circling in so many</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.380" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">ways and it&#39;s really brought it showed</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.510" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">me how you know made me interested and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">how did circling evolve in the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">years to come to a lot of the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">conclusions that the field of attachment</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:56.340" style="s2">for adults has also come to the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">conclusions and for example what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:04:02.100" style="s2">understand is some of the edges that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">evolving right now are not from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.100" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">attachment field but rather they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:08.520" style="s2">drawing from other fields of interest</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">objectivity and relational theory and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.520" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">also Buddhism and I know that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">circling for example one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:20.370" style="s2">principles is how deeply can we be with</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">what is and so these ways that David</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.370" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">Wallen is you know describing all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:32.710" style="s2">different principles and aspects I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:35.470" style="s2">been waiting so long to try to organize</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.710" end="00:04:37.810" style="s2">the material to present it to you and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.470" end="00:04:39.639" style="s2">this is this today is just a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.810" end="00:04:41.169" style="s2">introduction to the interviews we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.639" end="00:04:43.210" style="s2">going to be doing because there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.169" end="00:04:45.370" style="s2">pretty complex terms that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.210" end="00:04:47.169" style="s2">understand better that I want to explore</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.370" end="00:04:48.850" style="s2">with you and I think that people would</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.169" end="00:04:50.350" style="s2">be really interested in some of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.850" end="00:04:57.310" style="s2">terms so I want to describe what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.350" end="00:05:01.030" style="s2">are and and so first of all I was Arif I</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.310" end="00:05:03.220" style="s2">that to the two audiences that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.030" end="00:05:06.190" style="s2">speaking to here are therapists because</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.220" end="00:05:07.870" style="s2">I think that circling will provide for</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.190" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">therapists many of the things that David</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.870" end="00:05:12.100" style="s2">wohl is saying we need to do as</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">attachment therapists we get to we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.100" end="00:05:17.229" style="s2">to practice you know there&#39;s the what</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the how so as to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.229" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">circling shows the how and then also I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:25.780" style="s2">want to show how people so many people</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:28.150" style="s2">who are circling are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.780" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">attachment theory and also many people</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.150" end="00:05:32.889" style="s2">have a lot more even experience and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">study than I do in the community and I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.889" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">just want to be able to offer more you</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:45.729" style="s2">know more linking up of the concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:48.010" style="s2">the terms and give like flesh out the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.729" end="00:05:51.700" style="s2">conversation so this today is just an</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.010" end="00:05:53.970" style="s2">introduction to that and if you want I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.700" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">can just read a few of those concepts</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.970" end="00:05:59.740" style="s2">one thing I was just saying about but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:04.590" style="s2">like I like what what you described</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.740" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">about basically noticing they&#39;re tuned</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.590" end="00:06:11.470" style="s2">to different parts of the universe are</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">coming not something without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.470" end="00:06:16.570" style="s2">about each other necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:17.830" style="s2">and like I just like the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.570" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">just noticed that and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.830" end="00:06:20.889" style="s2">something&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:22.630" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been mining you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.889" end="00:06:24.039" style="s2">mining that and I think that that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.630" end="00:06:27.010" style="s2">of the one of the things I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.039" end="00:06:30.940" style="s2">for me I&#39;m I continually find greater</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.010" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">access or connection to deeper truths is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.940" end="00:06:35.650" style="s2">that when multiple perspectives or</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.120" style="s2">fields look at a phenomenon they start</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.650" end="00:06:39.070" style="s2">and they cut they maybe leave a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.120" end="00:06:42.610" style="s2">different language trail and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.070" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">reliable to those conclusions but which</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.610" end="00:06:47.430" style="s2">is it which is interesting yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:49.770" style="s2">it&#39;s that there&#39;s independent people</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.430" end="00:06:53.669" style="s2">looking at something and coming to very</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.770" end="00:06:55.380" style="s2">similar conclusions um yes look I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.669" end="00:06:57.810" style="s2">points to like the truth value of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.380" end="00:06:59.190" style="s2">something so I just appreciate that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.810" end="00:07:01.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve noticed that and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.190" end="00:07:05.550" style="s2">really in place that your interest is</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.290" end="00:07:09.780" style="s2">conceit and I also really like what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.550" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">said about the what in the how and my</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.780" end="00:07:19.530" style="s2">understanding is as a principal method</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:21.930" style="s2">right always perceives theory and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.530" end="00:07:24.270" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that because it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.930" end="00:07:28.350" style="s2">interim with the development of circling</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.270" end="00:07:33.720" style="s2">and a little bit why I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.350" end="00:07:35.669" style="s2">attachment theory and circling me is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.720" end="00:07:37.590" style="s2">is we all kind of notice if we really</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.669" end="00:07:40.229" style="s2">think about it somebody somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.590" end="00:07:41.910" style="s2">embodies or an ax a particular behavior</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.229" end="00:07:43.650" style="s2">pattern or a technique or something</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.910" end="00:07:46.169" style="s2">before it&#39;s distinct in language and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.650" end="00:07:47.910" style="s2">it&#39;s so many somebody knows is good oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.169" end="00:07:51.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a cool thing going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.910" end="00:07:54.120" style="s2">there what is that right and then and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.030" end="00:07:56.610" style="s2">then they abstract the theory out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.120" end="00:07:57.810" style="s2">what they see in the world so I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.610" end="00:07:59.729" style="s2">there&#39;s something about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.810" end="00:08:02.280" style="s2">something about how knowledge comes into</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.729" end="00:08:04.590" style="s2">being at least for human beings anyways</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.280" end="00:08:06.630" style="s2">as it seems that we enact something we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:09.000" style="s2">enact patterns and we know it through</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.630" end="00:08:13.020" style="s2">our our actions in our embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.000" end="00:08:15.930" style="s2">then we can then abstract like in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.020" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">language those patterns and then when</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.930" end="00:08:21.090" style="s2">it&#39;s really good theory which is I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:23.160" style="s2">what were what we&#39;re aiming to do here</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.090" end="00:08:26.330" style="s2">like that if those abstractions are</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.160" end="00:08:29.700" style="s2">really well done and well articulated</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:32.130" style="s2">then you can you can take the then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.700" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">theory then begins to feed into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.130" end="00:08:37.709" style="s2">method and makes it even more precise</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:39.930" style="s2">and in more tune and and in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.709" end="00:08:43.529" style="s2">feedback loop is really really important</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.930" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">oh I love I felt so inspired how you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.529" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">said that and I was just I&#39;m fantasizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.010" style="s2">about having a three-way interview with</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:53.700" style="s2">David Wallen because he lives in Marin</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.010" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">as far as I know and you know that or</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.700" end="00:08:56.700" style="s2">wherever he lives we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:58.600" style="s2">videoconference I really want to see you</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.700" end="00:09:01.810" style="s2">guys talking about this and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.600" end="00:09:03.880" style="s2">really excited for you to get I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.810" end="00:09:06.540" style="s2">you know I know that you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.880" end="00:09:09.160" style="s2">this already but to hear the quotes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.540" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">some of the terms and to deepen into</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.160" end="00:09:13.660" style="s2">them so but that&#39;s something I hope we</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:16.330" style="s2">can make happen you know invite him into</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.660" end="00:09:21.520" style="s2">the interview see you guys discuss what</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.330" end="00:09:22.780" style="s2">you just said sounds like aliveness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.520" end="00:09:28.330" style="s2">that sounds really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.780" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">yes so well I guess I was trying in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.330" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">last few days well here on the beach to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:35.230" style="s2">who finds you know to make a kite a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:37.420" style="s2">little bit of an overview and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.230" end="00:09:42.220" style="s2">already been going for about 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.420" end="00:09:49.660" style="s2">so um I want to try to make it succinct</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.220" end="00:09:53.380" style="s2">and let&#39;s see I think some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.660" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">important parts of what David Wallen</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.380" end="00:09:57.400" style="s2">says is important is there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:01.380" style="s2">phrase have you heard of this phrase the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.400" end="00:10:11.860" style="s2">stance of the south towards experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.380" end="00:10:16.120" style="s2">no but I think I think you do too</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.860" end="00:10:18.700" style="s2">and so what this so this was these were</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.120" end="00:10:20.170" style="s2">new terms to me from this book and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.700" end="00:10:24.490" style="s2">stance of the south towards experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.170" end="00:10:27.780" style="s2">and that there are three stances three</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.490" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">basic stances we can be embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.780" end="00:10:35.080" style="s2">experience and we can we can mentalize</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:37.810" style="s2">which is also a new term to me which I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.080" end="00:10:40.450" style="s2">think should be actually called</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.810" end="00:10:42.280" style="s2">perceptual izing because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.450" end="00:10:45.430" style="s2">that word itself can be misleading it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.280" end="00:10:50.200" style="s2">not just about thinking and we can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.430" end="00:10:52.540" style="s2">mindful and there&#39;s a lot of throughout</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.200" end="00:10:54.430" style="s2">the book it&#39;s repeated over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.540" end="00:10:57.280" style="s2">different by different people finding</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.430" end="00:10:59.860" style="s2">the same conclusions that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.280" end="00:11:02.440" style="s2">developing the stance our stance of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.860" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">ourselves towards our experience is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.440" end="00:11:10.150" style="s2">primary way to heal insecure attachment</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.210" end="00:11:12.339" style="s2">and so hitting upon that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.150" end="00:11:13.689" style="s2">biggest parts of saying whoa wait who</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.339" end="00:11:16.569" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing encircling we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.689" end="00:11:20.319" style="s2">studying our stance towards experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.569" end="00:11:22.629" style="s2">and the one of the ways in is through</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.319" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">the nonverbal through gestures and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.629" end="00:11:28.120" style="s2">posture and people who have not I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:31.660" style="s2">seen over and over circling with you for</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.120" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">on and off for five years hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.660" end="00:11:35.410" style="s2">circles I see people who are sitting</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:39.879" style="s2">down for the first time circling just</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.410" end="00:11:42.449" style="s2">referencing to each other about posture</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.879" end="00:11:44.579" style="s2">gesture nonverbal that this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.449" end="00:11:48.639" style="s2">referencing to us</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.579" end="00:11:50.920" style="s2">we&#39;re stance it&#39;s waking up the embedded</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.639" end="00:11:55.389" style="s2">emotional patterns that were laid down</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.920" end="00:11:59.290" style="s2">in our earliest experiences what is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.389" end="00:12:01.480" style="s2">how yeah like things that make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.290" end="00:12:05.649" style="s2">I&#39;m getting it so they say what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.480" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">saying is that there&#39;s who is it what</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.649" end="00:12:09.939" style="s2">was the name of the person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.610" end="00:12:11.800" style="s2">talking about David wollen wall and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.939" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">that one is that there&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.800" end="00:12:14.620" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:16.779" style="s2">there&#39;s making a distinction between our</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.620" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">experience and the neck like our stance</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.779" end="00:12:21.429" style="s2">and our the way that we are in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:24.759" style="s2">relationship to our experience is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.429" end="00:12:27.550" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about yes and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.759" end="00:12:29.170" style="s2">and what I heard is that that the part</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.550" end="00:12:30.970" style="s2">of what makes our experience our</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.170" end="00:12:33.339" style="s2">experience isn&#39;t something that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.970" end="00:12:34.779" style="s2">you&#39;d like embed in the distinction that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.339" end="00:12:38.620" style="s2">the experience isn&#39;t just something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.779" end="00:12:41.350" style="s2">happens to us and then we relate to it</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.620" end="00:12:44.379" style="s2">but it seems like I would imagine that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.350" end="00:12:46.689" style="s2">already have a stance in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.379" end="00:12:49.029" style="s2">whether conscious or unconscious as</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.689" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">you&#39;re saying in line he&#39;s embedded even</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.029" end="00:12:55.779" style="s2">deeper than unconscious that the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:59.230" style="s2">that I stand with my experience affects</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.779" end="00:13:01.449" style="s2">my experience yeah that&#39;s my experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.230" end="00:13:03.459" style="s2">it affects my stance I never imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.449" end="00:13:05.499" style="s2">there&#39;s ways in which that might stance</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.459" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">towards my experience he bends my stance</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.499" end="00:13:13.089" style="s2">right ways that notes that open you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:16.689" style="s2">rottenness small transcends that would</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.089" end="00:13:19.959" style="s2">get us to the mindful grant the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.689" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">one was embedded and this and that so</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.959" end="00:13:25.269" style="s2">that&#39;s when sorry good mentalizing and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:26.140" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.269" end="00:13:28.390" style="s2">accurate to talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.140" end="00:13:31.930" style="s2">talk about it is a perceiving stance and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.390" end="00:13:33.640" style="s2">then a mindful stance mm-hmm I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.930" end="00:13:34.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to step on I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:38.140" style="s2">to pronounce his name actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.930" end="00:13:39.250" style="s2">it&#39;s funny he is the man who came up</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.140" end="00:13:41.170" style="s2">with the word mentalizing I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.250" end="00:13:44.140" style="s2">to step on his toes but I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.170" end="00:13:49.330" style="s2">offer to the field to consider how were</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.140" end="00:13:51.610" style="s2">or or in the circling world for trans</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.330" end="00:13:54.840" style="s2">getting it for our purposes we could</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.610" end="00:13:58.510" style="s2">change the word for ourselves right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.840" end="00:14:01.180" style="s2">embedded is when you feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.510" end="00:14:03.010" style="s2">whatever thing is reality and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.180" end="00:14:06.760" style="s2">distance from it and what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.010" end="00:14:09.160" style="s2">fascinating is you can be disassociated</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.760" end="00:14:11.830" style="s2">from experience so you&#39;re not even in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.160" end="00:14:14.110" style="s2">the experience right so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.830" end="00:14:17.260" style="s2">degree of mentalizing that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.110" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">means you&#39;re both feeling it and can</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.260" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">reflect on it right because I think so</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:25.270" style="s2">this first dance of embeddedness which</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.760" end="00:14:27.400" style="s2">he says we all do from time to time but</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.270" end="00:14:29.080" style="s2">the degree to which we can move into</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.400" end="00:14:31.030" style="s2">mentalizing and mindfulness is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.080" end="00:14:33.910" style="s2">degree to which we are more securely</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.030" end="00:14:38.710" style="s2">attached it&#39;s a both a sign of it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.910" end="00:14:41.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a way to become so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.710" end="00:14:43.330" style="s2">secure attachment is not an end in</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.020" end="00:14:45.910" style="s2">itself and what I&#39;m reading is that John</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.330" end="00:14:48.220" style="s2">Bowlby didn&#39;t the man the theorists</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.910" end="00:14:51.330" style="s2">philosophers psychologists who coined</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.220" end="00:14:54.910" style="s2">the term and developed the theory that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.330" end="00:14:59.830" style="s2">he meant that - that he he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.910" end="00:15:03.370" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually a state of being - in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.830" end="00:15:07.750" style="s2">which we then can broaden our</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.370" end="00:15:10.540" style="s2">understanding of ourselves and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.750" end="00:15:14.020" style="s2">purpose is to connect with others but</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.540" end="00:15:17.230" style="s2">it&#39;s the one of the deepest purposes is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.020" end="00:15:21.060" style="s2">emotional regulation that the stance of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.230" end="00:15:25.230" style="s2">the self towards experience allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.060" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">understand our feelings as as messengers</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.230" end="00:15:31.960" style="s2">and but if we&#39;re embedded in it then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:35.320" style="s2">feeling is the reality not the message</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.960" end="00:15:37.090" style="s2">yes is it fair to say is it fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.320" end="00:15:39.640" style="s2">when I&#39;m embedded in my experience an</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.090" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">example of that would be when someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.640" end="00:15:44.110" style="s2">something to me and I get really upset</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.820" style="s2">or triggered is the is the term that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.110" end="00:15:47.800" style="s2">use a lot like I get triggered and upset</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.820" end="00:15:49.720" style="s2">and I get really really angry and then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.800" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">have this view of you that you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.720" end="00:15:54.340" style="s2">know you&#39;re doing something bad to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.100" end="00:15:56.430" style="s2">and that justifies me getting angry and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.340" end="00:15:59.650" style="s2">being upset with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.430" end="00:16:01.210" style="s2">but I&#39;m actually like not but so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.650" end="00:16:04.060" style="s2">would be like an embedded experience or</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.210" end="00:16:09.310" style="s2">an example of that I think so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.060" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">until so a percept like perceiving my</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.310" end="00:16:14.290" style="s2">experience or borrowing his terms of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.430" end="00:16:17.650" style="s2">mentalizing my experience would be more</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.290" end="00:16:21.490" style="s2">like oh hang on a second I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.650" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">having a reaction just that just that a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.490" end="00:16:26.440" style="s2">little bit about like oh my there may be</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:29.380" style="s2">making the distinction between my my</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.440" end="00:16:31.450" style="s2">experience of you and my experience of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.380" end="00:16:34.870" style="s2">anger and that there may be a difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.450" end="00:16:38.230" style="s2">between that and what like in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.870" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">really happening yes like that making</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.230" end="00:16:45.000" style="s2">that that deep work more subtle or find</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:49.320" style="s2">kind of distinction between between</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.000" end="00:16:51.580" style="s2">reality and my experience mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.320" end="00:16:53.220" style="s2">absolutely and so that&#39;s why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.580" end="00:16:55.960" style="s2">clear that&#39;s what we&#39;re already doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.220" end="00:16:58.510" style="s2">any circle you drive up into that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.960" end="00:17:01.990" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do and I don&#39;t know many</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.510" end="00:17:04.839" style="s2">other I&#39;m sure there are other contexts</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.990" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">for therapists or people to practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.839" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">this I know there are nonviolent</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:12.760" style="s2">communication I mean there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:17.470" style="s2">different many many obviously many</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.760" end="00:17:20.980" style="s2">people and practices but but I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.470" end="00:17:23.410" style="s2">aware of one that is so available is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.980" end="00:17:26.199" style="s2">actual community as a regular practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.410" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">becomes a way of communicating in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.199" end="00:17:31.480" style="s2">world you know it&#39;s circling I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:34.420" style="s2">includes non-violent communication and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.480" end="00:17:36.580" style="s2">and adds to it I think it&#39;s a more or I</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.420" end="00:17:38.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know it extensively I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.580" end="00:17:41.950" style="s2">trying to determine that but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.800" end="00:17:46.870" style="s2">think that circling explore is even more</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.950" end="00:17:50.260" style="s2">of experience and therefore deepens our</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.870" end="00:17:53.050" style="s2">ability to reflect the reflective stance</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.260" end="00:17:54.730" style="s2">is another term for mentalizing</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.050" end="00:17:56.710" style="s2">well you know either ways I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.730" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">the beach behind you I&#39;m like well it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.710" end="00:18:02.140" style="s2">could lead to the beach like that right</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:08.290" style="s2">I could keep a good direction and take</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.140" end="00:18:10.420" style="s2">him back somebody better hi although</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.290" end="00:18:14.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a beautiful Sun it was burning</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.420" end="00:18:15.790" style="s2">the skin so we decided to I got my 15</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.680" end="00:18:19.410" style="s2">minutes for the day</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.790" end="00:18:19.410" style="s2">we&#39;re securely attached in the shade</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:24.930" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.550" end="00:18:24.930" style="s2">so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.500" end="00:18:35.570" style="s2">there&#39;s so much so like I said some of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.310" end="00:18:40.790" style="s2">that some of that there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.570" end="00:18:44.380" style="s2">weight so many ways to elaborate so when</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.790" end="00:18:46.610" style="s2">I heard you say is like really tonight</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.380" end="00:18:48.590" style="s2">maybe you can elaborate on this a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.610" end="00:18:50.350" style="s2">bit more of a bold b.o.b is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.590" end="00:18:54.820" style="s2">like saying there&#39;s a mic secure</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.350" end="00:18:58.550" style="s2">attachment ears right John Bowlby mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.820" end="00:19:03.620" style="s2">something that he didn&#39;t he can he think</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.550" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">that attachment was an and play is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.620" end="00:19:08.360" style="s2">what I heard you say there wasn&#39;t much</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:11.780" style="s2">difficult and you you made the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.360" end="00:19:15.860" style="s2">distinction that however the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.780" end="00:19:22.220" style="s2">regulation I that comes through being</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.860" end="00:19:24.140" style="s2">securely attached is it what it would</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.220" end="00:19:26.360" style="s2">both be say that that that what that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.140" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">gives but so if I have emotional</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.360" end="00:19:33.830" style="s2">regulation right and I can securely I</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:36.200" style="s2">have people in my life or groups in my</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.830" end="00:19:39.740" style="s2">life or a girlfriend or a husband or a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.200" end="00:19:42.470" style="s2">wife and I&#39;m securely attached easy is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.740" end="00:19:45.010" style="s2">that in itself emotionally regulating is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.470" end="00:19:45.010" style="s2">that what you would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.990" end="00:19:49.289" style="s2">that&#39;s the age I thought that throughout</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.600" end="00:19:51.330" style="s2">our life</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.289" end="00:19:54.020" style="s2">I mean secure attachment I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.330" end="00:19:54.020" style="s2">fluid state</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.350" end="00:19:59.700" style="s2">guarantee that you know how to work</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.330" end="00:20:01.590" style="s2">through complex problems with the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.700" end="00:20:05.210" style="s2">in your life so that&#39;s why I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.590" end="00:20:08.929" style="s2">circle winning teaches specific skills</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.210" end="00:20:12.270" style="s2">that parallel emotional regulation and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.929" end="00:20:17.990" style="s2">earning secure attachment about and so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.270" end="00:20:17.990" style="s2">can read a few of what are considered</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.140" end="00:20:25.169" style="s2">what happens with communication that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:27.659" style="s2">collaborative and coherent and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.169" end="00:20:29.220" style="s2">this is speaking for the parents but</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.659" end="00:20:30.600" style="s2">this is what we do on circling and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.220" end="00:20:33.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna just be saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.600" end="00:20:35.159" style="s2">over and over right obviously so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.000" end="00:20:38.010" style="s2">first one is that through the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.159" end="00:20:42.270" style="s2">interaction with the child or the circle</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:44.190" style="s2">II we learn as much as possible about</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.270" end="00:20:47.460" style="s2">the child&#39;s or the circle leaves</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.190" end="00:20:49.950" style="s2">experience their feelings their desires</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.460" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">their needs and their views so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.950" end="00:20:54.200" style="s2">the first one learning as much as</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:56.549" style="s2">possible about the other&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.200" end="00:21:00.500" style="s2">there&#39;s four parts here the second one</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.549" end="00:21:03.270" style="s2">is that we actively engage ins a bull</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.500" end="00:21:07.380" style="s2">with the child or the circling each</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.270" end="00:21:09.450" style="s2">other during periods when when her sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.380" end="00:21:13.860" style="s2">this is a quote her sense of self and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.450" end="00:21:15.630" style="s2">others is in flux so that&#39;s the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.860" end="00:21:17.909" style="s2">how do we engage with each other when</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.630" end="00:21:20.760" style="s2">somebody&#39;s triggered like you said how</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.909" end="00:21:21.980" style="s2">do we stay with experience instead of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.760" end="00:21:25.500" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.980" end="00:21:30.809" style="s2">right how do we contact that experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.500" end="00:21:32.970" style="s2">and then the third one is we the parent</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.809" end="00:21:35.940" style="s2">the therapists or circle ease initiate</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.970" end="00:21:40.110" style="s2">interactive prepare when disruptions</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.940" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">occur some of these are quotes and these</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.110" end="00:21:49.210" style="s2">are on page 193 to 194 in the Wallen</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:51.160" style="s2">book then the fourth part is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.210" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">like this is a brilliant part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.160" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">circling that I learned from you upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:56.800" style="s2">the dialogue to keep up with the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:22:00.490" style="s2">or circle these emerging potential so</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.800" end="00:22:02.560" style="s2">encircling this is the edge that we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.490" end="00:22:05.290" style="s2">a being with what is and being with what</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.560" end="00:22:07.930" style="s2">is becoming without pushing for things</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.290" end="00:22:10.780" style="s2">to be different than they are yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.930" end="00:22:15.010" style="s2">all right there those four parts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.780" end="00:22:16.870" style="s2">I appreciated what you said because my</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.010" end="00:22:19.150" style="s2">periods of my understanding of secure</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.870" end="00:22:20.770" style="s2">attachment you know and in being game</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.150" end="00:22:24.300" style="s2">personally being in a relationship in</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.770" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">which we have the explicit context of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.300" end="00:22:29.380" style="s2">understanding about secure attachment</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:31.690" style="s2">and work on it like consciously and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.380" end="00:22:34.210" style="s2">that isn&#39;t really helpful such that both</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.650" end="00:23:02.830" style="s2">ambiguous and improvisational did I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.100" end="00:23:05.140" style="s2">one relationship that isn&#39;t right at one</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.060" end="00:23:47.170" style="s2">noticed is that is I kind of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.340" end="00:23:49.270" style="s2">it in terms like in the context of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.170" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">relationship where we both like I have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.270" end="00:23:55.540" style="s2">job my girlfriend&#39;s name is Brianne like</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.540" end="00:23:57.430" style="s2">my job would Brianne is to is is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.540" end="00:23:59.980" style="s2">when she eats reassurance or she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.430" end="00:24:02.890" style="s2">anxious is to actually be there for love</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.980" end="00:24:05.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s a pet is 210</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.890" end="00:24:07.150" style="s2">- in the place of like just letting her</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.800" end="00:24:10.030" style="s2">know that I love her and I&#39;m right there</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.150" end="00:24:13.870" style="s2">and we go right to that place and if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.030" end="00:24:15.730" style="s2">assure her and her vice versa and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.870" end="00:24:19.240" style="s2">more confidence that we have in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.730" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">happening the more I&#39;ve come to realize</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.240" end="00:24:25.270" style="s2">that relating has at least and in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:27.160" style="s2">context of knocking about has less to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.270" end="00:24:29.730" style="s2">with what I call the relating before</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.160" end="00:24:33.970" style="s2">which was so much further downstream</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.730" end="00:24:37.810" style="s2">right of the problems that come from</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.970" end="00:24:40.750" style="s2">when were not securely attached and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.810" end="00:24:43.000" style="s2">arguments and dilemmas that end up</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.750" end="00:24:45.150" style="s2">downstream I always thought that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.000" end="00:24:49.090" style="s2">you need to work out those problems</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.150" end="00:24:51.280" style="s2">mm-hmm realizing is that not that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.090" end="00:24:54.430" style="s2">wasn&#39;t at the right location I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.280" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">where the relationship was that yes was</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.430" end="00:25:00.130" style="s2">before those conversations right in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:02.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a place deep in our nervous</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.130" end="00:25:06.750" style="s2">systems is pre reflective that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.770" end="00:25:08.950" style="s2">pre verbal I would say yeah yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.750" end="00:25:10.870" style="s2">like letting letting each other know</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.950" end="00:25:15.610" style="s2">that we&#39;re there in a deeply emotional</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.870" end="00:25:19.780" style="s2">way way upstream the experience of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.610" end="00:25:21.370" style="s2">when that secure yes there it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.780" end="00:25:23.650" style="s2">like we&#39;re not arguing anymore it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.370" end="00:25:25.870" style="s2">even like we don&#39;t have problems we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.650" end="00:25:28.080" style="s2">not arguing exactly we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.870" end="00:25:30.220" style="s2">problems but it doesn&#39;t feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.080" end="00:25:31.510" style="s2">figured out or work through those</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.220" end="00:25:35.080" style="s2">problems it feels like we just know</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.510" end="00:25:36.760" style="s2">where the relationship is yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.080" end="00:25:39.010" style="s2">when you what you&#39;re pointing to is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.760" end="00:25:41.350" style="s2">could be considered the base that even</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.010" end="00:25:44.890" style="s2">when on the surface there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.350" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">lot of turbulence that in yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.890" end="00:25:52.900" style="s2">in the field with the person you feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:54.460" style="s2">you feel a security underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:57.640" style="s2">turbulence and that&#39;s what I think the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.460" end="00:25:58.990" style="s2">agreements encircling are providing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.640" end="00:26:03.100" style="s2">we even people we&#39;re sitting with people</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.990" end="00:26:05.470" style="s2">we don&#39;t know or we know in the context</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.100" end="00:26:08.410" style="s2">of circling so we&#39;re all agreeing to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.470" end="00:26:12.070" style="s2">certain principles and practices and to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.410" end="00:26:14.800" style="s2">me I&#39;m I&#39;m wondering and I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.070" end="00:26:16.780" style="s2">that I think that creates that field of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.800" end="00:26:19.540" style="s2">security because I trust</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.780" end="00:26:21.790" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to perceive me with</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.540" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">positive intent you&#39;re gonna perceive my</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.790" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">positive intention and that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.080" style="s2">you&#39;re striving to understand me and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:31.000" style="s2">what I think everything you just said</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.080" end="00:26:33.700" style="s2">what&#39;s most what&#39;s really important and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.000" end="00:26:35.800" style="s2">circling in this book is it teaches how</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.700" end="00:26:37.480" style="s2">how do we do those things how do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.800" end="00:26:40.060" style="s2">distinguish between upstream and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.480" end="00:26:42.370" style="s2">downstream and that&#39;s what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.060" end="00:26:45.730" style="s2">excited for people in general and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.370" end="00:26:48.180" style="s2">therapists in particular to practice to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.730" end="00:26:52.180" style="s2">get there&#39;s there there are mental and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.180" end="00:26:55.630" style="s2">perceptual representations that we start</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.180" end="00:26:57.820" style="s2">to get and so that are very key and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.630" end="00:26:59.170" style="s2">just read a few more things and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.820" end="00:27:02.740" style="s2">maybe we can start to bring it to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.170" end="00:27:07.740" style="s2">close and then next week go in-depth</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.740" end="00:27:07.740" style="s2">into some of these terms okay so</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.340" end="00:27:17.320" style="s2">so many great quotes but still just</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.350" end="00:27:21.910" style="s2">trying to give an outline so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.320" end="00:27:25.180" style="s2">talking about Oh deal is central our</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.910" end="00:27:26.980" style="s2">sense of who we are and so a practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.180" end="00:27:30.130" style="s2">that provides for the practical process</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.980" end="00:27:33.660" style="s2">of attachment healing would be one that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.130" end="00:27:35.110" style="s2">does three things one is it encourages</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.660" end="00:27:38.200" style="s2">identification of our subjective</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.110" end="00:27:40.540" style="s2">experience so we&#39;re really identifying</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.200" end="00:27:43.450" style="s2">with the felt experience its body</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.540" end="00:27:47.410" style="s2">oriented this is a somatic approach to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.450" end="00:27:50.590" style="s2">healing the second one is it illuminates</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.410" end="00:27:53.050" style="s2">and evolves how we feel about our</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.590" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">feelings that&#39;s the stance you know can</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.050" end="00:27:58.180" style="s2">we accept that we&#39;re angry can we accept</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:28:01.270" style="s2">that were afraid or are we just fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.180" end="00:28:05.650" style="s2">are we just anger without any reflection</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.270" end="00:28:07.960" style="s2">and the third part is it this process</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.650" end="00:28:09.340" style="s2">would help us to effectively express</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.960" end="00:28:11.560" style="s2">ourselves and be understood in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.340" end="00:28:14.970" style="s2">relationship and that&#39;s what the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.560" end="00:28:19.060" style="s2">aim of circling is is to how we express</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.970" end="00:28:23.470" style="s2">and are we being understood are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.060" end="00:28:25.570" style="s2">getting my world and I keep seeing over</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.470" end="00:28:27.100" style="s2">and over these outlines that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.570" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">describe circling in a nutshell how did</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.100" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">you do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:33.880" style="s2">how did the whole community and you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:35.610" style="s2">to this place maybe you can answer now</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.880" end="00:28:44.050" style="s2">maybe we can talk about it later</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.610" end="00:28:49.030" style="s2">yeah I I mean this is a big question but</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.050" end="00:28:50.950" style="s2">I think but but I think that like it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.030" end="00:28:52.840" style="s2">mean really a lot of it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:56.530" style="s2">there&#39;s just there&#39;s such a profound</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.840" end="00:28:59.500" style="s2">sense of a capacity for listening that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.530" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">think that an understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.500" end="00:29:03.610" style="s2">circling embodies it goes so far beyond</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:07.260" style="s2">what I understand to be is like active</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.610" end="00:29:10.030" style="s2">listening or even a Pathak listening</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.260" end="00:29:12.850" style="s2">that&#39;s really grounded I think in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.030" end="00:29:15.940" style="s2">sense of of giving yourself permission</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.850" end="00:29:19.390" style="s2">to be really really really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.940" end="00:29:22.210" style="s2">another person and at the same time be</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.390" end="00:29:23.720" style="s2">interested having one piece of attention</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.210" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">really over there and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.720" end="00:29:31.370" style="s2">same time being aware of like what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:32.929" style="s2">like for me and how am I being impacted</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.370" end="00:29:36.770" style="s2">through the process of listening and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.929" end="00:29:38.900" style="s2">understanding person and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.770" end="00:29:42.980" style="s2">things I realized that that does is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.900" end="00:29:45.559" style="s2">seems to it seems to it seems to invite</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.980" end="00:29:48.169" style="s2">a kind of disclose of space that then</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.559" end="00:29:51.710" style="s2">calls forwarded discovery of what what</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.169" end="00:29:54.409" style="s2">who you are together and like in one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.710" end="00:29:56.450" style="s2">those we start to bring language about</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.409" end="00:29:59.780" style="s2">like oh how it is really for you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.450" end="00:30:01.730" style="s2">not just that you feel sad that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.780" end="00:30:04.130" style="s2">for example if they talk about feeling</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.730" end="00:30:07.400" style="s2">sad but like that it makes sense that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.130" end="00:30:08.980" style="s2">you feel sad and that ms makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.400" end="00:30:11.000" style="s2">that you feel sad is because of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.980" end="00:30:13.250" style="s2">background which has a particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.000" end="00:30:15.470" style="s2">structure that&#39;s different than mine</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.250" end="00:30:17.000" style="s2">that we can discover together so in</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.470" end="00:30:18.890" style="s2">looking through the sadness as we</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.000" end="00:30:22.309" style="s2">explore the sadness and then I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.890" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">my responses to the sadness or reflexes</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.309" end="00:30:26.570" style="s2">in relationship to and then I bring that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:30.230" style="s2">to language and then you start to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.570" end="00:30:32.120" style="s2">realize like oh actually I&#39;m not sad</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.230" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">about the thing I&#39;m sad about on some</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.120" end="00:30:36.049" style="s2">level mm-hmm I look at life in such a</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:38.659" style="s2">way that it looks</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.049" end="00:30:43.549" style="s2">it&#39;s worthy of sadness and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.659" end="00:30:46.400" style="s2">go right wow wow wow so it becomes a a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.549" end="00:30:48.830" style="s2">revelatory process that ends up both</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.400" end="00:30:53.299" style="s2">people end up being changed by in my</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.830" end="00:30:56.270" style="s2">experience and it does create it does</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.299" end="00:30:58.429" style="s2">create any deep experience of love and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.270" end="00:31:02.169" style="s2">don&#39;t even know why that exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.429" end="00:31:05.480" style="s2">that is like just sharing an insight</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.169" end="00:31:08.929" style="s2">that happens with us and through us</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.480" end="00:31:11.179" style="s2">about you creates this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.929" end="00:31:18.409" style="s2">affinity that is just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.179" end="00:31:19.429" style="s2">stunning and I think I just think I want</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.409" end="00:31:21.880" style="s2">to hear what you&#39;re gonna say but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.429" end="00:31:25.309" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a perfect place to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.880" end="00:31:27.110" style="s2">start to pause and I mean I cannot wait</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.309" end="00:31:31.780" style="s2">to continue this conversation but what</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.110" end="00:31:34.460" style="s2">were you gonna say oh yeah there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.780" end="00:31:36.260" style="s2">on one level I think you&#39;re right I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.460" end="00:31:39.890" style="s2">think that experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.260" end="00:31:43.970" style="s2">deeply seen and both of us deeply seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.890" end="00:31:46.090" style="s2">you and experiencing being you know can</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.970" end="00:31:48.500" style="s2">at times profoundly impacted by that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.090" end="00:31:51.080" style="s2">opens up our hearts which input</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.500" end="00:31:53.630" style="s2">implicitly in a radical way I would</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.080" end="00:31:55.670" style="s2">imagine has a deep attunement and an</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.630" end="00:31:58.580" style="s2">effective level at an emotional level</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.670" end="00:32:00.500" style="s2">yes right yes I&#39;d like you gotta have</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.580" end="00:32:02.510" style="s2">like the conscious you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.500" end="00:32:04.100" style="s2">say that you were perceiving our</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.510" end="00:32:07.900" style="s2">experience it&#39;s going from background to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.100" end="00:32:12.850" style="s2">foreground subject goes object right on</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.900" end="00:32:15.110" style="s2">like a on a cognitive level and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.850" end="00:32:17.810" style="s2">simultaneously what&#39;s correlates with</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.110" end="00:32:20.150" style="s2">that cognitive like the the the glow of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.810" end="00:32:22.040" style="s2">those cognitions are the effective level</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.150" end="00:32:24.890" style="s2">of like the experience of revelation and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.040" end="00:32:27.230" style="s2">discovery and so we learned here that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.890" end="00:32:31.150" style="s2">would you feel like a deep a deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.230" end="00:32:34.220" style="s2">profound attunement and divinity that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.150" end="00:32:35.990" style="s2">opens up towards the unknown so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.220" end="00:32:39.260" style="s2">like simon cade they were moving like</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.990" end="00:32:43.250" style="s2">through discovering and no movie unknown</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.260" end="00:32:47.630" style="s2">we it feeds back into a deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.250" end="00:32:50.120" style="s2">security that opens opens us up more</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.630" end="00:32:53.450" style="s2">towards the unknown inside someone about</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.120" end="00:32:56.810" style="s2">it like and i like like an island and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.450" end="00:32:59.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve been been you know roughly spilled</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.810" end="00:33:02.780" style="s2">thinking about like culture for example</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.980" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">we live in a culture but we&#39;re also our</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.780" end="00:33:07.430" style="s2">own little cultures each person is our</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.120" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">own little culture so to say and if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.430" end="00:33:13.160" style="s2">a culture is like an island where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:15.710" style="s2">middle of the island is the most secure</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.160" end="00:33:17.930" style="s2">or the most structured or the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.710" end="00:33:21.050" style="s2">familiar and as you start to move</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.930" end="00:33:22.730" style="s2">towards the edge of the island where it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.050" end="00:33:26.390" style="s2">hits the water is where it becomes less</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.730" end="00:33:27.950" style="s2">and less familiar ring less informed</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.390" end="00:33:31.970" style="s2">until you hit the water which is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.950" end="00:33:34.340" style="s2">unknown yeah and that you know you to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.970" end="00:33:35.900" style="s2">if we&#39;re not and that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.340" end="00:33:37.520" style="s2">artist or the artist of the ones</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.900" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">culturally speaking that like</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.520" end="00:33:42.290" style="s2">exists in the act like right at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:44.870" style="s2">right where the unknown starts to become</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.290" end="00:33:48.200" style="s2">at like newly articulated through a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.870" end="00:33:50.540" style="s2">video through singing like painting</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.200" end="00:33:52.220" style="s2">sculpting you know our</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.540" end="00:33:53.390" style="s2">that are live at the edge right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.220" end="00:33:55.190" style="s2">they&#39;re not kind of part they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.390" end="00:33:58.310" style="s2">really the necessarily part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.190" end="00:34:00.980" style="s2">hierarchy of the structured culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.310" end="00:34:03.170" style="s2">towards the center but just like a play</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.980" end="00:34:04.850" style="s2">with the Beatles like all the innovation</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.170" end="00:34:07.880" style="s2">which at the time was just people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.850" end="00:34:10.460" style="s2">like what is this stuff and now it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.880" end="00:34:14.929" style="s2">basis of pop music right it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.460" end="00:34:16.700" style="s2">common but yes right yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.929" end="00:34:19.310" style="s2">stimulates so like eventually what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.700" end="00:34:21.380" style="s2">new becomes a simulated integrated in</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.310" end="00:34:24.190" style="s2">the culture and I think that when we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.380" end="00:34:28.400" style="s2">start to relate at this level that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.190" end="00:34:29.990" style="s2">the deeper we are the more mindful we</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.400" end="00:34:32.090" style="s2">can get of what we don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.990" end="00:34:34.340" style="s2">actually have an affinity towards it</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.090" end="00:34:36.679" style="s2">right when we&#39;re so we&#39;re bringing a new</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.340" end="00:34:40.730" style="s2">novelty yeah definitely that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.679" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">part of the essential practice is what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.730" end="00:34:43.910" style="s2">got from you and circling is how much</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:45.950" style="s2">can we be with the unknown so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.910" end="00:34:47.929" style="s2">description is really important and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.950" end="00:34:50.120" style="s2">I can&#39;t wait to do is flesh out I want</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.929" end="00:34:54.650" style="s2">to give you know some step-by-step</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.120" end="00:34:56.900" style="s2">processes to consider so I really look</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.650" end="00:34:58.460" style="s2">forward to I mean that sister this</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.900" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">relates just to profound thing when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.460" end="00:35:04.490" style="s2">think about it I think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:06.890" style="s2">start to feel you can start to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.490" end="00:35:09.480" style="s2">relationship with the unknown that in</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.890" end="00:35:11.910" style="s2">one of security</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.480" end="00:35:15.869" style="s2">right but you get the weight to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.910" end="00:35:18.660" style="s2">unknown like how much ease can you feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.869" end="00:35:20.190" style="s2">at that edge rather than the tension</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.660" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">like what is there what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.190" end="00:35:29.550" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen to me like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:35.150" style="s2">physical mental ability to recover that</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.550" end="00:35:38.430" style="s2">ease yes I think that is quite profound</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.150" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">mm-hmm thank you so much for being</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.430" end="00:35:42.660" style="s2">available right before I have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:47.089" style="s2">the airport and I will see you back in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.660" end="00:35:53.780" style="s2">Berkeley really soon that&#39;s it</p>
