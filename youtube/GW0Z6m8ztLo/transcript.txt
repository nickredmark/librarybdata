The problem with wanting to be friends with your children is that this is not enough
 Because as parents, you are not less than a friend, you are much higher than that
 You are someone who will live your child's life with a little luck
 You are a long-term island of stability
 In a sea of ​​difficulties
 And a child needs that much more than just a friend
 Parents answer to be courageous
 Because they answer that they let their children make mistakes. You must allow your child to fall while learning to walk
 Because they bump into the world a lot and you shouldn't do more to your child
 Who is absolutely necessary
 This means that it must be accompanied by some rough distance with your love and sympathy
 And for that, he must stand away and allow your child
 By walking stumbling towards ingenuity. But today's parents are terrified of their children because they are often afraid that they will
 They interfered with their children's lives that they would make irreparable mistakes
 But you must show the courage of your conviction when you have offspring and understand that if you sin
 That you can learn and forgive you for your mistakes. You don't have to be a perfect parent, but you do have to rise above your kids.
 Parents are terrified of making mistakes, which means that they are terrified of being parents and this prevents them from being fathers.
