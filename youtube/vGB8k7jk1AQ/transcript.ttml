<p begin="00:04:36.809" end="00:04:44.449" style="s2">together I recommend all of his works</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.449" end="00:04:51.539" style="s2">so from his works and in discussion with</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.539" end="00:04:58.169" style="s2">the grip of a problematic way of trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.719" end="00:04:59.789" style="s2">to interpret Buddhism so let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.169" end="00:05:03.479" style="s2">quick look at that and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.789" end="00:05:05.610" style="s2">return to what the central claims of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.479" end="00:05:08.819" style="s2">Buddhism are and I want to show you why</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.610" end="00:05:13.770" style="s2">even that way of putting it is proper</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.819" end="00:05:15.419" style="s2">perhaps incorrect so Bachelor in one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.770" end="00:05:17.460" style="s2">his books along with others and he folds</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.419" end="00:05:19.349" style="s2">it up with Buddhism without bu-but</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.460" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">beliefs and then later on this was</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.349" end="00:05:23.610" style="s2">followed up by even a more radical after</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:24.719" style="s2">Buddhism in which he&#39;s taking the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.610" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">position of somebody who&#39;s post</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.719" end="00:05:30.809" style="s2">religious very germane to many of us he</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:33.629" style="s2">but he does argue in alone with others</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.809" end="00:05:36.379" style="s2">that we face an interpretation crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.629" end="00:05:40.379" style="s2">when we&#39;re trying to understand Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.379" end="00:05:42.479" style="s2">we have two approaches that people give</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.379" end="00:05:45.300" style="s2">us for how we should try and interpret</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:47.909" style="s2">Buddhism of course this will not be</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:50.269" style="s2">relevant just to Buddhism but for any</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.909" end="00:05:52.559" style="s2">position that exists in a different</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.269" end="00:05:55.709" style="s2">culture or history that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.559" end="00:05:58.439" style="s2">understand via Buddhism or stoicism or</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.709" end="00:06:00.059" style="s2">Neoplatonism for example so he says we</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.439" end="00:06:03.659" style="s2">are confronted with two different</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.059" end="00:06:06.870" style="s2">positions one is the claim that you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.659" end="00:06:09.959" style="s2">only interpret Buddhism from within a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.870" end="00:06:13.319" style="s2">tradition and we have seen good reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.959" end="00:06:15.059" style="s2">why you might argue that that this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.319" end="00:06:16.830" style="s2">right the kind of stuff we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.059" end="00:06:18.959" style="s2">about here wisdom and self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.830" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">this is not largely a matter of altering</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.959" end="00:06:23.430" style="s2">your belief this is about going through</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.330" end="00:06:25.469" style="s2">transformation and your perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.430" end="00:06:27.659" style="s2">participatory knowing it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.469" end="00:06:29.249" style="s2">fundamentally altering your the agent</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.659" end="00:06:32.459" style="s2">arena relationship your existential</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.249" end="00:06:35.249" style="s2">modes etc and so if you are not engaged</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.459" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">with in the transformative practice then</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.249" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">of course you do not understand what</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:42.629" style="s2">what Buddhism is it has to in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:45.240" style="s2">be understood from within and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.629" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">general property of wisdom per se wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.240" end="00:06:51.330" style="s2">is something that must be understood</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:56.610" style="s2">from within the problem with that of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.330" end="00:06:59.970" style="s2">course is the it&#39;s myopic right there</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:07:04.500" style="s2">are very many Buddhist traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.970" end="00:07:06.840" style="s2">they are relative to certain times and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.500" end="00:07:10.310" style="s2">place in particular historical contexts</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.840" end="00:07:13.950" style="s2">and to claim that that particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.310" end="00:07:18.060" style="s2">interpretation a particular sect or</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.950" end="00:07:21.890" style="s2">tradition is the sole pathway to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.060" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">understanding or interpreting Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.890" end="00:07:28.050" style="s2">is of course myopic it&#39;s narrow-minded</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:29.970" style="s2">and often parochial it claims things as</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.050" end="00:07:34.590" style="s2">fundamental which are often very</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.970" end="00:07:37.920" style="s2">contingent so what&#39;s the alternative the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.590" end="00:07:39.570" style="s2">alternative is well what the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.920" end="00:07:42.300" style="s2">says is the problem with this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.570" end="00:07:44.190" style="s2">very subjective I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.300" end="00:07:47.130" style="s2">exactly the right word but the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.190" end="00:07:49.740" style="s2">is right this is the problem with seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.130" end="00:07:51.960" style="s2">things from the inside is that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.740" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">be very subjective and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.960" end="00:07:56.160" style="s2">means you&#39;re not understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.090" end="00:08:01.430" style="s2">phenomenon as is but you&#39;re only seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:08:01.430" style="s2">it through your own particular bias so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.630" end="00:08:09.870" style="s2">the alternative outside any tradition</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.660" end="00:08:12.270" style="s2">and this is typify Din the academic</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.870" end="00:08:14.190" style="s2">study of Buddhism for example like</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.270" end="00:08:15.960" style="s2">within religious studies or something</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.190" end="00:08:18.900" style="s2">like that and then the main argument</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.960" end="00:08:20.310" style="s2">here is and this will often happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.900" end="00:08:22.290" style="s2">not always the case but if you meet</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.310" end="00:08:23.970" style="s2">people in religious studies and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.290" end="00:08:25.350" style="s2">say are you studying Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.970" end="00:08:26.970" style="s2">they&#39;ll say yes yes I&#39;m studying</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.350" end="00:08:29.340" style="s2">Buddhism and then oh and then you&#39;ll ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.970" end="00:08:31.470" style="s2">them well what practices do you engage</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.340" end="00:08:33.450" style="s2">in and they&#39;ll say oh no no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.470" end="00:08:36.810" style="s2">engage in any practices that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.450" end="00:08:39.480" style="s2">mistake if I got in too involved too</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.810" end="00:08:42.150" style="s2">close to this material I would lose my</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.480" end="00:08:44.310" style="s2">objectivity I would lose my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.150" end="00:08:46.970" style="s2">critically reflect on it critically</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:50.280" style="s2">compare it to other traditions other</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.970" end="00:08:56.690" style="s2">approaches so the idea here is what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.280" end="00:08:56.690" style="s2">will have right is an objective account</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.389" end="00:09:04.779" style="s2">now although Steven doesn&#39;t mention this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.310" end="00:09:07.329" style="s2">in his book bachelor this bachelor</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.779" end="00:09:10.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mention in his book this is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.329" end="00:09:14.260" style="s2">reminiscent of the problem that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.570" end="00:09:21.699" style="s2">faced because what we have here is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.260" end="00:09:26.190" style="s2">transformative relevance and here we</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.699" end="00:09:31.329" style="s2">have some attempt to get at the truth</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.190" end="00:09:33.160" style="s2">and like the Socratic project I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.329" end="00:09:35.649" style="s2">put it to you and this is what I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.160" end="00:09:38.290" style="s2">Bachelor is saying is that Buddhism is</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.649" end="00:09:41.790" style="s2">about both of these it&#39;s about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:45.630" style="s2">find transformative lis relevant truths</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.790" end="00:09:50.199" style="s2">but that means we have to transcend both</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.630" end="00:09:53.110" style="s2">of these ways of interpreting Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.199" end="00:09:57.100" style="s2">so he points out that we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.110" end="00:09:58.170" style="s2">beyond both of these in some fashion how</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.100" end="00:10:03.550" style="s2">do we do this</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.170" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">well he points out that we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.550" end="00:10:08.050" style="s2">this in a way that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:11.860" style="s2">relevant to issues of meaning in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.050" end="00:10:13.449" style="s2">life so this interpretation crisis where</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.860" end="00:10:16.380" style="s2">we have these two competing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.449" end="00:10:19.740" style="s2">diametrically opposed ways of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.380" end="00:10:23.140" style="s2">interpret and import Buddhism is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.740" end="00:10:24.459" style="s2">actually interacting with the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.140" end="00:10:27.940" style="s2">crisis in society</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.459" end="00:10:30.550" style="s2">because we&#39;re not doing this just in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.940" end="00:10:32.019" style="s2">some empty cultural vacuum we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.550" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">precisely interested as I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.019" end="00:10:37.870" style="s2">suggesting throughout this series of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:40.690" style="s2">lectures where that we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.870" end="00:10:45.569" style="s2">precisely because we&#39;re deeply involved</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.690" end="00:10:49.089" style="s2">with the project of trying to recover</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.569" end="00:10:51.640" style="s2">how we can cultivate wisdom and enhance</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.089" end="00:10:53.319" style="s2">meaning in our lives in a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.640" end="00:10:55.750" style="s2">historical context that is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.319" end="00:10:58.180" style="s2">supportive and in fact often dil</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.750" end="00:11:01.899" style="s2">Asterius to those existentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.180" end="00:11:05.140" style="s2">necessary endeavors okay so what do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.899" end="00:11:07.870" style="s2">do we have to break out of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.140" end="00:11:09.850" style="s2">in some fashion and what he does is he</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.870" end="00:11:16.199" style="s2">tries to see where these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.850" end="00:11:20.110" style="s2">both fixated and what he argues is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.199" end="00:11:21.880" style="s2">this will become my Opik because it will</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.110" end="00:11:24.670" style="s2">get fixated on the particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.880" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">propositions of a tradition it will get</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.670" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">fixated on beliefs and this is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:35.050" style="s2">what you study over here objectively you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:37.209" style="s2">study of course the texts and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.050" end="00:11:43.870" style="s2">beliefs that have been propositional II</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.209" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">rendered by a particular tradition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.870" end="00:11:50.500" style="s2">this belief fixation that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">broken through this is why he entitles</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.500" end="00:11:55.269" style="s2">the book that came after alone with</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:58.779" style="s2">others Buddhism without beliefs because</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.269" end="00:12:02.170" style="s2">he tries to argue that part of what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.779" end="00:12:06.670" style="s2">preventing us from really getting both</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.170" end="00:12:10.870" style="s2">sides of Buddhism is that both of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.670" end="00:12:13.269" style="s2">are fixed locked like being locked</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.870" end="00:12:15.910" style="s2">inside the box in the nine dot problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.269" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to understand Buddhism as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.910" end="00:12:23.769" style="s2">set of beliefs we have gotten so used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:26.680" style="s2">this way of thinking and we&#39;ll see later</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.769" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">why it is a post-christian way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.680" end="00:12:33.430" style="s2">thinking that these traditions for</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:34.660" style="s2">cultic these axial legacy traditions for</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.430" end="00:12:36.819" style="s2">cultivating wisdom and self</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.660" end="00:12:40.839" style="s2">transcendence are to be understood as</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.819" end="00:12:45.730" style="s2">Creed&#39;s as systems of beliefs that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.839" end="00:12:47.529" style="s2">now even will equate right the word</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.730" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">belief with these practices we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.529" end="00:12:52.329" style="s2">about it as a belief system or will you</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">even use the word belief as a synonym</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.329" end="00:13:01.540" style="s2">for faith etc so we have gotten so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:13:03.430" style="s2">oriented towards this reduction of all</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.540" end="00:13:05.199" style="s2">of what we&#39;ve been talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.430" end="00:13:07.180" style="s2">all of this transformational process to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.199" end="00:13:08.620" style="s2">the possession and the assertion of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.180" end="00:13:11.980" style="s2">beliefs and again we&#39;ll see historically</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.620" end="00:13:15.639" style="s2">why that&#39;s the case that we can&#39;t break</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.980" end="00:13:18.569" style="s2">out of this interestingly although I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.639" end="00:13:21.389" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to do it in this video</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.569" end="00:13:23.620" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see that breaking out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.389" end="00:13:26.980" style="s2">right trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.620" end="00:13:28.060" style="s2">in terms of belief systems is also going</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.980" end="00:13:31.510" style="s2">to be needed to address the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.060" end="00:13:34.740" style="s2">crisis I have been pointing you towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.510" end="00:13:37.360" style="s2">that repeatedly belief systems namely</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.740" end="00:13:40.540" style="s2">ideologies are attempts to create</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.360" end="00:13:42.370" style="s2">meaning but they fail for the deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.540" end="00:13:44.350" style="s2">reason and you&#39;ve already seen a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.370" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">argument and evidence for this is that a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.350" end="00:13:49.380" style="s2">lot of your meaning-making machinery is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:52.210" style="s2">not occurring at the level of your</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.380" end="00:13:55.060" style="s2">propositional knowledge your your</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.210" end="00:13:59.170" style="s2">beliefs or and and your assertions of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.060" end="00:14:02.110" style="s2">which beliefs you adhere to so he</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.170" end="00:14:04.330" style="s2">proposes instead what we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.110" end="00:14:06.850" style="s2">we need to look at Buddhism ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.330" end="00:14:08.950" style="s2">existentially now you remember</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.850" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">existentially has to do with these modes</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.950" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">he also invokes in along with others the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:15.930" style="s2">distinction between the being mode and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:18.490" style="s2">the having mode and he proposes that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.930" end="00:14:20.710" style="s2">Buddhism is remembering the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.490" end="00:14:26.010" style="s2">and I&#39;ve already talked about that in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.710" end="00:14:28.180" style="s2">previous video and so he says look</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.010" end="00:14:29.650" style="s2">traditionally what the Buddha said and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.180" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">now we&#39;re returning to what the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.650" end="00:14:33.510" style="s2">said is in order to try and get more of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">what his enlightenment was about</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.510" end="00:14:37.420" style="s2">traditionally what the Buddha said is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:39.910" style="s2">presented as the Four Noble Truths and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.420" end="00:14:42.280" style="s2">these are four statements or</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.910" end="00:14:45.700" style="s2">propositions that are usually presented</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.280" end="00:14:48.010" style="s2">to our ears as claims to be believed and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.700" end="00:14:50.230" style="s2">that what makes you a Buddhist is if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.010" end="00:14:53.170" style="s2">believe them the problem with this of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.230" end="00:14:55.990" style="s2">course is that it is taking place at</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.170" end="00:14:58.630" style="s2">this very level that Batchelor argues we</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.990" end="00:15:00.250" style="s2">need to get beyond it&#39;s not of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.630" end="00:15:02.920" style="s2">that people don&#39;t believe things within</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.250" end="00:15:04.840" style="s2">Buddhism is that what we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.920" end="00:15:08.680" style="s2">about here these processes of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.840" end="00:15:10.750" style="s2">transformation are taking place at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.680" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">level of perspectival knowing at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.750" end="00:15:14.920" style="s2">level of transforming of states of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:16.960" style="s2">consciousness and at the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.920" end="00:15:19.810" style="s2">level transforming the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.960" end="00:15:22.510" style="s2">machinery of the self of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.810" end="00:15:26.470" style="s2">relationship and the modes of existence</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.510" end="00:15:28.630" style="s2">so we need to understand these Four</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.470" end="00:15:31.720" style="s2">Noble Truths as things that could help</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.630" end="00:15:33.850" style="s2">afford the kind of transformations we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.720" end="00:15:35.400" style="s2">been talking about the point about these</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.850" end="00:15:38.400" style="s2">is not to believe</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.400" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">the point about them is to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.400" end="00:15:44.310" style="s2">help you reenact the Buddha&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:48.900" style="s2">enlightenment if you&#39;re not doing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.310" end="00:15:51.720" style="s2">if you cannot enact enlightenment then</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.900" end="00:15:54.390" style="s2">you are not getting the Four Noble</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.720" end="00:15:56.190" style="s2">Truths he proposes therefore that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.390" end="00:15:57.690" style="s2">should not call them the Four Noble</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.190" end="00:15:58.920" style="s2">Truths we should call them the four</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.690" end="00:16:01.260" style="s2">ennobling Truths</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.920" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">I then proposed to him in person that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.260" end="00:16:05.610" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t even call them truths anymore</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:08.370" style="s2">because truths truth is a property of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.610" end="00:16:10.020" style="s2">propositions actually I said what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.370" end="00:16:12.690" style="s2">should call them is the four ennobling</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.020" end="00:16:16.920" style="s2">provocations you&#39;re trying to provoke</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.690" end="00:16:21.860" style="s2">people into change so let me try and go</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.920" end="00:16:26.540" style="s2">through the four noble truths but</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.860" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">restating them in turn as for ennobling</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.540" end="00:16:32.460" style="s2">enabling that means affording</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:34.920" style="s2">self-transcendence provocations by doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.460" end="00:16:37.620" style="s2">that I think we can get back to if</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.920" end="00:16:41.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the right verb what the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.620" end="00:16:43.860" style="s2">was conveying about what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.630" end="00:16:46.740" style="s2">enlightenment what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.860" end="00:16:51.510" style="s2">transformation is being brought about by</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.740" end="00:16:53.190" style="s2">the awakening experience and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.510" end="00:16:55.970" style="s2">alleviating okay so let&#39;s go through</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.190" end="00:16:55.970" style="s2">these one by one</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:09.030" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ll present the the standard</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.949" end="00:17:14.390" style="s2">way of representing the truth and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.030" end="00:17:18.150" style="s2">the reformulation in order to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.390" end="00:17:21.870" style="s2">bachelors I think astute criticism and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.150" end="00:17:23.339" style="s2">in order to interconnect with all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.870" end="00:17:25.920" style="s2">argumentation we have been developing</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.339" end="00:17:31.320" style="s2">throughout this video series so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.920" end="00:17:34.610" style="s2">first one is typically stated as all is</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.320" end="00:17:44.070" style="s2">suffering or all of life is suffering</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.610" end="00:17:48.980" style="s2">now that&#39;s first of all if that were the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.070" end="00:17:48.980" style="s2">this statement to be believed it&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.450" end="00:17:57.080" style="s2">because suffering is a comparative term</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.200" end="00:17:58.369" style="s2">and comparative terms can&#39;t be extended</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.080" end="00:18:01.309" style="s2">to everything that would be like saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.369" end="00:18:03.139" style="s2">everything is tall that doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.309" end="00:18:09.320" style="s2">sense things are only tall relative to</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.139" end="00:18:11.659" style="s2">other things being being shorter so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.320" end="00:18:14.179" style="s2">first of all it doesn&#39;t really mean all</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.659" end="00:18:18.019" style="s2">is it&#39;s something more like all is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.179" end="00:18:19.929" style="s2">threatened by well what&#39;s the all</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.019" end="00:18:22.249" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean everything in existence</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.929" end="00:18:23.929" style="s2">should we interpret it metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.249" end="00:18:25.489" style="s2">well I mentioned last time that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.929" end="00:18:27.590" style="s2">should be careful about giving</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.489" end="00:18:29.629" style="s2">metaphysical interpretations to what</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.590" end="00:18:32.600" style="s2">people bring out of these awakening</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.629" end="00:18:34.820" style="s2">experiences and the Buddha himself will</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.600" end="00:18:36.710" style="s2">Verret was famously reticent to give any</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.820" end="00:18:40.539" style="s2">metaphysical interpretations to his</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.710" end="00:18:43.429" style="s2">statements so let&#39;s try and follow that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.539" end="00:18:50.149" style="s2">in order to get at that let&#39;s note what</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.429" end="00:18:53.480" style="s2">this word means okay because again we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.149" end="00:18:55.580" style="s2">tended to allow a word to go through a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.480" end="00:18:58.820" style="s2">process of trivialization and reduction</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:19:01.509" style="s2">and we&#39;ve lost part of the meaning let</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.820" end="00:19:03.889" style="s2">me give you first of all that an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.509" end="00:19:08.899" style="s2">okay so the original meaning of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.889" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">word is insane but it has come to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.899" end="00:19:15.559" style="s2">synonymous with angry I&#39;m mad at Agnes</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:17.809" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m insane right it</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.559" end="00:19:20.590" style="s2">means that I&#39;m angry at Agnes how did</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.809" end="00:19:24.350" style="s2">that happen well one of the ideas is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.590" end="00:19:26.899" style="s2">anger is a state that can rent and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.350" end="00:19:30.889" style="s2">render you if it becomes extreme extreme</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.899" end="00:19:34.999" style="s2">anger can render you temporarily insane</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.889" end="00:19:41.749" style="s2">and therefore temporarily mad anger is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.999" end="00:19:48.759" style="s2">cause a pertinent cause of madness okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.749" end="00:19:51.139" style="s2">so suffering people usually hear pain</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.759" end="00:19:53.809" style="s2">distress when they hear the word</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.139" end="00:19:56.990" style="s2">suffering that person is suffering but</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.809" end="00:20:01.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually what the word means</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.990" end="00:20:05.270" style="s2">to suffer means to undergo it means to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.160" end="00:20:07.910" style="s2">Lu&#39;s agency so you can actually suffer</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.270" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">joy you can have so much joy that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.910" end="00:20:11.510" style="s2">sort of have lost control of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:15.140" style="s2">you can have so much pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.510" end="00:20:17.230" style="s2">it is not oxymoronic to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.140" end="00:20:19.400" style="s2">suffering pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.230" end="00:20:21.560" style="s2">it means I&#39;m having so much pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.400" end="00:20:26.140" style="s2">that I&#39;ve sort of lost control of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.560" end="00:20:26.140" style="s2">situation of the situation right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.490" end="00:20:32.930" style="s2">pain is a very powerful way of losing</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.650" end="00:20:35.210" style="s2">agency why first of all that&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.930" end="00:20:37.340" style="s2">disruptive and secondly pain is</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.210" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">associated usually with damage and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.340" end="00:20:45.710" style="s2">damage is a state in which we&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:47.840" style="s2">losing agency so right don&#39;t here just</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.710" end="00:20:50.810" style="s2">pain the Buddha is not saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.840" end="00:20:52.160" style="s2">everything&#39;s painful that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.810" end="00:20:54.200" style="s2">because if everything was painful</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.160" end="00:20:56.180" style="s2">nothing would be painful even all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.200" end="00:20:58.430" style="s2">your experiences can be painful</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.180" end="00:21:00.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean anything particularly</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.430" end="00:21:02.710" style="s2">because many of your experiences can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.470" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">be painful in and of themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.710" end="00:21:09.500" style="s2">because again this isn&#39;t an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:16.460" style="s2">kind of claim instead pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.500" end="00:21:20.150" style="s2">this connection rather than this one do</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.460" end="00:21:26.780" style="s2">you remember last video gave a parable</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.150" end="00:21:30.380" style="s2">of this suffering it&#39;s the monkey that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.780" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">grabs the pitch and then tries to free</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.380" end="00:21:35.150" style="s2">itself and then the other hand gets</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:37.940" style="s2">stuck in both paws and head and then it</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.150" end="00:21:42.440" style="s2">gets killed there is nothing in there of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.940" end="00:21:45.380" style="s2">pain most of the buddha&#39;s metaphors are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.440" end="00:21:49.250" style="s2">not paying metaphors there entrapment</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.380" end="00:21:52.490" style="s2">metaphors being fettered losing your</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.250" end="00:21:53.780" style="s2">freedom losing your agency that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.490" end="00:21:58.280" style="s2">the Buddha doesn&#39;t describe</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.780" end="00:22:00.290" style="s2">enlightenment in terms of relief but he</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.280" end="00:22:02.810" style="s2">would famously say just like wherever</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.290" end="00:22:05.630" style="s2">you dip into the ocean it has one taste</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.810" end="00:22:07.820" style="s2">the taste of salt no matter where you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.630" end="00:22:11.050" style="s2">dip into my teaching it has one taste</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.820" end="00:22:13.250" style="s2">the taste of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.050" end="00:22:20.539" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.250" end="00:22:23.460" style="s2">so what he seems to be saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.539" end="00:22:26.370" style="s2">all of your life is threatened with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.460" end="00:22:30.950" style="s2">possibility of losing your freedom so</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.370" end="00:22:36.510" style="s2">let&#39;s go from all is suffering to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.950" end="00:22:44.519" style="s2">provocation realize that all of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.510" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">life is threatened with a loss of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.519" end="00:22:51.960" style="s2">freedom a loss of agency and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:54.809" style="s2">word for this kind of loss that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.960" end="00:22:58.370" style="s2">translated as suffering which is dukkha</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.809" end="00:23:01.019" style="s2">dukkha again does not mean pain</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:06.870" style="s2">what does dukkha mean well the etymology</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.019" end="00:23:09.899" style="s2">is imagine you have a wheel and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.870" end="00:23:11.340" style="s2">off-center on its axis so the axle is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.899" end="00:23:13.289" style="s2">not properly going through the center of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.340" end="00:23:16.760" style="s2">the wheel and as the wheel is turning</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.289" end="00:23:20.700" style="s2">it&#39;s destroying itself there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.760" end="00:23:23.549" style="s2">self-destructiveness or you have your</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.700" end="00:23:26.730" style="s2">arm is out of joint it&#39;s disjointed like</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.549" end="00:23:29.340" style="s2">when and when Shakespeare has Hamlet</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.730" end="00:23:31.980" style="s2">says the time is out of joint right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.340" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">out of joint and as you&#39;re moving your</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.980" end="00:23:38.490" style="s2">arm it&#39;s destroying itself so it means</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:41.010" style="s2">like an empty gap that&#39;s sort of dirty</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.490" end="00:23:43.380" style="s2">so that as things are moving within it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.010" end="00:23:46.049" style="s2">they&#39;re destroying themselves so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.380" end="00:23:49.799" style="s2">idea of something that&#39;s engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.049" end="00:23:52.409" style="s2">process of self destruction which of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.799" end="00:23:55.260" style="s2">course is one of the powerful ways you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.409" end="00:23:57.450" style="s2">can lose your agency is through self</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.260" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">destructive processes it&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.450" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">on here so realize that all of your life</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:11.070" style="s2">is threatened very really threatened</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:13.159" style="s2">existentially threatened by a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.070" end="00:24:15.539" style="s2">for self destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.159" end="00:24:17.549" style="s2">self-deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.539" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">so now you see what he&#39;s doing is so</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.669" end="00:24:30.360" style="s2">how can we try and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.750" end="00:24:30.360" style="s2">understand this a little bit better so</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.390" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">this is work based on some stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.280" end="00:24:40.090" style="s2">published with Leo Ferraro and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:43.150" style="s2">talk about some additional and important</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.090" end="00:24:51.130" style="s2">new work by Mark Lewis I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.150" end="00:24:55.000" style="s2">trace a kind of pattern in your</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.130" end="00:24:59.260" style="s2">cognitive processing that can very often</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.000" end="00:25:01.960" style="s2">occur and and the core of the argument I</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.260" end="00:25:04.210" style="s2">want to make is the very processes that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.960" end="00:25:05.320" style="s2">make you adaptively intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.210" end="00:25:08.260" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about this from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.320" end="00:25:13.080" style="s2">beginning also make you vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.260" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2">self deceptive self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.080" end="00:25:29.029" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say you encounter an event</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.530" end="00:25:31.339" style="s2">and you interpret the event is bad okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.029" end="00:25:33.589" style="s2">now one of the adaptive machines you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.339" end="00:25:36.019" style="s2">have is your brain immediately is trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.589" end="00:25:40.419" style="s2">to predict and anticipate are there</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.019" end="00:25:43.129" style="s2">events like that the point of right you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.419" end="00:25:45.799" style="s2">encountering something potentially even</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.129" end="00:25:49.929" style="s2">painful or distressing is not just to uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.799" end="00:25:51.739" style="s2">it&#39;s to make you sensitive in</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.929" end="00:25:54.619" style="s2">anticipating what&#39;s going to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.739" end="00:25:56.299" style="s2">the future okay so your brain now tries</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.619" end="00:26:01.129" style="s2">to assess the probability of another</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.299" end="00:26:03.019" style="s2">event like this happening now well go</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.129" end="00:26:05.419" style="s2">tuned we&#39;ll get into this in more detail</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.019" end="00:26:08.109" style="s2">later although we&#39;ve talked a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.419" end="00:26:13.009" style="s2">it already with ideas about salience is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.109" end="00:26:15.139" style="s2">I can&#39;t take it in all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.009" end="00:26:17.599" style="s2">information available to me if I was to</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.139" end="00:26:19.669" style="s2">try and calculate the actual probability</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.599" end="00:26:22.689" style="s2">of event I would have to track all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.669" end="00:26:25.309" style="s2">variables in my environment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.689" end="00:26:28.459" style="s2">astronomically vast even a supercomputer</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.309" end="00:26:29.569" style="s2">cannot possibly do this right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.459" end="00:26:31.939" style="s2">thing the seeing is when we do</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.569" end="00:26:33.979" style="s2">probability problems in school we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.939" end="00:26:37.069" style="s2">given all the variables by stipulation</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.979" end="00:26:39.949" style="s2">but the real world doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.069" end="00:26:42.439" style="s2">the real world has an indefinitely large</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.949" end="00:26:46.699" style="s2">set of variables interacting in an</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.439" end="00:26:49.069" style="s2">indefinitely large number of ways so</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.699" end="00:26:51.529" style="s2">what do we do well we use what are</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.069" end="00:26:54.859" style="s2">called heuristics we use shortcuts that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.529" end="00:26:56.839" style="s2">try and help us cut through and zero in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.859" end="00:26:58.609" style="s2">on the relevant data the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.839" end="00:27:00.889" style="s2">information because we&#39;ve said before</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.609" end="00:27:03.499" style="s2">the zeroing in on relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.889" end="00:27:07.869" style="s2">is crucial so one of the things we do is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.499" end="00:27:07.869" style="s2">we use the representativeness heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.079" end="00:27:17.539" style="s2">you judge how probable an event is by</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.179" end="00:27:20.619" style="s2">how prototypical it is how salient it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.539" end="00:27:25.789" style="s2">how much it stands out in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.619" end="00:27:27.169" style="s2">right and that will often interact with</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.789" end="00:27:31.219" style="s2">another heuristic the availability</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.169" end="00:27:33.379" style="s2">heuristic this is you judge how probable</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.219" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">an event is by how easy you can remember</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.379" end="00:27:39.399" style="s2">a similar event occurring or how easily</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:41.539" style="s2">you can imagine another event occurring</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.399" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">so these are these are actually very</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.539" end="00:27:44.660" style="s2">adaptive for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.710" end="00:27:45.890" style="s2">now the problem is you&#39;re in a bad state</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.660" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">because you&#39;ve just had something bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.890" end="00:27:55.640" style="s2">happen to you now that that trigger is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.890" style="s2">thing called encoding specificity when</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.640" end="00:27:59.330" style="s2">you&#39;re sad it&#39;s very difficult to for</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.890" end="00:28:01.790" style="s2">you to remember events in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.330" end="00:28:03.590" style="s2">happy it&#39;s very easy for you to remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.790" end="00:28:05.060" style="s2">events in which you&#39;re sad because</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.590" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">that&#39;s because your memory doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.060" end="00:28:09.920" style="s2">store the facts it stores all that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">perspectival participatory knowing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.920" end="00:28:14.900" style="s2">also stores the state you are in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:16.430" style="s2">leads to very sort of paradoxical things</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.900" end="00:28:20.600" style="s2">if you lose your keys when you&#39;re drunk</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.430" end="00:28:22.010" style="s2">one of the things you should do if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.600" end="00:28:23.900" style="s2">want to get your keys back is get drunk</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.010" end="00:28:25.550" style="s2">again because chances are it will</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.900" end="00:28:27.110" style="s2">improve your memory if you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.550" end="00:28:28.970" style="s2">for a test and you have a headache and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.110" end="00:28:31.070" style="s2">you take some aspirin when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.970" end="00:28:32.600" style="s2">actually doing the test take the aspirin</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.070" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">because it will improve your performance</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.600" end="00:28:38.870" style="s2">I mean so there&#39;s classic experiments on</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:41.620" style="s2">this in one experiment right you have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.870" end="00:28:45.020" style="s2">bunch of people learning a set of words</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.620" end="00:28:47.960" style="s2">right in the same room Group A and Group</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.020" end="00:28:49.640" style="s2">B and then in the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.960" end="00:28:52.340" style="s2">experiment Group A does it in the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.640" end="00:28:53.750" style="s2">room group B does it in a different room</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.340" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the only difference in them</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.750" end="00:28:59.030" style="s2">Group A will remember a significant</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:00.970" style="s2">greater number of words than Group B</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.030" end="00:29:04.340" style="s2">just because they&#39;re in the same room</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.970" end="00:29:06.020" style="s2">okay now this is very adaptive you may</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.340" end="00:29:08.750" style="s2">say that&#39;s great no it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.020" end="00:29:10.700" style="s2">your brain is trying to always fit you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.750" end="00:29:13.880" style="s2">to the environment so it doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.700" end="00:29:16.040" style="s2">store information it stores how you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.880" end="00:29:18.440" style="s2">fitted to the environment or the context</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.040" end="00:29:20.170" style="s2">it&#39;s very adaptive so now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.440" end="00:29:24.470" style="s2">happening here</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.170" end="00:29:26.690" style="s2">well you you&#39;re in a bad state so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.470" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">easy for you to remember bad things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.690" end="00:29:31.700" style="s2">means it&#39;s easy for you to remember bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:33.710" style="s2">things and that means you judge the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.700" end="00:29:36.530" style="s2">probability of bad things happening to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.710" end="00:29:38.260" style="s2">be increasing this bad thing just</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.530" end="00:29:41.210" style="s2">happened to you so it&#39;s very salient</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.260" end="00:29:42.650" style="s2">that makes you judge that it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.210" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">probable it&#39;s going to happen and these</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.650" end="00:29:48.740" style="s2">are reinforcing each other now all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:53.210" style="s2">this is interacting with what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.740" end="00:29:54.830" style="s2">the confirmation bias we&#39;ll go over a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.210" end="00:29:56.570" style="s2">lot more of this later when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.830" end="00:30:00.050" style="s2">about problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.570" end="00:30:02.030" style="s2">what this is is an adoptive strategy you</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.050" end="00:30:06.470" style="s2">use where you tend to only look for</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.030" end="00:30:10.910" style="s2">information that supports your current</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.470" end="00:30:13.910" style="s2">belief because very often trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.910" end="00:30:17.900" style="s2">this confirmation is takes too long and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.910" end="00:30:21.830" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult and complex so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.900" end="00:30:24.710" style="s2">tend to look for what confirms so now</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.830" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">the confirmation bias now as I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.710" end="00:30:27.410" style="s2">through my memory in my imagination I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:30.920" style="s2">will tend to look for things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.410" end="00:30:34.580" style="s2">confirm my forming judgment that this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.920" end="00:30:37.850" style="s2">event is highly probable now all of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.580" end="00:30:40.970" style="s2">machinery can go awry right all of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.850" end="00:30:42.860" style="s2">heuristics will mislead you it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.970" end="00:30:44.780" style="s2">of this heuristic that people make</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.860" end="00:30:47.060" style="s2">mistakes when they take loved ones to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.780" end="00:30:49.610" style="s2">the airport and things like that right</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.060" end="00:30:52.370" style="s2">because we can imagine planes falling</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.610" end="00:30:54.410" style="s2">from the sky and when it does it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.370" end="00:30:56.360" style="s2">representative for us as people describe</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.410" end="00:30:57.860" style="s2">it as a tragedy it&#39;s in the news and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.360" end="00:30:59.950" style="s2">we judged air-crane</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.860" end="00:31:01.820" style="s2">airplane crashes to be highly probable</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.950" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">even though they&#39;re very low in</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.820" end="00:31:08.540" style="s2">probability but then we turn and get</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:09.980" style="s2">into an auto or automobile which is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.540" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">North American death machine without</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.980" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">paying any attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:18.110" style="s2">so we misjudge probabilities because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:19.460" style="s2">these heuristics now we can&#39;t do without</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.110" end="00:31:21.830" style="s2">them it&#39;s like when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.460" end="00:31:23.450" style="s2">hyperbolic discounting you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.830" end="00:31:25.850" style="s2">without them they&#39;re adaptive you need</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.450" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">them let&#39;s continue this so these are</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.850" end="00:31:30.610" style="s2">all reinforcing each other the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:36.040" style="s2">confirmation bias so now what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.610" end="00:31:36.040" style="s2">you judge the probability to be great</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.320" end="00:31:46.620" style="s2">okay now notice how most of this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.800" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">happening automatically in an</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.000" end="00:32:29.650" style="s2">adaptively indispensable for you okay so</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.090" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">you judge the probability is great well</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.650" end="00:32:34.660" style="s2">what effect is that judgment have on you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:38.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not emotionally neutral okay that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.660" end="00:32:42.190" style="s2">makes you anxious when your brain starts</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.830" end="00:32:46.500" style="s2">to conclude that the probability of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.190" end="00:32:46.500" style="s2">negative ents is high you get anxiety</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.950" end="00:32:55.170" style="s2">well you lose cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.280" end="00:33:05.620" style="s2">you&#39;re framing on things becomes very</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.680" end="00:33:06.310" style="s2">narrow very rigid very limited what does</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.570" end="00:33:34.510" style="s2">lots of mistakes and fail what does that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.250" end="00:33:40.630" style="s2">do well of course that increases your</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.420" end="00:33:52.770" style="s2">does all that do well all of this starts</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.980" end="00:36:53.500" style="s2">why because it&#39;s making sure it&#39;s making</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.490" end="00:37:25.630" style="s2">interesting as I said my colleague and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.869" end="00:37:28.420" style="s2">good friend Marc Lewis we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.630" end="00:37:31.180" style="s2">about comparing this to other work that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.420" end="00:37:32.740" style="s2">he he&#39;s recently been doing so some of</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.740" end="00:37:36.580" style="s2">recommend you take a look at his work</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.540" end="00:37:39.820" style="s2">Marc has been deeply influential in my</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.580" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">own thinking my ideas about dynamical</p>

<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:45.460" style="s2">development he is one of the four most</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.780" end="00:37:47.770" style="s2">important neuroscientists about</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.460" end="00:37:49.780" style="s2">addiction and how addiction works in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.770" end="00:37:54.359" style="s2">world I strongly recommend reading his</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.780" end="00:37:57.970" style="s2">book memoirs of an addicted brain so</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.359" end="00:37:59.170" style="s2">Marc was himself I&#39;m not disclosing</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.970" end="00:38:00.790" style="s2">anything confidential because it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.170" end="00:38:03.130" style="s2">in the book Marc was himself an addict</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.790" end="00:38:04.270" style="s2">in his youth and then he overcame his</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.130" end="00:38:07.510" style="s2">addiction then and he went into</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.270" end="00:38:10.589" style="s2">neuroscience to try and figure out why</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.510" end="00:38:14.770" style="s2">what is addiction how does it work now</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.589" end="00:38:16.780" style="s2">that&#39;s important because addiction right</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.770" end="00:38:22.180" style="s2">his addiction is primarily the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.780" end="00:38:25.390" style="s2">agency it&#39;s not I mean addiction is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.180" end="00:38:27.070" style="s2">distressing and painful but when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.390" end="00:38:29.500" style="s2">talking about somebody somebody being</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.070" end="00:38:31.630" style="s2">addicted the way we finally diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.500" end="00:38:37.450" style="s2">them is by how dysfunctional they become</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.630" end="00:38:41.320" style="s2">how much they lose their agency right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.450" end="00:38:43.180" style="s2">you are a video game addict if you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.320" end="00:38:45.400" style="s2">playing video games to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.180" end="00:38:47.859" style="s2">you cannot pursue the goals you want to</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.140" end="00:39:07.060" style="s2">processes then of course that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.780" end="00:39:10.089" style="s2">mean by addiction addiction is a loss of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.060" end="00:39:12.670" style="s2">agency now when you take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.089" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">Marc&#39;s work Marc challenges Marc Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.670" end="00:39:18.369" style="s2">he challenges right I just saw him give</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:18.950" style="s2">a talk I&#39;ve been having lunch with him</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.369" end="00:39:21.470" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.950" end="00:39:23.990" style="s2">I also saw him have just a really good</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.550" end="00:39:36.589" style="s2">year and it he was not the only person</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.250" end="00:39:39.050" style="s2">making this point but he articulated it</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.589" end="00:39:41.480" style="s2">with his own particular explanation</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.050" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">which is his so the point that many of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.480" end="00:39:45.950" style="s2">people are making is the standard model</p>

<p begin="00:39:45.950" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">wrong what&#39;s the standard model the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.450" end="00:39:53.300" style="s2">standard model is we have a biophysical</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:54.829" style="s2">chemical dependency and when the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.300" end="00:39:56.900" style="s2">chemical is removed we get an</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.829" end="00:39:58.790" style="s2">overwhelming compulsion to have to seek</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.900" end="00:40:02.750" style="s2">out the chemical and if we don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.790" end="00:40:04.430" style="s2">chemical then we suffer similar to as if</p>

<p begin="00:40:04.430" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">if we and so that&#39;s what addiction is</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.190" end="00:40:11.540" style="s2">and the problem with this is it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:14.660" style="s2">very commonsensical and the media likes</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.540" end="00:40:17.869" style="s2">it it has the one unfortunate feature of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.660" end="00:40:19.849" style="s2">being almost completely false because</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.869" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">first of all you can get addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.849" end="00:40:25.970" style="s2">processes that have no biochemical basis</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:29.569" style="s2">like gambling for example secondly if</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.970" end="00:40:31.130" style="s2">the if the overwhelming compulsion model</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.569" end="00:40:33.170" style="s2">was correct you have a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.130" end="00:40:35.030" style="s2">difficulty explaining some very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.170" end="00:40:36.980" style="s2">pertinent facts most people</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.030" end="00:40:43.810" style="s2">spontaneously give up their addiction in</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.980" end="00:40:46.310" style="s2">their 30s we of course get focused on</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.810" end="00:40:48.470" style="s2">the people who remain addicted and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.310" end="00:40:49.940" style="s2">therefore we come to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.470" end="00:40:52.700" style="s2">addiction is an overwhelming compulsion</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.940" end="00:40:57.369" style="s2">but if you actually track people many</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.700" end="00:41:00.859" style="s2">people spontaneously stop being addicted</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.369" end="00:41:03.950" style="s2">here&#39;s a great historical example you</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.859" end="00:41:07.670" style="s2">have soldiers in Vietnam during the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.950" end="00:41:11.300" style="s2">Vietnam War getting addicted to opioids</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.670" end="00:41:14.420" style="s2">in Vietnam the opioid crisis not that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.300" end="00:41:16.369" style="s2">isn&#39;t a crisis but we tend to think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.420" end="00:41:24.069" style="s2">certain chemicals are intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.369" end="00:41:26.589" style="s2">addictive so they get addicted to heroin</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.069" end="00:41:29.510" style="s2">when they return to the United States</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.589" end="00:41:32.490" style="s2">the vast majority of them spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.510" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">stop using the drug</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.490" end="00:41:38.950" style="s2">but but why chemical not in the body</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:41.800" style="s2">what&#39;s going on isn&#39;t there a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.950" end="00:41:46.630" style="s2">biochemical lack and therefore a huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.800" end="00:41:49.150" style="s2">compulsion well think about it think</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.630" end="00:41:54.930" style="s2">about it in terms of existential</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.150" end="00:41:59.230" style="s2">learning see when they were in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.930" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">they had a particular identity they&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.210" end="00:42:50.350" style="s2">so here&#39;s your agent and here&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.880" end="00:47:26.500" style="s2">a better way of thinking about it is</p>
