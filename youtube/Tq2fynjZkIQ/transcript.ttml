<p begin="00:07:20.979" end="00:07:25.389" style="s2">I&#39;ve been you know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:28.539" style="s2">communicating about various issues and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.389" end="00:07:30.129" style="s2">one thing that we we had a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.539" end="00:07:34.449" style="s2">discussion over that I want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.129" end="00:07:36.819" style="s2">eventually here was Jordan Peterson had</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.449" end="00:07:38.680" style="s2">a brouhaha and the press when he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.819" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">talking about his notion of enforced</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.680" end="00:07:45.099" style="s2">monogamy yeah and I brought that up</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.099" style="s2">thinking that it was very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.099" end="00:07:50.860" style="s2">how Jordan Peterson was able to trigger</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.099" end="00:07:55.150" style="s2">people into sort of advocating for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.860" end="00:07:57.130" style="s2">breakdown of the traditional family as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.150" end="00:07:58.779" style="s2">way to just argue with Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.130" end="00:07:59.979" style="s2">and you said that you wanted to have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.779" end="00:08:01.930" style="s2">talk about that and I thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.979" end="00:08:04.150" style="s2">great and I would definitely like to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.930" end="00:08:06.520" style="s2">to that but the first thing I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">talk about is just sort of lead in was</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.520" end="00:08:11.169" style="s2">we were talking earlier about your</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:14.169" style="s2">experience in writing a book with Tucker</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.169" end="00:08:17.139" style="s2">Max and I was hoping you could share</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.169" end="00:08:18.909" style="s2">sort of how you came to work with him</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.139" end="00:08:21.069" style="s2">and what that experience was like and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.909" end="00:08:23.860" style="s2">sort of some of your takeaways you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.069" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">from that I think Tucker had read my</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.860" end="00:08:28.659" style="s2">spent book and really enjoyed it it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.370" style="s2">about consumerism and business and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.659" end="00:08:32.440" style="s2">people sort of signal their traits</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.370" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">through the goods and services that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.440" end="00:08:38.050" style="s2">buy and display and I happen to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:40.570" style="s2">social psych conference in Austin Texas</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.050" end="00:08:42.099" style="s2">where Tucker lives a few years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.570" end="00:08:43.899" style="s2">we happen to get together for dinner and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.099" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">we talked about kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.899" end="00:08:48.190" style="s2">difficulties that young men face and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:51.790" style="s2">dating and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.190" end="00:08:55.240" style="s2">they have about evolution and women hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.790" end="00:08:56.950" style="s2">and mate choice and kind of what vector</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.240" end="00:08:59.320" style="s2">to go and what direction to try to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.950" end="00:09:01.900" style="s2">develop men and so Tucker and I decided</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.320" end="00:09:03.940" style="s2">we should write a book together and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.900" end="00:09:05.650" style="s2">ended up being the mate book made and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.940" end="00:09:09.520" style="s2">hardback or what women want and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.650" end="00:09:11.530" style="s2">paperback and we tried to integrate the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.520" end="00:09:13.450" style="s2">evolutionary psychology that that I know</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.530" end="00:09:15.670" style="s2">and that he actually read quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.450" end="00:09:17.470" style="s2">about with his sort of real-life</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.670" end="00:09:20.620" style="s2">experience of interacting with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.470" end="00:09:23.650" style="s2">women and being in the scene the dating</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.620" end="00:09:26.620" style="s2">scene for a while we learned a lot from</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.650" end="00:09:28.030" style="s2">doing our podcast the mating grounds</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.620" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">where young men would call in with their</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.030" end="00:09:33.430" style="s2">issues and we would kind of give them</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:36.190" style="s2">advice but we&#39;re what were some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.430" end="00:09:37.780" style="s2">main issues he said that he identified</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.190" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">that the young men were having problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.780" end="00:09:41.950" style="s2">today and you know I think right now the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.180" end="00:09:45.070" style="s2">the popularity of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.950" end="00:09:47.050" style="s2">filling up you know arena not arenas but</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.070" end="00:09:48.670" style="s2">you know large halls all across the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.050" end="00:09:51.400" style="s2">world actually now is like thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.670" end="00:09:52.900" style="s2">people you know it&#39;s speaking to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.400" end="00:09:55.180" style="s2">fact that there&#39;s sort of a Lost Boys</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.900" end="00:09:56.980" style="s2">generation out there so what what did</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.180" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">you and Tucker identify as being some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.980" end="00:10:02.140" style="s2">the problems I think the number one</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:03.610" style="s2">thing was that a lot of young men don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.140" end="00:10:05.380" style="s2">really have the perspective-taking</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.610" end="00:10:07.510" style="s2">ability they can&#39;t really put themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.380" end="00:10:09.940" style="s2">in the heads or the shoes of women and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.510" end="00:10:11.800" style="s2">ask well what&#39;s it like to be a woman</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.940" end="00:10:14.290" style="s2">what&#39;s their perspective what did they</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.800" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">really want and how can I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.290" end="00:10:18.310" style="s2">deliver it to them how can I make myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">into the kind of guy who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.310" end="00:10:23.950" style="s2">attractive and compelling to women and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:26.080" style="s2">you know we know from psychology that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.950" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">men are not as good at that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.080" end="00:10:32.230" style="s2">perspective taking or mind-reading as</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:34.030" style="s2">women are so when men go into the dating</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.230" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">scene and you know high school or</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.030" end="00:10:40.360" style="s2">college they really don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:42.330" style="s2">good advice from the culture or their</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.360" end="00:10:44.740" style="s2">parents about what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.330" end="00:10:46.089" style="s2">realistically between the sexes but</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.740" end="00:10:47.740" style="s2">they&#39;re getting some advice somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.089" end="00:10:49.510" style="s2">they&#39;re getting a lot of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.740" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">misleading advice that tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.510" end="00:10:54.210" style="s2">either sort of very politically correct</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:57.130" style="s2">that pretends there&#39;s no sex differences</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.210" end="00:10:58.120" style="s2">or they&#39;re they&#39;re reading you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.130" end="00:11:00.550" style="s2">pickup artists</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:01.400" style="s2">kind of red pill stuff which has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.550" end="00:11:05.510" style="s2">of Merit to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.400" end="00:11:08.540" style="s2">but but make some key mistakes you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.510" end="00:11:10.100" style="s2">in my humble opinion so what we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.540" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">to do is kind of well we&#39;ll get back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.100" end="00:11:14.300" style="s2">that yeah yeah I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.420" end="00:11:17.030" style="s2">we we tried to offer a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.300" end="00:11:19.250" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s based on science but</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.030" end="00:11:21.380" style="s2">also based on you know the lived</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:24.680" style="s2">experience that the Tucker and I had in</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.380" end="00:11:27.890" style="s2">our own relationships and what what did</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.680" end="00:11:29.990" style="s2">you guys sort of identify as an attitude</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.890" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">or a perspective that young men were</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.990" end="00:11:34.970" style="s2">getting from culture and society that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:37.910" style="s2">was inaccurate or even misleading or</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.970" end="00:11:40.580" style="s2">even in detrimental I think there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.910" end="00:11:43.790" style="s2">lot of misunderstanding about power</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.580" end="00:11:45.800" style="s2">dynamics in relationships where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.790" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">guys thought okay either I have to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.800" end="00:11:53.210" style="s2">mr. nice and super agreeable and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:57.470" style="s2">basically beg for sex and you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.210" end="00:11:59.840" style="s2">of feminist Ally and try to insinuate</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.470" end="00:12:04.310" style="s2">myself into a woman&#39;s affections through</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.840" end="00:12:07.250" style="s2">a kind of almost political manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.310" end="00:12:09.340" style="s2">or I have to go to the opposite extreme</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.250" end="00:12:13.490" style="s2">I have to make myself into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.340" end="00:12:17.630" style="s2">psychopathic alpha male who doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.490" end="00:12:20.600" style="s2">any empathy or consideration for women</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.630" end="00:12:23.090" style="s2">or any degree of agreeableness and there</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.600" end="00:12:27.050" style="s2">again we tried to make a sort of middle</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.090" end="00:12:30.170" style="s2">path that says women are very attracted</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.050" end="00:12:34.270" style="s2">to power and dominance and status and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.170" end="00:12:36.680" style="s2">prestige and confidence that is true but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.270" end="00:12:38.810" style="s2">women also want to see the qualities and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.680" end="00:12:42.140" style="s2">a man that would make for a long a long</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.810" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">term partner a good partner a good dad</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.140" end="00:12:48.010" style="s2">and a lot of that depends on you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:50.030" style="s2">agreeableness and kindness and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.010" end="00:12:52.100" style="s2">understanding the woman&#39;s point of view</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.030" end="00:12:54.920" style="s2">and your future children&#39;s points of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.100" end="00:12:58.640" style="s2">view right Psychopaths don&#39;t make good</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.920" end="00:13:01.870" style="s2">dads and and that&#39;s the argument we made</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.640" end="00:13:04.370" style="s2">that men have to become what we call</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.870" end="00:13:07.700" style="s2">tender defenders they have to be capable</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.370" end="00:13:08.870" style="s2">of defending women and kids and women</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.700" end="00:13:10.940" style="s2">have to trust</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.870" end="00:13:14.960" style="s2">it&#39;s true but they also have to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.940" end="00:13:17.150" style="s2">tender most of the time I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.960" end="00:13:21.290" style="s2">some people that I know would say that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.150" end="00:13:23.779" style="s2">that&#39;s building a better betta have you</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.290" end="00:13:27.920" style="s2">ever heard that phrase before yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.779" end="00:13:31.370" style="s2">understand that perspective but I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:35.390" style="s2">the whole alpha-beta terminology is very</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.370" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">misleading I think that those are great</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.390" end="00:13:40.640" style="s2">concepts if you&#39;re describing gorillas</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:42.770" style="s2">where there really is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.640" end="00:13:46.190" style="s2">alpha-beta hierarchy likewise with</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.770" end="00:13:49.490" style="s2">orangutans but humans lived in you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.190" end="00:13:52.730" style="s2">social tribal groups a very long time we</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.490" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">have multiple sources of status not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.730" end="00:13:58.490" style="s2">one we don&#39;t just rely on physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:14:01.130" style="s2">dominance we rely on intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.490" end="00:14:03.380" style="s2">creativity reputation how much value we</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.130" end="00:14:06.050" style="s2">can add to the group what our moral</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.380" end="00:14:08.270" style="s2">virtues are etc and that&#39;s how humans</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.050" end="00:14:10.850" style="s2">typically get status and what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.270" end="00:14:15.610" style="s2">attractive to each other so any given</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.850" end="00:14:18.410" style="s2">group yeah maybe there&#39;s one leader but</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.610" end="00:14:20.690" style="s2">not everybody can be a leader not all</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.410" end="00:14:23.529" style="s2">guys can sort of be the so-called Alpha</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.690" end="00:14:27.020" style="s2">nor should they try to be nor is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.529" end="00:14:32.029" style="s2">necessarily the morally best thing to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.020" end="00:14:34.040" style="s2">nor nor a society that are off if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.029" end="00:14:37.790" style="s2">know all the guys are trying to compete</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.040" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">to be the Alpha right I think you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.790" end="00:14:42.140" style="s2">certainly have a levelling up of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.440" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">confidence I think that&#39;s the key thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.140" end="00:14:46.510" style="s2">of young men figure out how do I build</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:48.620" style="s2">skills that give me a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.510" end="00:14:51.890" style="s2">confidence and a sense of self-worth</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.620" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">that&#39;s great but don&#39;t confuse that with</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.890" end="00:14:56.330" style="s2">trying to be the top dog</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.730" style="s2">I remember when Jordan Peterson broke</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.330" end="00:15:02.089" style="s2">onto the scene he used the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.730" end="00:15:03.980" style="s2">dominance hierarchies quite a bit and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.089" end="00:15:06.770" style="s2">think over time he started to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.980" end="00:15:08.839" style="s2">swap that phrase out for I believe</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.770" end="00:15:10.100" style="s2">competence hierarchies now is that what</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.839" end="00:15:13.130" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of getting at soar the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.100" end="00:15:14.620" style="s2">difference there because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.130" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">pretty clear that we exist in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.620" end="00:15:20.450" style="s2">hierarchy and I&#39;m curious to understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:23.850" style="s2">your perspective on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.450" end="00:15:26.640" style="s2">does that hierarchy start in aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.850" end="00:15:28.380" style="s2">and work its way all the way down to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.640" end="00:15:30.390" style="s2">family level and within our familiar</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.380" end="00:15:33.570" style="s2">relationships with our spouses with our</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.390" end="00:15:35.130" style="s2">children in our community sort of how if</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.570" end="00:15:36.839" style="s2">you can speak to that dominance vs.</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.130" end="00:15:38.580" style="s2">competence is it the same thing is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.839" end="00:15:41.370" style="s2">different and where and where and when</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.580" end="00:15:42.570" style="s2">and how do they start or stop yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.370" end="00:15:44.520" style="s2">think Jack this is a really good</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.570" end="00:15:46.830" style="s2">question and it&#39;s very confusing to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.520" end="00:15:48.839" style="s2">lot of people so on the one hand you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.830" end="00:15:51.990" style="s2">have a social status hierarchy which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.839" end="00:15:54.750" style="s2">within a group who is recognized as</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.990" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">having the highest status second-highest</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.750" end="00:16:00.089" style="s2">etc and people typically agree on this</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:01.710" style="s2">there is a consensus like this person is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.089" end="00:16:04.680" style="s2">more of a leader this person is more of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.710" end="00:16:07.920" style="s2">a quiet follower but separately from</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.680" end="00:16:10.860" style="s2">that there&#39;s a spectrum of competence or</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.920" end="00:16:12.920" style="s2">capability and the main thing Tucker and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.860" end="00:16:15.029" style="s2">I argued in the mate book is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.920" end="00:16:18.660" style="s2">fundamentally women are attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.029" end="00:16:21.240" style="s2">competence even if it doesn&#39;t show up at</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.660" end="00:16:22.740" style="s2">the moment in the state of hierarchy so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.240" end="00:16:23.610" style="s2">if a guy is really good at doing all</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.740" end="00:16:26.820" style="s2">kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.610" end="00:16:30.150" style="s2">hunting fighting taking care of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.820" end="00:16:33.320" style="s2">friends socializing building his</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.150" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">reputation displaying signs of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.320" end="00:16:38.370" style="s2">confidence and capability that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:41.010" style="s2">extremely attractive to most women most</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:43.080" style="s2">of the time and you can do that even if</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.010" end="00:16:45.870" style="s2">you&#39;re not in a kind of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.080" end="00:16:48.600" style="s2">position right you can even do that if</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.870" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">you&#39;re a high school sophomore or of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.600" end="00:16:52.709" style="s2">course you&#39;re not you&#39;re not the top dog</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:55.740" style="s2">because there are juniors and seniors</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.709" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">kind of above you and that&#39;s what we try</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.740" end="00:16:59.550" style="s2">to encourage the young men to do is kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">of don&#39;t worry about your status or your</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.550" end="00:17:05.510" style="s2">dominance first build your confidence</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">get good at lots of things mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.510" end="00:17:09.959" style="s2">this these hierarchies do they do they</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:12.300" style="s2">find them their way into our family</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.959" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">structures as well or are those more</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.300" end="00:17:16.829" style="s2">Galit Arian or how does that work well I</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:18.569" style="s2">think in any given relationship you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.829" end="00:17:21.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a power dynamic where typically</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.569" end="00:17:23.850" style="s2">one person has or ends up with a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.870" end="00:17:25.829" style="s2">bit more power than the other person a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.850" end="00:17:28.620" style="s2">lot of that has to do with relative mate</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.829" end="00:17:30.360" style="s2">value right whoever has a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.620" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">higher made value overall</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.360" end="00:17:36.360" style="s2">whoever has more options has more</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:38.010" style="s2">bargaining power in a relationship if it</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.360" end="00:17:39.570" style="s2">would be easier for them to leave have</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.010" end="00:17:42.150" style="s2">more bargaining power they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.570" end="00:17:44.340" style="s2">more dominant well do you find in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.150" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">research and in your time with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.340" end="00:17:50.670" style="s2">podcast and talking to people that women</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:53.940" style="s2">will willingly enter into a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.670" end="00:17:55.890" style="s2">in which they have higher status or a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.940" end="00:17:59.640" style="s2">higher sort of mate value relative to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.890" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">their male partner and if they do is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.640" end="00:18:05.490" style="s2">satisfying you do see that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:07.140" style="s2">typically the happiest most stable most</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.490" end="00:18:10.169" style="s2">successful relationships have two</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.140" end="00:18:12.929" style="s2">qualities one there&#39;s kind of a division</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.169" end="00:18:15.419" style="s2">of labour with regard to competence so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.929" end="00:18:16.740" style="s2">that the woman might be stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.419" end="00:18:18.510" style="s2">better at certain things the guy</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.740" end="00:18:21.480" style="s2">stronger and better other things and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.510" end="00:18:25.260" style="s2">they complement each other and they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.480" end="00:18:28.230" style="s2">good match in that regard so the guy</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.260" end="00:18:30.390" style="s2">might think oh man she&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.230" end="00:18:33.090" style="s2">dominant to me with regard to certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.390" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">issues but I&#39;m dominant to her with</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.090" end="00:18:38.190" style="s2">regard to other domains of life or other</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.790" end="00:19:07.140" style="s2">think there&#39;s a grain of truth in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">that often women have a lot of kind of</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.750" end="00:19:22.980" style="s2">maybe he&#39;s got stronger political</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.950" end="00:19:24.450" style="s2">opinions or maybe makes the money you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.980" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">know but the woman spends more of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.450" end="00:19:29.580" style="s2">stuff like that mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s in this case it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.580" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">Mirage yeah I think it&#39;s a mirage and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:37.620" style="s2">think smart women throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:40.020" style="s2">have always known that they have quite a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.620" end="00:19:40.890" style="s2">bit more power than their husbands think</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.020" end="00:19:43.290" style="s2">they have</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.890" end="00:19:45.570" style="s2">I heard of I heard a phrase once I said</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.290" end="00:19:49.620" style="s2">the hand that rocks the cradle rules the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.570" end="00:19:52.980" style="s2">world yeah and of course women also have</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.620" end="00:19:55.320" style="s2">a lot of power to shape the abilities</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.980" end="00:20:00.750" style="s2">and and ethics of the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.320" end="00:20:03.720" style="s2">you know as mom&#39;s and as people who kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.750" end="00:20:07.880" style="s2">of set the moral tone for society anyway</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.720" end="00:20:11.750" style="s2">I saw a Pew study that showed that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.880" end="00:20:14.460" style="s2">women&#39;s may preferences are for men with</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.750" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">higher education level and perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.460" end="00:20:21.300" style="s2">higher earning income potential in in</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">the United States now where women</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.300" end="00:20:28.170" style="s2">outnumber men on college campuses I</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:30.150" style="s2">think it&#39;s three to two and growing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.170" end="00:20:31.500" style="s2">fewer and fewer men are getting college</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.150" end="00:20:33.150" style="s2">education more more women are getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.500" end="00:20:34.710" style="s2">college education as I&#39;ve seen studies</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.150" end="00:20:36.930" style="s2">that show that in a hundred and forty</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.710" end="00:20:40.020" style="s2">eight out of 150 metropolitan areas in</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.930" end="00:20:42.350" style="s2">the United States women recent graduates</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.020" end="00:20:45.060" style="s2">are out earning their male counterparts</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.350" end="00:20:47.790" style="s2">how do you see that playing out in terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.060" end="00:20:49.920" style="s2">of mate choice mate selection and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.790" end="00:20:55.500" style="s2">happiness within relationships at cetera</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.920" end="00:20:57.000" style="s2">I think it can be very tough if people</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.500" end="00:20:59.460" style="s2">don&#39;t kind of update their make</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.000" end="00:21:01.050" style="s2">preferences so there&#39;s a tradition in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.460" end="00:21:03.350" style="s2">America of women not wanting to marry</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.050" end="00:21:06.350" style="s2">somebody who makes less than them right</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.350" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">no is that a tradition or is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.350" end="00:21:12.840" style="s2">something that has evolved over time as</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:14.280" style="s2">a way to survive and to evolve you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.840" end="00:21:16.260" style="s2">into the best that they can be I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.280" end="00:21:17.970" style="s2">in a way it is a tradition but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.260" end="00:21:20.580" style="s2">deep tradition I think it goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.970" end="00:21:22.740" style="s2">kind of the invention of agriculture you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.580" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">know ten thousand years ago I think ever</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.740" end="00:21:29.040" style="s2">since then women who have been in groups</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:32.010" style="s2">that did city-states and agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.040" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">inherited land and wealth have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.010" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">under a lot of pressure and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">literal evolutionary selection pressure</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:43.530" style="s2">to do the hypergamy thing to find guys</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:45.870" style="s2">who have land and wealth and an expected</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.530" end="00:21:48.150" style="s2">future stream of wealth and the women</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.870" end="00:21:50.970" style="s2">who didn&#39;t care about that and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.150" end="00:21:53.040" style="s2">groups kind of died out so we&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.970" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">with women who are concerned about is</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.040" end="00:21:56.520" style="s2">10,000 years enough time</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:59.460" style="s2">to make such a change or a dent in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.520" end="00:22:02.340" style="s2">sort of aggregate expression of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.460" end="00:22:04.980" style="s2">genes and preferences sure why not I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.340" end="00:22:07.620" style="s2">mean look at how quickly hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.980" end="00:22:10.770" style="s2">different dog breeds diverged from just</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.620" end="00:22:12.809" style="s2">a few different subspecies of wolves and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.770" end="00:22:14.190" style="s2">last I mean most of those breeds are</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.809" end="00:22:15.750" style="s2">only a few hundred years so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.190" end="00:22:17.250" style="s2">isn&#39;t that like I can touch a controlled</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.750" end="00:22:19.140" style="s2">environment where like humans are</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.250" end="00:22:21.419" style="s2">dictating that evolution that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.140" end="00:22:23.400" style="s2">sort of left to the genetic marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.419" end="00:22:26.070" style="s2">is ten thousand years really enough time</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.400" end="00:22:27.750" style="s2">to make such a profound change and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.070" end="00:22:30.030" style="s2">guess the question I&#39;m asking is does</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.750" end="00:22:33.030" style="s2">this preference go back further than ten</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.030" end="00:22:34.650" style="s2">thousand years yeah if you study you</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.030" end="00:22:36.330" style="s2">know hunter-gatherer tribal societies</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.650" end="00:22:38.340" style="s2">who certainly also see this tendency</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.330" end="00:22:41.419" style="s2">towards hypergamy where the women will</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.340" end="00:22:44.220" style="s2">pay a bit of attention to who&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.419" end="00:22:47.309" style="s2">dominant status prestige who&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.220" end="00:22:50.070" style="s2">hunter if you&#39;re hanging around the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.309" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">campfire at night which guy says things</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.070" end="00:22:55.740" style="s2">that everybody else listens to versus</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:57.210" style="s2">which guys don&#39;t say anything or you</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.740" end="00:22:59.370" style="s2">know say dumb stuff that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.210" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">ignores they pay a lot of attention to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.370" end="00:23:06.059" style="s2">that of course but I think the focus on</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:08.120" style="s2">wealth is perhaps relatively new and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.059" end="00:23:11.270" style="s2">think we should distinguish between like</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.120" end="00:23:13.830" style="s2">hunting ability is one thing but making</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.270" end="00:23:16.169" style="s2">you know a professional living in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.830" end="00:23:19.260" style="s2">complex market economy is a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.169" end="00:23:23.960" style="s2">thing right so it seems it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.260" end="00:23:27.330" style="s2">that female reaction to a successful</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.960" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">expression of like physicality is is</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.330" end="00:23:32.970" style="s2">maybe in a instinctual response whereas</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:36.390" style="s2">reaction to your wealth and income may</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.970" end="00:23:38.429" style="s2">be calculated well I think they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.390" end="00:23:40.580" style="s2">instinctual responses one just goes back</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.429" end="00:23:44.309" style="s2">further than the other mmm-hmm I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.580" end="00:23:46.260" style="s2">you know females of almost all species</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.309" end="00:23:49.470" style="s2">that we&#39;ve studied generally have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.260" end="00:23:51.660" style="s2">tendency to prefer to mate with males</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.470" end="00:23:55.110" style="s2">that are physically larger stronger</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.660" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">healthier more energetic more capable</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.110" end="00:24:00.300" style="s2">than their female counterpart or them</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:02.970" style="s2">that other matters than other males</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.300" end="00:24:05.550" style="s2">right yeah so what happens to this</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.970" end="00:24:08.550" style="s2">mating process the sorting process when</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.550" end="00:24:10.650" style="s2">you have fewer and fewer men you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.550" end="00:24:12.180" style="s2">attaining you know higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.650" end="00:24:15.090" style="s2">education and income and then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.180" end="00:24:18.060" style="s2">combine it with a popular culture that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">seems to be denigrating masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.060" end="00:24:24.780" style="s2">male performance what is that going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.820" end="00:24:27.480" style="s2">do to the innate wiring of 22 year old</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.780" end="00:24:29.910" style="s2">woman today who is trying to find her</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.480" end="00:24:31.950" style="s2">place in the mating market but you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.910" end="00:24:33.390" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a contradiction from what</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.950" end="00:24:34.860" style="s2">she&#39;s seeing culturally than what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.390" end="00:24:36.510" style="s2">feeling on the inside but yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.860" end="00:24:38.940" style="s2">great question if I was a 22 year old</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.510" end="00:24:40.650" style="s2">woman in in modern society I imagine I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.940" end="00:24:42.600" style="s2">would be really really frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.650" end="00:24:44.700" style="s2">because I would have these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.600" end="00:24:46.350" style="s2">instinctual attractions to certain male</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.700" end="00:24:49.740" style="s2">traits that are in relatively short</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.350" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">supply partly due the you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.740" end="00:24:54.980" style="s2">technology and the economy and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:57.480" style="s2">culture and so forth but I would also be</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.980" end="00:24:58.860" style="s2">kind of feeling guilty about having</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.480" end="00:25:01.860" style="s2">those preferences where does that come</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.860" end="00:25:04.560" style="s2">from I think it&#39;s from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.860" end="00:25:07.470" style="s2">politically correct ideology and gender</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.560" end="00:25:11.000" style="s2">feminism that says you should be going</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.470" end="00:25:13.770" style="s2">for men who aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.000" end="00:25:16.350" style="s2">physically strong and capable but are</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.770" end="00:25:19.080" style="s2">just nice and allies that you should go</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.350" end="00:25:22.260" style="s2">for men who have the right ethical</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.080" end="00:25:24.510" style="s2">values rather than necessarily the best</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.260" end="00:25:27.890" style="s2">future earners or the ones who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.510" end="00:25:32.100" style="s2">socially a professionally competent and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.890" end="00:25:33.810" style="s2">and so men aren&#39;t living up to women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.100" end="00:25:35.550" style="s2">standards but also I think women aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.810" end="00:25:39.240" style="s2">being very articulate about what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.550" end="00:25:40.740" style="s2">really wanting really when when you say</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.240" end="00:25:43.080" style="s2">that the first thing I think of a Sheryl</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.740" end="00:25:44.310" style="s2">Sandberg and her book where she says</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.080" end="00:25:46.170" style="s2">they you know you should date all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.310" end="00:25:47.370" style="s2">bad boys and have fun with them until</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.170" end="00:25:49.020" style="s2">you&#39;re ready to settle down and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.370" end="00:25:51.180" style="s2">find yourself a good little earner I</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.020" end="00:25:55.140" style="s2">mean that to me seems to be pretty darn</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.180" end="00:25:59.010" style="s2">explicit I think that&#39;s not the worst</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.140" end="00:26:00.450" style="s2">advice I&#39;ve heard but for the guy I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.010" end="00:26:01.830" style="s2">that so this is I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.450" end="00:26:04.680" style="s2">something that people are really feeling</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.830" end="00:26:08.340" style="s2">right now which is there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.680" end="00:26:10.650" style="s2">for between being desired by your mate</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.340" end="00:26:12.179" style="s2">for urinate physicality or your</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.650" end="00:26:15.149" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.179" end="00:26:18.330" style="s2">or you&#39;re just you know brutishness as</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.149" end="00:26:20.789" style="s2">it were versus being perceived as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.330" end="00:26:24.059" style="s2">valuable business partner and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.789" end="00:26:26.250" style="s2">valuable for your sort of economic or</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.059" end="00:26:28.889" style="s2">contribution to the relationship and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.250" end="00:26:32.850" style="s2">think that the former makes people feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.889" end="00:26:34.049" style="s2">like you know with increased vitality it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.850" end="00:26:38.279" style="s2">makes them feel excited it makes them</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.049" end="00:26:40.380" style="s2">feel awesome but to be the guy who gets</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:48.269" style="s2">like oh the good dad or the good earner</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.870" end="00:26:51.149" style="s2">could provide her good partner I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.269" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">that makes guys feel kind of used yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.149" end="00:26:55.230" style="s2">alters that I mean men are status</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.980" end="00:26:56.970" style="s2">objects and women are sex objects and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.230" end="00:26:59.159" style="s2">neither of us like to be treated as</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.970" end="00:27:02.700" style="s2">objects in that kind of way and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.159" end="00:27:05.370" style="s2">what a transactional way but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.700" end="00:27:07.799" style="s2">thing is that you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.370" end="00:27:10.440" style="s2">difference between and what guys get</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.799" end="00:27:14.100" style="s2">very confused about this like you&#39;re big</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.440" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">strong guy and and some guys are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.100" end="00:27:19.769" style="s2">born that way though that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">genetics but whatever you&#39;re your genes</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.769" end="00:27:23.820" style="s2">are it&#39;s like not that hard to stay in</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.820" end="00:27:30.809" style="s2">bit and you don&#39;t have to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.539" end="00:27:32.669" style="s2">the strongest MMA fighter on campus to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.809" end="00:27:35.519" style="s2">be attractive to women I think women are</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.669" end="00:27:38.610" style="s2">often just looking for a certain basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.519" end="00:27:41.630" style="s2">minimum level of literal physical</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.610" end="00:27:44.190" style="s2">fitness I&#39;m like if you&#39;re fit enough to</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.620" end="00:27:57.779" style="s2">reaching that standard no definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:28:01.080" style="s2">and I think that what we&#39;ve seen is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.779" end="00:28:02.669" style="s2">the importance for you know keeping</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.080" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">yourself in good shape and for just</p>

<p begin="00:28:18.120" end="00:28:22.690" style="s2">saying like general dissatisfaction but</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.190" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">I think your experience with the power</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.430" end="00:28:39.490" style="s2">disenchantment people are disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.020" end="00:28:42.730" style="s2">things aren&#39;t working the way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.490" end="00:28:43.900" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to work and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.730" end="00:28:47.380" style="s2">it&#39;s because we&#39;re giving people the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.900" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">wrong messages and we&#39;re also building a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.380" end="00:28:53.410" style="s2">society in which women are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:56.500" style="s2">building themselves up into a situation</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.410" end="00:28:59.260" style="s2">which other men are just gonna just fail</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.500" end="00:29:02.770" style="s2">them if they&#39;re just not gonna generate</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.260" end="00:29:04.140" style="s2">that innate sexual desire and and I you</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.770" end="00:29:06.820" style="s2">know I keep coming back to that because</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.140" end="00:29:08.560" style="s2">for me personally I I was in a marriage</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.820" end="00:29:10.300" style="s2">that was that was just crashed and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.560" end="00:29:12.460" style="s2">burned and I had fallen apart I were</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.300" end="00:29:15.220" style="s2">gotten fat and I was out of shape and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.460" end="00:29:18.070" style="s2">was drinking too much and I wasn&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.220" end="00:29:20.800" style="s2">anything that would generate desire from</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.070" end="00:29:22.540" style="s2">my from my ex-wife and once I got</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.800" end="00:29:23.680" style="s2">divorced I realized I wasn&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.540" end="00:29:26.680" style="s2">anything that was going to generate</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.680" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">desire in anybody right so I figured out</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.680" end="00:29:30.040" style="s2">through trial and error that I had to</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:32.230" style="s2">like get my ass in shape and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.040" end="00:29:34.300" style="s2">work out and I had to become physically</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.230" end="00:29:36.610" style="s2">fit and physically dominant and carry</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.300" end="00:29:39.040" style="s2">myself in a way that that exude that if</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.610" end="00:29:40.810" style="s2">irrespective of whatever my intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.040" end="00:29:43.000" style="s2">capabilities were my professional</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.810" end="00:29:45.640" style="s2">capabilities and that was a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.000" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">lesson to learn because I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.640" end="00:29:50.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of entitlement out there</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:51.670" style="s2">with with guys and you know they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.020" end="00:29:54.160" style="s2">put it together yet that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.670" end="00:29:55.690" style="s2">like all on them and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.160" end="00:29:57.310" style="s2">that&#39;s my main message that I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.690" end="00:29:59.530" style="s2">to guys which is that it&#39;s all on you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.310" end="00:30:01.270" style="s2">and that you you have the capability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.530" end="00:30:04.600" style="s2">make make a change in your life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.270" end="00:30:07.030" style="s2">going to manifest itself and better</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.600" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">healthier more satisfying relationships</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.030" end="00:30:11.620" style="s2">with both your significant others and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:15.730" style="s2">just your friends and people around you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.620" end="00:30:17.680" style="s2">and where is that message today and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.730" end="00:30:20.470" style="s2">mean the weird thing is I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.680" end="00:30:21.880" style="s2">everything you just said um people think</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.470" end="00:30:24.370" style="s2">of this as kind of a marginal issue</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.880" end="00:30:26.980" style="s2">compared to like oh the the election or</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.370" end="00:30:30.610" style="s2">whatever but actually a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.980" end="00:30:33.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t offer a viable mating</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.610" end="00:30:34.740" style="s2">market and that doesn&#39;t offer norms and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.280" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">standards and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.740" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">you know habits and institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:43.170" style="s2">allow young men to meet young women and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">get together and have relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.170" end="00:30:46.800" style="s2">have babies and have families that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:48.270" style="s2">failed civilization right and and not</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.800" end="00:30:51.390" style="s2">just get together and have babies but</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.270" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">have long lasting satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.390" end="00:30:56.130" style="s2">relationships because it seems it seems</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:58.490" style="s2">to be a phenomenon where people can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.130" end="00:31:01.590" style="s2">together in the chemical lusts</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.490" end="00:31:03.270" style="s2">passionate period of love and and have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:04.980" style="s2">baby but then like two or three years</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.270" end="00:31:06.420" style="s2">later they realize you know like our</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.980" end="00:31:08.400" style="s2">triggers aren&#39;t being hit here and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.420" end="00:31:10.260" style="s2">nobody&#39;s happy and there&#39;s a lot of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.400" end="00:31:12.179" style="s2">lot of divorce like around around that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.260" end="00:31:13.950" style="s2">time I don&#39;t have any hard statistics on</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.179" end="00:31:17.070" style="s2">it but anecdotally I have seen it I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.950" end="00:31:18.870" style="s2">experienced it myself it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.070" end="00:31:22.260" style="s2">you know you you&#39;re absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.870" end="00:31:24.870" style="s2">about a society that fails to to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.260" end="00:31:28.770" style="s2">clear the mating market is a doomed</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.870" end="00:31:30.929" style="s2">Society in the long run and I first my</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.770" end="00:31:32.970" style="s2">book Democrats a deplorable it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.929" end="00:31:35.340" style="s2">politics and culture but I started</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.970" end="00:31:36.630" style="s2">writing about relationship issues just</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.340" end="00:31:37.950" style="s2">like this you know and through my own</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.630" end="00:31:39.330" style="s2">personal experience I mean everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.950" end="00:31:40.770" style="s2">that I&#39;ve written about has been through</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:49.800" style="s2">happened to me in the past and and put</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.360" end="00:31:53.160" style="s2">that out there for people in a raw and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.800" end="00:31:55.470" style="s2">honest way and in doing that I realized</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.160" end="00:31:58.020" style="s2">that the issues that were affecting our</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.470" end="00:31:59.160" style="s2">our dating and mating markets and</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.550" end="00:32:14.280" style="s2">you know gonna shift subject here just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.710" end="00:32:16.679" style="s2">little bit but it came down to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.280" end="00:32:18.900" style="s2">this radical feminism and modern</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.679" end="00:32:21.300" style="s2">feminism today and sort of this desire</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.330" end="00:33:08.900" style="s2">scholar could track tracked out all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.370" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">way back into the feminist literature</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.900" end="00:33:16.730" style="s2">but to see it burst forth onto the</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">biggest national platform that there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.730" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">you know this court Supreme Court</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:25.580" style="s2">hearings and the presidents involved and</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:26.840" style="s2">it really hammered home to me that all</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.580" end="00:33:29.149" style="s2">these things that I&#39;ve been discovering</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.840" end="00:33:30.890" style="s2">through trial and error were not insane</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.149" end="00:33:32.990" style="s2">right and I&#39;m not crazy</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.890" end="00:33:36.020" style="s2">and this stuff is real and it&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.669" end="00:33:41.419" style="s2">really you know I think if we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.950" end="00:33:43.340" style="s2">something about it it&#39;s gonna have some</p>

<p begin="00:33:43.340" end="00:33:48.140" style="s2">you know what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.159" end="00:33:49.850" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re at a peak of of mistrust</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.140" end="00:33:52.130" style="s2">between the sexes and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.850" end="00:33:53.960" style="s2">completely that&#39;s the real toxicity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.130" end="00:33:57.020" style="s2">not toxic masculinity it&#39;s toxic</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.960" end="00:33:59.980" style="s2">mistrust and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s fed by</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.020" end="00:34:03.010" style="s2">kind of media and academic culture that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.980" end="00:34:06.500" style="s2">exaggerated Samara cos problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.010" end="00:34:09.859" style="s2">extremely like the rate of you know rape</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.500" end="00:34:12.230" style="s2">in America&#39;s fallen by at least half or</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.859" end="00:34:15.109" style="s2">maybe three times compared to the early</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.230" end="00:34:17.179" style="s2">90s oh yeah I mean the chart is just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.109" end="00:34:18.500" style="s2">steady downward joke there&#39;s a doubt as</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.179" end="00:34:21.139" style="s2">far back as you can look and and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.500" end="00:34:23.210" style="s2">overall level like in the u.s. compared</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.139" end="00:34:27.770" style="s2">to like India has a real great problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.210" end="00:34:30.290" style="s2">India is very sexist patriarchal porn is</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.770" end="00:34:33.050" style="s2">outlawed you know young men are sexually</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.290" end="00:34:36.050" style="s2">frustrated there&#39;s not a culture of sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.050" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">of casual sex etc so they have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.050" end="00:34:39.649" style="s2">problem of sexual coercion there is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:44.419" style="s2">big problem of sexual coercion in</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.649" end="00:34:47.990" style="s2">America but it&#39;s gradually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.419" end="00:34:50.990" style="s2">fading away for various reasons but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.990" end="00:34:53.300" style="s2">more overblown it is by the media the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.990" end="00:34:54.490" style="s2">harder it is for young people to go on</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.300" end="00:34:56.859" style="s2">dates and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.490" end="00:34:58.869" style="s2">but is it just the media that&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.859" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">blowing it I mean I went to I went to</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.869" end="00:35:03.730" style="s2">the the protests out in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">Supreme Court and there was a woman up</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.730" end="00:35:09.580" style="s2">there so she was an executive director</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">of rape ed on campus and she said one in</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.580" end="00:35:15.030" style="s2">three women on campus will be victims of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:17.859" style="s2">sexual violence this year now I</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.030" end="00:35:20.290" style="s2">understand that they have taken the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.859" end="00:35:22.839" style="s2">surveys and the the questions they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.290" end="00:35:25.390" style="s2">expanded what it means to be a victim of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.839" end="00:35:28.420" style="s2">sexual assault and it&#39;s really a you</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.390" end="00:35:30.099" style="s2">know down now even if you looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.420" end="00:35:31.300" style="s2">wrong way but I&#39;m exaggerating here but</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.099" end="00:35:35.500" style="s2">basically they expanded the definition</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.300" end="00:35:37.390" style="s2">and you know these studies used the big</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.500" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">scare number was one in five and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.390" end="00:35:39.460" style="s2">was one in four and now it&#39;s one in</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:43.450" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.460" end="00:35:45.940" style="s2">so it&#39;s the is the read of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.450" end="00:35:48.700" style="s2">violence on college campus has it really</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.940" end="00:35:52.030" style="s2">gone up that much to one in three I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.700" end="00:35:54.790" style="s2">if this was a real number would you or</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.030" end="00:35:56.830" style="s2">any other father in America send your</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.790" end="00:35:58.510" style="s2">daughter to a college campus and so this</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.830" end="00:36:01.720" style="s2">hysteria is not just from the media it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.510" end="00:36:03.369" style="s2">from these are nonprofits these are</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.720" end="00:36:05.890" style="s2">people well yeah answer advocacy groups</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.369" end="00:36:07.330" style="s2">these advocacy groups nonprofits that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.890" end="00:36:09.490" style="s2">often have a vested interest in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.330" end="00:36:10.630" style="s2">overblowing these statistics but this I</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.490" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">mean this is generally true for</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.630" end="00:36:15.190" style="s2">nonprofits right like World Wildlife</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:17.560" style="s2">Fund will exaggerate the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.190" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">extinction and Greenpeace will</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.560" end="00:36:22.210" style="s2">exaggerate the rate of global warming I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:24.369" style="s2">mean of course everybody who has a sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.210" end="00:36:27.310" style="s2">of vested interest and a problem wants</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.369" end="00:36:29.650" style="s2">to make the problem seem really big but</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.310" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">the best statistics show you know rates</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.650" end="00:36:34.450" style="s2">of sexual coercion are dropping on</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:36.250" style="s2">campuses and it&#39;s much safer for a young</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.450" end="00:36:39.099" style="s2">woman to be on a campus or not to be on</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.250" end="00:36:42.820" style="s2">a campus and that message is getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.099" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">lost and also I think that there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.820" end="00:36:48.670" style="s2">an expanded definition of what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:50.740" style="s2">relationships between men and women are</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.670" end="00:36:52.240" style="s2">problematic like for example the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.740" end="00:36:56.440" style="s2">that if you&#39;re tipsy</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t give any consent a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.440" end="00:37:00.849" style="s2">one-in-three stats are basically women</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.410" style="s2">who hook up when they&#39;re tipsy because</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.849" end="00:37:03.950" style="s2">it&#39;s considered to be sexually</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:07.970" style="s2">course--it if there</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.950" end="00:37:09.140" style="s2">you know tipsy um and what I found</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.970" end="00:37:10.700" style="s2">interesting about those studies is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.140" end="00:37:13.550" style="s2">at the end they ask oh did you report</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.700" end="00:37:15.020" style="s2">this and they don&#39;t do people those self</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.550" end="00:37:16.550" style="s2">reporters on these tests and these</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.020" end="00:37:17.780" style="s2">quizzes say they don&#39;t report them and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.550" end="00:37:19.220" style="s2">why didn&#39;t they report them because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.780" end="00:37:20.570" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel like it was sexual violence</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.220" end="00:37:22.310" style="s2">but then the people who are doing my</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.570" end="00:37:24.740" style="s2">study the researchers say oh it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.310" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">sexual yes right exactly and that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.740" end="00:37:28.730" style="s2">asked my own University like okay what</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:30.920" style="s2">exactly is our policy let&#39;s say a two</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.730" end="00:37:33.050" style="s2">gay guys two gay students get together</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.920" end="00:37:35.510" style="s2">and they both tipsy and they have sex</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.050" end="00:37:37.370" style="s2">who raped who or did they both rape each</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.510" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">other or was it not rape the coordinator</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.370" end="00:37:41.720" style="s2">or our policies and there is no answer</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:43.490" style="s2">for that right and that seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.720" end="00:37:44.750" style="s2">seems like we must be living in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.490" end="00:37:46.790" style="s2">sort of bizarre world where that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.750" end="00:37:49.160" style="s2">actually becomes a valid question but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.790" end="00:37:52.910" style="s2">is a valid question and in the context</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.160" end="00:37:56.150" style="s2">of seeing the Supreme Court hearing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.910" end="00:37:58.040" style="s2">dominated by these ideas it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.150" end="00:37:59.750" style="s2">just a fringe thing to think about I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.040" end="00:38:01.700" style="s2">don&#39;t think I say I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.750" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">now in the mainstream it&#39;s affecting our</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.700" end="00:38:06.260" style="s2">government it&#39;s affecting our culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:08.300" style="s2">it&#39;s affecting us and on aggregate and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.260" end="00:38:10.700" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna affect our mating and mating</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.300" end="00:38:13.700" style="s2">sorting and our genetic development so</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.700" end="00:38:15.590" style="s2">this to me is you know it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.700" end="00:38:16.940" style="s2">think it&#39;s an existential problem but</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.590" end="00:38:18.170" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s approaching that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.940" end="00:38:20.210" style="s2">mean this is something that I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.170" end="00:38:22.850" style="s2">needs a lot more attention and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.210" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">solution what what do you think we do</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.850" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">about this well you know look if if</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.020" end="00:38:31.700" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:34.430" style="s2">government policy at economic level the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.700" end="00:38:36.290" style="s2">first thing to ask from like my</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.430" end="00:38:38.120" style="s2">libertarian perspective is what could be</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.120" end="00:38:43.030" style="s2">side effects of the policy or how will</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:45.950" style="s2">people respond to the new incentives in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.030" end="00:38:48.380" style="s2">ways he might not have predicted and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.950" end="00:38:50.390" style="s2">that might be counterproductive people</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.380" end="00:38:53.270" style="s2">don&#39;t tend to do that when they get in</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.390" end="00:38:55.100" style="s2">the sexual realm of talking about well</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.270" end="00:38:57.770" style="s2">we should adopt these sexual norms and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.100" end="00:38:59.390" style="s2">values they don&#39;t typically ask okay if</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.770" end="00:39:01.970" style="s2">we do that what are the unanticipated</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.390" end="00:39:04.210" style="s2">side effects like if you have new</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.970" end="00:39:06.350" style="s2">policies on campus that basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.210" end="00:39:07.220" style="s2">disincentivize students from dating</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.350" end="00:39:10.490" style="s2">other students</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.220" end="00:39:13.250" style="s2">well okay they&#39;ll date non students or</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.490" end="00:39:15.590" style="s2">they won&#39;t date at all and maybe become</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.250" end="00:39:17.780" style="s2">frustrated and depressed so what are</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.590" end="00:39:21.260" style="s2">those costs nobody seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.780" end="00:39:23.420" style="s2">skank those kinds of questions um but I</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.260" end="00:39:25.400" style="s2">see it like when I teach my human</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.420" end="00:39:27.230" style="s2">sexuality class I&#39;ll sometimes ask the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.400" end="00:39:29.960" style="s2">students how how do you guys feel all</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.230" end="00:39:31.640" style="s2">about dating somebody else on campus and</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.960" end="00:39:35.330" style="s2">a lot of the guys will say I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.640" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">dare it is too risky why the hell would</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.330" end="00:39:43.220" style="s2">I - the risk of somebody misinterpreting</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:46.070" style="s2">something or or having regrets about a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.220" end="00:39:48.050" style="s2">date or a sexual experience and and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.070" end="00:39:50.750" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re basically deterred from</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.050" end="00:39:53.030" style="s2">forming relationships and when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.750" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">college in the 80s there&#39;s like we had</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.030" end="00:39:59.570" style="s2">relationship problems but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:40:02.810" style="s2">worry about the university kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.570" end="00:40:05.030" style="s2">like this draconian rule enforcer no cuz</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.810" end="00:40:06.950" style="s2">they just spent the 60s and 70s kicking</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.030" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">the universities out of the dormitory</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.950" end="00:40:10.970" style="s2">bedrooms right yeah they said we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:13.580" style="s2">want in loco parentis we don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.970" end="00:40:15.530" style="s2">universities to take the place of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.580" end="00:40:17.660" style="s2">know parents and our dating lives we</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.530" end="00:40:21.230" style="s2">want sexual freedom right now we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.660" end="00:40:23.570" style="s2">basically lost all that well I see this</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.230" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">as a major issue facing us culturally</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.570" end="00:40:29.960" style="s2">and politically and in my research and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:32.090" style="s2">my experiences I&#39;ve seen I would tie</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.960" end="00:40:35.030" style="s2">this back although back to title nine</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.090" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">regulations and back to the Obama era</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.030" end="00:40:40.190" style="s2">changes to the sexual harassment</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:42.590" style="s2">policies and procedures and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.190" end="00:40:44.900" style="s2">it was Joe Biden in particular who got</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.590" end="00:40:46.910" style="s2">you know sort of convinced by some</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.900" end="00:40:50.180" style="s2">radical feminists that this was one in</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.910" end="00:40:51.740" style="s2">fun what&#39;s fun in five then that the one</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.180" end="00:40:53.960" style="s2">in five number was really real and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.740" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">was a rape epidemic right this was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.960" end="00:40:58.130" style="s2">national crisis that needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:40:59.660" style="s2">handled and so from Washington and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.130" end="00:41:01.670" style="s2">working in education too so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.660" end="00:41:04.030" style="s2">familiar with the way that&#39;s a federal</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.670" end="00:41:06.710" style="s2">policy education policy tied to money</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.030" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">can manifest itself in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.710" end="00:41:10.760" style="s2">society and our relationships and change</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:13.400" style="s2">human behavior and so the way I see it</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.760" end="00:41:14.840" style="s2">is that there&#39;s like this web reaching</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.400" end="00:41:17.750" style="s2">out from Washington DC that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.840" end="00:41:19.250" style="s2">politically motivated that then changed</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.750" end="00:41:21.620" style="s2">the incentive structure for universities</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.250" end="00:41:23.360" style="s2">across camp across the country who under</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.620" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">the threat of losing their money have</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.360" end="00:41:28.220" style="s2">now expanded you know if not not just</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:29.600" style="s2">from like preventing women from being</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.220" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">harassed to the point that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.600" end="00:41:32.580" style="s2">get their education</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:34.710" style="s2">but now they have to actually stamp out</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.580" end="00:41:37.590" style="s2">any sense of harassment sort of before</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.710" end="00:41:39.030" style="s2">it happens I think something like 250</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.590" end="00:41:40.830" style="s2">colleges across the country of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.030" end="00:41:43.260" style="s2">things called bias response teams where</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.830" end="00:41:44.430" style="s2">year you know students are instructed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.260" end="00:41:46.290" style="s2">rat on each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.430" end="00:41:47.610" style="s2">somebody says anything that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.290" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">offensive you know and these things</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.610" end="00:41:51.420" style="s2">sound absolutely insane if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:53.010" style="s2">sort of sticking your toe into this</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.420" end="00:41:55.110" style="s2">conversation for the first time but</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.010" end="00:41:58.650" style="s2">these are facts I mean this is real</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.110" end="00:42:01.530" style="s2">stuff and so to me I see it as being all</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.650" end="00:42:03.330" style="s2">politically related and I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.530" end="00:42:06.200" style="s2">have like sort of a new crisis on our</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.330" end="00:42:09.270" style="s2">hands in in instead of the fake crisis</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.200" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">then again it comes from the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.270" end="00:42:15.480" style="s2">policies and the sort of infiltration of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:19.860" style="s2">radical feminism into the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.480" end="00:42:22.080" style="s2">Party and so to me it looks like a major</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.860" end="00:42:24.300" style="s2">national issue the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.080" end="00:42:27.410" style="s2">kids in your classes that say that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.300" end="00:42:31.260" style="s2">won&#39;t date each other on campus so how</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.410" end="00:42:33.060" style="s2">how do you how do i how do we how do my</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.260" end="00:42:34.890" style="s2">listeners how do my readers what do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.060" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">do about this like how do we make these</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.890" end="00:42:39.480" style="s2">changes cuz I&#39;ll be honest I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:42.300" style="s2">practically a single-issue voter with</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.480" end="00:42:45.240" style="s2">Donald Trump when he when he you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.300" end="00:42:48.090" style="s2">alluded to making title nine reforms and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.240" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">my just big hopes that he was gonna you</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.090" end="00:42:53.910" style="s2">know that to me was such a high leverage</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:55.470" style="s2">issue that you know that sort of sealed</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.910" end="00:42:57.660" style="s2">it for me so what&#39;s your take on that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.470" end="00:42:59.369" style="s2">hmm I think it is important for</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.660" end="00:43:02.220" style="s2">listeners to understand that virtually</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.369" end="00:43:05.010" style="s2">all of the ideological pressure on</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.220" end="00:43:07.470" style="s2">campuses comes from the left not from</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.010" end="00:43:09.600" style="s2">the right if it came from the right I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.470" end="00:43:12.090" style="s2">would not have been able to teach a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.600" end="00:43:15.390" style="s2">class on polyamory and open sexuality I</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.090" end="00:43:18.090" style="s2">would be terrified of what I teach in my</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.390" end="00:43:19.800" style="s2">regular human sexuality class in terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.090" end="00:43:21.720" style="s2">of potential conservative blowback</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.800" end="00:43:23.400" style="s2">because I cover a lot of kind of edgy</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.720" end="00:43:27.000" style="s2">topics you know I cover the history of</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.400" end="00:43:29.250" style="s2">gay rights I cover kink and BDSM I cover</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.000" end="00:43:33.080" style="s2">hypergamy I cover a lot of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.250" end="00:43:35.160" style="s2">that many American conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.080" end="00:43:38.550" style="s2">particularly you know Christian</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.160" end="00:43:39.780" style="s2">conservatives would find like then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.550" end="00:43:40.450" style="s2">they don&#39;t want their kids to hear about</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.780" end="00:43:43.930" style="s2">that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.450" end="00:43:46.690" style="s2">but they have no voice nobody in higher</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.930" end="00:43:48.940" style="s2">education administration is listening to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.690" end="00:43:51.070" style="s2">Christian conservatives about what their</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.940" end="00:43:51.520" style="s2">complaints are they are listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.070" end="00:43:55.349" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.520" end="00:43:58.060" style="s2">darrel listening to gender feminists so</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.349" end="00:44:00.820" style="s2">this isn&#39;t just an issue of you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.060" end="00:44:03.510" style="s2">dating on campus it&#39;s also an issue of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.820" end="00:44:05.980" style="s2">what our professor is allowed to teach</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.510" end="00:44:07.930" style="s2">because remember title 9 originally was</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.980" end="00:44:12.070" style="s2">about equal access basically to college</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.930" end="00:44:15.180" style="s2">athletics now it&#39;s turned into extremely</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.070" end="00:44:19.000" style="s2">strong constraints on free speech</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.180" end="00:44:20.829" style="s2">because a lot of policy a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.000" end="00:44:24.550" style="s2">universities have policies now that say</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.829" end="00:44:27.609" style="s2">if you say anything that any student</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.550" end="00:44:30.369" style="s2">considers to be sexist or stereotyping</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.609" end="00:44:33.660" style="s2">they can report it to administrators and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.369" end="00:44:37.060" style="s2">then you as a faculty member can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.660" end="00:44:39.160" style="s2">censured and you know punished because</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.060" end="00:44:42.820" style="s2">he or whatever saying something sexist</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.160" end="00:44:45.609" style="s2">okay how do you define that it could</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.820" end="00:44:47.190" style="s2">potentially be any scientific claim</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.609" end="00:44:50.349" style="s2">about sex differences</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.190" end="00:44:52.450" style="s2">well the James d&#39;amore Google memo issue</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.349" end="00:44:53.859" style="s2">came up and you know I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.450" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">assume basic understanding from our</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.859" end="00:44:58.510" style="s2">audience on what happened there but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:45:02.200" style="s2">national labor review board when they</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.510" end="00:45:04.750" style="s2">went over the complaint there in their</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.200" end="00:45:07.990" style="s2">response they said that any discussion</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.990" end="00:45:14.050" style="s2">aptitude capabilities was considered</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.930" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">harassment yeah and that&#39;s where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.050" end="00:45:18.670" style="s2">at as America and it&#39;s insane because</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">the amount of scientific evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.670" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">those differences is very strong you</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:24.630" style="s2">know it&#39;s at least as strong as the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:28.450" style="s2">evidence for let&#39;s say a global warming</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.630" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">but one of those issues there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.450" end="00:45:35.349" style="s2">there&#39;s a line that we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:38.829" style="s2">follow that Mithen point right well</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.349" end="00:45:40.780" style="s2">which makes me laugh because the folks</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.829" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">on the left will say that the people on</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.780" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">the right are science deniers but when</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">it comes to gender and sexuality and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:49.000" style="s2">whatnot that it&#39;s definitely people on</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:52.589" style="s2">the left that are the science deniers</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.000" end="00:45:54.910" style="s2">here absolutely yeah the left tends to</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.589" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">often believe in kind of blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.910" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">views and basically deny the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:00.730" style="s2">of human would you do you explain that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:02.109" style="s2">concept for people that are listening</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.730" end="00:46:04.599" style="s2">please because I think this is really</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.109" end="00:46:06.310" style="s2">crucial and also to like our political</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.599" end="00:46:08.770" style="s2">coalition&#39;s I think that we&#39;re sorting</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.310" end="00:46:11.260" style="s2">around this idea actually okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.770" end="00:46:12.910" style="s2">blank slate is the view that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.260" end="00:46:14.410" style="s2">may have shaped our bodies to have human</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.910" end="00:46:16.329" style="s2">form but it didn&#39;t really have any</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.410" end="00:46:18.760" style="s2">significant effect on our minds other</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.329" end="00:46:21.550" style="s2">than just endow us with a general</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.760" end="00:46:23.710" style="s2">purpose learning capacity that means we</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.550" end="00:46:26.260" style="s2">can soak up ideas from culture and from</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.710" end="00:46:29.050" style="s2">other people so if you&#39;re a blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.260" end="00:46:31.270" style="s2">er then you believe that very few</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.050" end="00:46:34.210" style="s2">psychological traits are heritable in</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.270" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">the sense that you know individuals will</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.210" end="00:46:39.339" style="s2">resemble their parents for genetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:41.260" style="s2">rather than just cultural reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.339" end="00:46:43.240" style="s2">also you don&#39;t tend to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.260" end="00:46:46.030" style="s2">there are significant evolved</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.240" end="00:46:47.470" style="s2">differences between the sexes you tend</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.030" end="00:46:49.900" style="s2">to believe there aren&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.470" end="00:46:51.570" style="s2">heritable personality traits you tend</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.900" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">not to believe there&#39;s such a thing as</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.570" end="00:46:56.310" style="s2">general intelligence that&#39;s heritable</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:59.770" style="s2">and the difference between people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.310" end="00:47:02.980" style="s2">the left has basically always been the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.770" end="00:47:07.230" style="s2">side of blank slate er is because they</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.980" end="00:47:11.829" style="s2">want people to be naturally good and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.230" end="00:47:17.170" style="s2">perfectible preferably through state</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.829" end="00:47:19.180" style="s2">intervention and they really don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.170" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">to think about any innate differences</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.180" end="00:47:26.609" style="s2">between people or between species or</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:30.280" style="s2">between the sexes but this is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.609" end="00:47:32.020" style="s2">contradicted by by a datum yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.280" end="00:47:33.910" style="s2">you know I think Steven Pinker&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.020" end="00:47:35.589" style="s2">book it&#39;s called the blank slate and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.910" end="00:47:38.530" style="s2">should read it if you believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.589" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">blank slate it will tear your mind a new</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.530" end="00:47:48.119" style="s2">opening into reality no they&#39;ll just set</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:50.530" style="s2">it on fire so burn it it&#39;s heresy but</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.119" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">what&#39;s amazing about that book is it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.530" end="00:47:57.240" style="s2">written I think in 2002 and when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:58.830" style="s2">read it today</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.240" end="00:48:02.160" style="s2">it seems like because I read it again</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.830" end="00:48:04.170" style="s2">just like a year ago and see it reads</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:07.890" style="s2">like case closed</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.170" end="00:48:09.960" style="s2">yeah right like blank blank slate is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.890" end="00:48:13.110" style="s2">no does not exist period end of story</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.960" end="00:48:15.060" style="s2">next discussion but in the preface to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.110" end="00:48:16.440" style="s2">the latest edition and he&#39;s like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.060" end="00:48:18.690" style="s2">believe we&#39;re still having this debate</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.440" end="00:48:20.670" style="s2">and I can&#39;t believe that this is still</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.690" end="00:48:23.100" style="s2">an issue and I would argue that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.670" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">even more pronounced than it was 15 15</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.100" end="00:48:27.660" style="s2">years ago yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:30.300" style="s2">it&#39;s surest and the crazy thing about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.660" end="00:48:33.030" style="s2">is if you actually care about other</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.300" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">people and a society where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.030" end="00:48:38.010" style="s2">cared for it&#39;s really helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:40.650" style="s2">acknowledge that there are heritable</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.010" end="00:48:44.100" style="s2">individual differences in intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.650" end="00:48:47.910" style="s2">and conscientiousness meaning willpower</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.100" end="00:48:50.070" style="s2">and lots of traits so not everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.910" end="00:48:52.860" style="s2">gonna be able to become an Elon Musk in</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.070" end="00:48:54.780" style="s2">fact not everybody maybe is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.860" end="00:48:56.760" style="s2">finishing college and learning through</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.780" end="00:49:00.570" style="s2">college textbooks and lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.760" end="00:49:03.420" style="s2">that&#39;s okay but instead the left has</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.570" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">adopted this delusional fantasy that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.420" end="00:49:08.250" style="s2">says if you just shove enough education</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.520" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">down people&#39;s throats everyone can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.250" end="00:49:13.320" style="s2">competitive in a global you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:16.500" style="s2">information and technology based economy</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.320" end="00:49:20.220" style="s2">and that leads to disillusionment</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.500" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">disappointment frustration shame you</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.220" end="00:49:27.480" style="s2">know victim blaming and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:30.810" style="s2">leads to a nation where everybody who is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.480" end="00:49:33.060" style="s2">successful looks down with total</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.810" end="00:49:35.580" style="s2">contempt on everybody who isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.060" end="00:49:37.619" style="s2">successful and you see that with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.580" end="00:49:40.560" style="s2">elite attitudes towards let&#39;s say Trump</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.619" end="00:49:42.150" style="s2">voters right well you know what&#39;s so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.560" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">six foot four so I&#39;ve been blessed</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.150" end="00:49:46.770" style="s2">genetically with height but I played</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:48.780" style="s2">basketball in high school and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.770" end="00:49:50.820" style="s2">blessed genetically enough with height</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.780" end="00:49:52.200" style="s2">or athleticism to become like a college</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.820" end="00:49:54.510" style="s2">basketball player or a professional</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.200" end="00:49:56.700" style="s2">basketball player and I guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.510" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">that professional basketball player does</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.700" end="00:50:00.660" style="s2">not look at me with contempt because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">incapable of playing professional</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.660" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">basketball based on my genetics and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:08.049" style="s2">also not the most dominant guy in every</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:10.359" style="s2">room I mean all the time but not all</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.049" end="00:50:11.799" style="s2">I&#39;m not the smartest guy I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.359" end="00:50:13.569" style="s2">the leader in every situation that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.799" end="00:50:14.109" style="s2">been in and you know what I&#39;m okay with</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.569" end="00:50:16.179" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.109" end="00:50:18.249" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s because I do have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.179" end="00:50:20.380" style="s2">relatively high put you know status in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.249" end="00:50:22.479" style="s2">my you know circles and whatnot but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.380" end="00:50:24.999" style="s2">think that there is a certain assumption</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.479" end="00:50:26.589" style="s2">that people are incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.999" end="00:50:30.249" style="s2">acknowledging their place in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.589" end="00:50:34.239" style="s2">hierarchy and would feel somehow I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.249" end="00:50:36.039" style="s2">know angry hateful something else</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.239" end="00:50:38.170" style="s2">horribly negative if you know when they</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.039" end="00:50:39.579" style="s2">you know understand that their place you</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.170" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">know where where it is and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.579" end="00:50:45.130" style="s2">this blank slate stuff is a way to as</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:47.890" style="s2">you said you know find a perfect ability</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.130" end="00:50:50.769" style="s2">in the human condition and human</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.890" end="00:50:52.869" style="s2">performance but then it leads exactly to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.769" end="00:50:54.789" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying which is well if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.869" end="00:50:55.420" style="s2">didn&#39;t succeed then you just didn&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.789" end="00:50:59.140" style="s2">hard enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.420" end="00:51:01.089" style="s2">yeah exactly I mean to me you know the a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.140" end="00:51:04.119" style="s2">fundamental question for civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.089" end="00:51:07.660" style="s2">that have you know a population with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.119" end="00:51:09.819" style="s2">distribution of traits is not what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.660" end="00:51:12.729" style="s2">upper limit of success if if you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.819" end="00:51:16.749" style="s2">extraordinary abilities rather it&#39;s does</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.729" end="00:51:19.150" style="s2">your society give people with an IQ of a</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.009" end="00:51:33.640" style="s2">and if a society can&#39;t offer that to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.059" end="00:51:35.759" style="s2">literally average people if it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.640" end="00:51:39.069" style="s2">sweeps that issue under the rug that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.759" end="00:51:40.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a failed society mmm-hmm and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.069" end="00:51:45.369" style="s2">think that&#39;s something the left is not</p>

<p begin="00:51:45.369" end="00:51:50.619" style="s2">you can&#39;t solve that problem by just</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.670" end="00:51:53.670" style="s2">expanding the welfare state or teaching</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.619" end="00:51:55.989" style="s2">everybody gender feminism or you know</p>

<p begin="00:51:58.660" end="00:52:01.989" style="s2">there&#39;s other things that come out of</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.920" end="00:55:27.750" style="s2">like redistributing wealth but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:30.990" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of creating a set of social</p>

<p begin="01:03:16.630" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">of right now is if we are evolving</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.530" end="01:03:28.030" style="s2">constantly evolving and I ideally were</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:29.560" style="s2">or theoretically where we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.030" end="01:03:32.109" style="s2">forward in a way that&#39;s sort of like a</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.619" end="01:03:54.339" style="s2">that needs to die is it dis genic as we</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.930" end="01:03:56.349" style="s2">said this just like there&#39;s a kind of</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.750" end="01:04:08.410" style="s2">terrible it&#39;s selecting the wrong genes</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.310" end="01:04:11.170" style="s2">the gene pool is gonna go to hell if</p>

<p begin="01:04:11.170" end="01:04:16.869" style="s2">know within 20 years we&#39;ll have the</p>

<p begin="01:04:16.869" end="01:04:23.950" style="s2">of embryos and possibly in fixing</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.310" end="01:04:27.010" style="s2">mutations and and so within 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.950" end="01:04:30.579" style="s2">within two generations it probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.010" end="01:04:32.380" style="s2">matter that much you know how the mating</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.579" end="01:04:35.680" style="s2">market kind of plays out in terms of</p>

<p begin="01:04:44.910" end="01:04:51.190" style="s2">that will happen I mean within a</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.819" end="01:04:53.920" style="s2">generation or two pretty much everybody</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.190" end="01:04:56.410" style="s2">is gonna be able to afford some kind of</p>

<p begin="01:04:56.410" end="01:05:03.310" style="s2">know of embryos that that is quite</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.440" end="01:05:05.560" style="s2">helpful but I think the short-term</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.310" end="01:05:07.240" style="s2">problem is just people are frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.560" end="01:05:08.800" style="s2">they can&#39;t find mates they can&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.289" end="01:05:27.640" style="s2">maybe even worse like in China the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.329" end="01:05:29.739" style="s2">excess of males over females is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.640" end="01:05:31.569" style="s2">a huge issue and they are gonna have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.739" end="01:05:34.539" style="s2">think very very carefully how do we</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.569" end="01:05:37.869" style="s2">structure mating markets and families so</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.539" end="01:05:39.759" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have a catastrophic level</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.869" end="01:05:42.249" style="s2">of now they&#39;re just gonna ship like ten</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.759" end="01:05:44.279" style="s2">billion guys over the Korean border with</p>

<p begin="01:05:44.279" end="01:05:49.180" style="s2">they might do that they might they might</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.259" end="01:05:52.269" style="s2">recall an AI certain areas of the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.180" end="01:05:54.369" style="s2">who knows but yeah to get back to like</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.269" end="01:05:56.410" style="s2">how did how its why I took us off on</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.369" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">that tangent there but how how can a guy</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.410" end="01:06:04.119" style="s2">today and in his in his partner female</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:08.289" style="s2">partner find the erotic energy that may</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.119" end="01:06:10.210" style="s2">be deleted by this sort of a Galit Aryan</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.289" end="01:06:12.369" style="s2">nature of our professional markets and</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.210" end="01:06:15.519" style="s2">sort of the elimination of hyper hyper</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.369" end="01:06:16.690" style="s2">gammy or hypergamy yeah in and one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.519" end="01:06:20.829" style="s2">the first things I started writing about</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.690" end="01:06:23.049" style="s2">was about BDSM and I found it very</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.829" end="01:06:26.410" style="s2">appealing because you can intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.049" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">create a space that can tap into like</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.410" end="01:06:33.400" style="s2">our primal urges and our instincts and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">wrote a lot about dominance in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.400" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">bedroom sort of sort dominance in your</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.440" end="01:06:38.259" style="s2">day to day life and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:40.569" style="s2">leading into the bedroom and then also</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.259" end="01:06:43.239" style="s2">some explicit stuff about BDSM inside</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.569" end="01:06:46.210" style="s2">the bedroom and I think I&#39;ve found it</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.239" end="01:06:48.690" style="s2">personally to be I&#39;m gonna use this word</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.210" end="01:06:51.849" style="s2">and laugh but like a safe space to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.690" end="01:06:55.089" style="s2">express some of those urges that we have</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.849" end="01:06:58.059" style="s2">that are stifled by you know reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.089" end="01:06:59.559" style="s2">societal norms okay like you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.059" end="01:07:01.119" style="s2">not running around just bashing women</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.559" end="01:07:04.059" style="s2">over the head and raping them whenever</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.119" end="01:07:05.619" style="s2">we want right so but in a controlled</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.059" end="01:07:08.829" style="s2">environment you can create sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.619" end="01:07:12.430" style="s2">a fantasy environment that allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.829" end="01:07:14.950" style="s2">get that real visceral feeling real</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.430" end="01:07:16.690" style="s2">primal energy that if you haven&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.950" end="01:07:20.380" style="s2">haven&#39;t experienced it it&#39;s kind of hard</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.690" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">to describe so what what I know that BDS</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.380" end="01:07:24.789" style="s2">I&#39;m very fringy and it&#39;s very you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:26.469" style="s2">people who look down on it because they</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.789" end="01:07:27.490" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it I think and I find</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.469" end="01:07:31.030" style="s2">it personally to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.490" end="01:07:33.700" style="s2">a very high intellectual you know driven</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.030" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">experience where you need a big you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.700" end="01:07:37.930" style="s2">high level of creativity and honesty and</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:41.290" style="s2">openness and communication and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.930" end="01:07:46.900" style="s2">actually very sophisticated what role do</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.290" end="01:07:48.850" style="s2">you see you know of fantasy space in in</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.900" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">sort of tapping into those feelings that</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.850" end="01:07:54.280" style="s2">can sort of get us through this period</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:55.690" style="s2">where you know yeah the mating markets</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.280" end="01:07:57.780" style="s2">are gonna put people together that may</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.690" end="01:08:01.420" style="s2">not have been put together in the past</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.780" end="01:08:02.680" style="s2">something like that so I&#39;ve given a</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.420" end="01:08:04.750" style="s2">couple talks actually about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.680" end="01:08:07.750" style="s2">evolutionary psychology of BDSM and I do</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.750" end="01:08:09.700" style="s2">talk about kink and BDSM in my human</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.750" end="01:08:10.810" style="s2">sexuality class I think it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.700" end="01:08:12.640" style="s2">fascinating there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.810" end="01:08:16.240" style="s2">misconceptions people have about it they</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.640" end="01:08:20.069" style="s2">think it&#39;s all about whips and chains my</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.240" end="01:08:23.350" style="s2">reading is you know the heart of BDSM is</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.069" end="01:08:26.069" style="s2">basically power exchange roleplay and</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.350" end="01:08:28.230" style="s2">how insane consensual and usually</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.069" end="01:08:30.910" style="s2">consensual power exchange which is like</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.230" end="01:08:32.529" style="s2">it&#39;s just like kids doing roleplay like</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.910" end="01:08:33.970" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna pretend to be the pirate</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.529" end="01:08:36.220" style="s2">captain and you&#39;re gonna pretend to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.970" end="01:08:39.130" style="s2">my captive and let&#39;s just see how that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.220" end="01:08:40.750" style="s2">plays out is that cool with you and if I</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.130" end="01:08:45.819" style="s2">do anything you don&#39;t like just say the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.750" end="01:08:49.810" style="s2">safe word like red and we&#39;ll stop so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.819" end="01:08:54.609" style="s2">power exchange means that a couple can</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.810" end="01:08:56.410" style="s2">sort of rebalance the power that they</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.609" end="01:09:00.040" style="s2">might have an ordinary life maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.410" end="01:09:02.650" style="s2">guy can explore more assertiveness and</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.040" end="01:09:05.859" style="s2">domination and and activity and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.650" end="01:09:07.930" style="s2">be a little Bossier then he might feel</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.859" end="01:09:10.210" style="s2">comfortable doing an ordinary life and</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.930" end="01:09:12.190" style="s2">maybe the woman can be more submissive</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.210" end="01:09:14.500" style="s2">and passive and overwhelmed and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.190" end="01:09:17.620" style="s2">or vice versa you know whatever floats</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.500" end="01:09:19.529" style="s2">your boat and it is a safe space where</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.620" end="01:09:22.240" style="s2">you can explore your revolt psychology</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.529" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">or let&#39;s say the woman can explore her</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.240" end="01:09:28.210" style="s2">hypergamy and she can say okay I know</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:30.460" style="s2">you know you&#39;re only whatever a</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.210" end="01:09:33.970" style="s2">journalist or a professor or a lawyer in</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.460" end="01:09:37.029" style="s2">real life but imagine you were you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.970" end="01:09:40.920" style="s2">a Mongol warlord or a Roman Emperor or</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.029" end="01:09:44.170" style="s2">whatever let&#39;s let&#39;s game that out and</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.920" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">when people do that I&#39;ve talked a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.170" end="01:09:48.730" style="s2">people who are into kink they say you</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:51.220" style="s2">discover so many new parts of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.730" end="01:09:54.550" style="s2">you didn&#39;t know existed or you were kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.220" end="01:09:57.640" style="s2">of vaguely aware of but you can let them</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.550" end="01:10:01.420" style="s2">out you can let them play you can you</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.640" end="01:10:06.340" style="s2">can turn them into an amazing expression</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.420" end="01:10:09.330" style="s2">of creativity in fact and so I wish that</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.340" end="01:10:12.960" style="s2">more couples therapists would kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.330" end="01:10:16.420" style="s2">even prescribe roleplay as a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.960" end="01:10:19.060" style="s2">intervention that might help a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.420" end="01:10:20.410" style="s2">relationships I&#39;ve never met a girl that</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.060" end="01:10:22.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t like having her hair pulled I</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.410" end="01:10:24.450" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.780" end="01:10:29.550" style="s2">universal statement that I can make and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.450" end="01:10:32.380" style="s2">my sample size is not insignificant and</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.550" end="01:10:34.390" style="s2">related just there&#39;s none of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.380" end="01:10:36.040" style="s2">squirrels around my house and just the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.390" end="01:10:37.600" style="s2">other day my five-year-old daughter was</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.040" end="01:10:39.670" style="s2">like Daddy what is that squirrel doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.600" end="01:10:42.550" style="s2">to the other squirrel and I looked out</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.670" end="01:10:45.010" style="s2">there and they were mating but in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.550" end="01:10:47.830" style="s2">process there was like a penetration and</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.010" end="01:10:50.230" style="s2">then the male jumped up on the back of</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.830" end="01:10:51.820" style="s2">the female and just just not on its neck</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.230" end="01:10:53.230" style="s2">and just like in its neck and bit its</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.820" end="01:10:54.700" style="s2">neck and bit its neck and then jump back</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.230" end="01:10:56.260" style="s2">and did some more penetration and jump</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.700" end="01:11:00.520" style="s2">back up on top and just bit its neck and</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.260" end="01:11:04.480" style="s2">pinned it down and that kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.520" end="01:11:06.220" style="s2">prevalent I think all across animal</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.480" end="01:11:08.890" style="s2">species I mean I&#39;m not a complete expert</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.220" end="01:11:10.840" style="s2">yes if I mean 70 million years of mammal</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.890" end="01:11:13.180" style="s2">evolution and four thousand species of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:15.460" style="s2">mammals and the males are typically you</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.180" end="01:11:18.970" style="s2">know copulating so-called doggystyle</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.460" end="01:11:21.810" style="s2">which often involves a bite on the feem</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.970" end="01:11:24.160" style="s2">the back of the female&#39;s neck which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.810" end="01:11:26.710" style="s2">kind of the equivalent of modern human</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.160" end="01:11:28.139" style="s2">hair pulling all right it&#39;s deep deep</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.710" end="01:11:31.469" style="s2">deep and it&#39;s across</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.139" end="01:11:34.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s not some weird little thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.469" end="01:11:38.580" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely standard animal mating</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.650" end="01:11:41.699" style="s2">behavior now what&#39;s interesting to me is</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.580" end="01:11:45.750" style="s2">I find that I find a lot of resistance</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.699" end="01:11:47.489" style="s2">to you know kink or BDSM from people who</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.750" end="01:11:50.730" style="s2">would be considered like traditional</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.489" end="01:11:53.730" style="s2">traditional right trad con kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.730" end="01:11:57.119" style="s2">and then you find you know the radical</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.730" end="01:11:59.670" style="s2">lefties you know really into it or very</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.119" end="01:12:01.260" style="s2">open-minded to it and you know what do</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.670" end="01:12:04.050" style="s2">you what do you attribute that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.260" end="01:12:06.000" style="s2">difference to when on the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.050" end="01:12:07.860" style="s2">side you think that they may be more</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:09.840" style="s2">aligned with our sort of animal</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.860" end="01:12:12.389" style="s2">behaviors and leadership and dominance</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.840" end="01:12:13.920" style="s2">and whatnot but then on the on the lefty</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.389" end="01:12:15.900" style="s2">side where they want us to all be blank</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.920" end="01:12:19.469" style="s2">slates and you know we&#39;re all the same</p>

<p begin="01:12:32.610" end="01:12:37.679" style="s2">politically correct way and if you ask a</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.000" end="01:12:41.270" style="s2">lot of conservatives about BDSM they</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.679" end="01:12:44.610" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s weird and degenerate and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.270" end="01:12:49.920" style="s2">some like they have a sexual disgust</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.610" end="01:12:51.750" style="s2">reaction to it it&#39;s on the one hand you</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.920" end="01:12:53.969" style="s2">you could think well a traditional</p>

<p begin="01:13:16.830" end="01:13:23.670" style="s2">quote I mean when I was growing up you</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.119" end="01:13:25.260" style="s2">know in Ohio I saw a lot of my parents</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.670" end="01:13:28.920" style="s2">friends and how their marriages worked</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.260" end="01:13:31.949" style="s2">and it kind of what&#39;s that and at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.920" end="01:13:33.719" style="s2">time or maybe later in college I thought</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.949" end="01:13:36.060" style="s2">oh my god that&#39;s so patriarchal and</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.719" end="01:13:38.210" style="s2">exploited of in a weird and but then</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.060" end="01:13:40.490" style="s2">later the last few years I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.210" end="01:13:43.220" style="s2">wait maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.490" end="01:13:43.970" style="s2">a lot more consensual in a way than I</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.220" end="01:13:45.950" style="s2">realized</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.970" end="01:13:49.100" style="s2">like maybe the women were actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.950" end="01:13:52.580" style="s2">choosing the guys who embodied that and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.100" end="01:13:55.490" style="s2">they wanted that and okay it&#39;s got pros</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.580" end="01:13:57.680" style="s2">and cons but just like we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.490" end="01:14:00.110" style="s2">judge people who go into a 24/7</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.680" end="01:14:01.160" style="s2">master-slave relationship is like oh my</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.110" end="01:14:03.380" style="s2">god that&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.160" end="01:14:06.530" style="s2">maybe we shouldn&#39;t judge people who go</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.380" end="01:14:09.410" style="s2">into a sort of trad life relationship</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.530" end="01:14:11.000" style="s2">that is functionally equivalent in many</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.410" end="01:14:13.640" style="s2">ways never thought of it like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.000" end="01:14:16.510" style="s2">you know so I&#39;m working on this book</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.640" end="01:14:19.970" style="s2">proposal to do a next book that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.510" end="01:14:21.710" style="s2">partly about kind of what can mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.970" end="01:14:24.260" style="s2">relationships learn from these different</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.710" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">sexual subcultures right so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.260" end="01:14:29.120" style="s2">you have a mainstream vanillin marriage</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:32.480" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t want to do full like</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.120" end="01:14:34.840" style="s2">flogging and bondage but what can you</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.480" end="01:14:37.250" style="s2">learn from BDSM that could help you</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.840" end="01:14:39.890" style="s2">that&#39;s not too edgy but that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.250" end="01:14:42.380" style="s2">or what can like monogamous people learn</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.890" end="01:14:43.850" style="s2">from polyamorous people and I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.380" end="01:14:47.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.850" end="01:14:49.600" style="s2">love hacks and relationship tools that</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.090" end="01:14:51.590" style="s2">can be learned from these subcultures</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.600" end="01:14:54.470" style="s2">including for kind of tribe life</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.590" end="01:14:56.390" style="s2">conservatives and conversely I think you</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.470" end="01:15:00.380" style="s2">know standard liberal professional</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.390" end="01:15:02.660" style="s2">couples can learn a lot from like</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.380" end="01:15:04.940" style="s2">Christian relationship advice and books</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.660" end="01:15:07.940" style="s2">or from trad life books or red pill</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.940" end="01:15:09.920" style="s2">books sounds like a fascinating book</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.940" end="01:15:11.330" style="s2">that maybe everybody will read or nobody</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.920" end="01:15:13.340" style="s2">will read yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.330" end="01:15:15.440" style="s2">but the danger is everybody is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.340" end="01:15:18.280" style="s2">read it and go oh my god he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.440" end="01:15:23.450" style="s2">be like non-partisan about sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.280" end="01:15:26.330" style="s2">yeah well so we&#39;re on the topic of</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.450" end="01:15:28.160" style="s2">relationships and sort of family</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.330" end="01:15:32.510" style="s2">formation if that&#39;s not a stretch from</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.160" end="01:15:34.460" style="s2">where we just were nasty a few questions</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.510" end="01:15:37.700" style="s2">and lead into sort of another topic here</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.460" end="01:15:40.370" style="s2">but how where what role is the nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.700" end="01:15:46.010" style="s2">family playing in the makeup of our</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.370" end="01:15:51.350" style="s2">society today and how important is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.010" end="01:15:54.170" style="s2">mitad monogamous relationship to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.350" end="01:15:55.880" style="s2">our economic development our cultural</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.170" end="01:15:59.690" style="s2">development the sustainability of our</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.880" end="01:16:03.860" style="s2">society in general uh that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.690" end="01:16:07.220" style="s2">question so I think on the one hand you</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.860" end="01:16:10.670" style="s2">need a kind of mating and family system</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.220" end="01:16:13.850" style="s2">that gives everybody a vested interests</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.670" end="01:16:15.940" style="s2">or a reasonable shot at happiness that</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.850" end="01:16:20.960" style="s2">having some kind of sexual relationship</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.940" end="01:16:23.720" style="s2">and having kids somehow now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.960" end="01:16:28.070" style="s2">lot to recommend traditional monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.720" end="01:16:31.220" style="s2">marriage as a way to kind of give people</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.070" end="01:16:34.610" style="s2">civilizational buy-in where they go yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.220" end="01:16:36.890" style="s2">I really want to put down roots to have</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.610" end="01:16:38.420" style="s2">a long term relationship to raise kids</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.890" end="01:16:41.750" style="s2">cooperatively in a way that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.420" end="01:16:43.490" style="s2">a burden on other people etc so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.750" end="01:16:47.570" style="s2">pretty good at solving a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.490" end="01:16:49.640" style="s2">and that is why every major civilization</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.570" end="01:16:51.350" style="s2">around the world that&#39;s lasted more than</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.640" end="01:16:56.180" style="s2">a few hundred years and that as a big</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.350" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">population has normative marriage as the</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.180" end="01:17:00.830" style="s2">main way that most people have</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.000" end="01:17:04.430" style="s2">relationships and kids and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.830" end="01:17:06.620" style="s2">elites are always more polygamists or</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.430" end="01:17:09.950" style="s2">polyamorous and there&#39;s some people who</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.620" end="01:17:12.940" style="s2">are left out but by and large if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.950" end="01:17:15.740" style="s2">have one man young woman one woman then</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.940" end="01:17:17.720" style="s2">you know the young men think well I</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.740" end="01:17:19.550" style="s2">might have to fight for the tribe I</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.720" end="01:17:23.090" style="s2">might have to work hard for a while but</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.550" end="01:17:26.150" style="s2">I have a shot at like having at least</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.090" end="01:17:28.970" style="s2">one woman and this is done through norms</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.150" end="01:17:32.030" style="s2">norms mostly right so so this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.970" end="01:17:34.010" style="s2">Peterson we&#39;re talking about and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.030" end="01:17:35.990" style="s2">not his idea right I think the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.010" end="01:17:38.180" style="s2">people were giving him over saying</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.990" end="01:17:39.470" style="s2">enforced monogamy like that he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.180" end="01:17:41.390" style="s2">come up with that but this knows that</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.470" end="01:17:43.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a standard term and it doesn&#39;t of</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.390" end="01:17:45.200" style="s2">course it doesn&#39;t mean physically forced</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.160" end="01:17:47.990" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t even need mean legally</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.200" end="01:17:49.430" style="s2">enforced it can just mean honey don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.990" end="01:17:52.970" style="s2">you want to find a young man to settle</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.430" end="01:17:56.030" style="s2">down without parental enforced</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.970" end="01:17:57.710" style="s2">and until you that you think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.030" end="01:17:59.600" style="s2">directly leads to like increased</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.710" end="01:18:01.460" style="s2">stability economic output</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:04.130" style="s2">you know advancement of society etc</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.460" end="01:18:06.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of evidence from you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.130" end="01:18:07.780" style="s2">evolutionary anthropologists like Johan</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.230" end="01:18:10.940" style="s2">record Harvard and lots of other people</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.780" end="01:18:12.830" style="s2">that you know all else being equal</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.940" end="01:18:16.520" style="s2">monogamous marriage is a pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.830" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">system for reducing homicide rates and</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.520" end="01:18:22.760" style="s2">violence and rape and warfare rates and</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.080" end="01:18:25.910" style="s2">getting guys to be economically</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.760" end="01:18:28.489" style="s2">productive instead of bitter slackers</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.910" end="01:18:32.030" style="s2">right give them a reason I mean men men</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.489" end="01:18:35.000" style="s2">are a beasts of burden but they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.030" end="01:18:37.070" style="s2">they won&#39;t serve if there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.000" end="01:18:39.680" style="s2">reason to right and kids and a wife are</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.070" end="01:18:42.320" style="s2">good good yeah it&#39;s a good motivator get</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.680" end="01:18:45.380" style="s2">your ass up off the couch yeah so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.320" end="01:18:47.780" style="s2">particularly monogamy plus capitalism is</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.380" end="01:18:50.210" style="s2">a hugely powerful way to promote</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.780" end="01:18:53.650" style="s2">economic growth because it means you</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.210" end="01:18:56.060" style="s2">know both sexes have an interest in</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.650" end="01:18:58.190" style="s2">maximizing the welfare of their family</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.060" end="01:18:59.840" style="s2">and their prosperity no I think that</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.190" end="01:19:01.910" style="s2">there would be there&#39;ll be some people</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.840" end="01:19:03.370" style="s2">right now that would argue that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.910" end="01:19:06.770" style="s2">drifting away from this monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.370" end="01:19:10.370" style="s2">committed committed model and not</p>

<p begin="01:19:19.880" end="01:19:24.620" style="s2">this goes to the sort of the Chad and</p>

<p begin="01:19:26.570" end="01:19:33.350" style="s2">came from and I think what what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.590" end="01:19:35.390" style="s2">seen well through my personal experience</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.350" end="01:19:37.190" style="s2">and through just talking to basically</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.390" end="01:19:42.110" style="s2">thousands of guys over the last number</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.190" end="01:19:45.050" style="s2">of years is that there&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.110" end="01:19:47.300" style="s2">distribution of sex partners is going is</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.050" end="01:19:51.260" style="s2">concentrated in the hands of a smaller</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.300" end="01:19:53.840" style="s2">smaller group of men leaving a larger</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.260" end="01:19:56.090" style="s2">group of men without this incentive to</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.840" end="01:19:59.060" style="s2">be economically productive and this</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.090" end="01:20:02.570" style="s2">isn&#39;t happening because for any specific</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.060" end="01:20:03.480" style="s2">or maybe it is policy reasons or whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.570" end="01:20:06.650" style="s2">it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.480" end="01:20:09.980" style="s2">an evolution that&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.650" end="01:20:13.350" style="s2">do you agree that that is the case and</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.980" end="01:20:18.420" style="s2">do you have any can you attribute</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.350" end="01:20:20.940" style="s2">anything to the cause of that I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.420" end="01:20:23.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge problem that you have let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.940" end="01:20:26.190" style="s2">say OkCupid dating apps they have really</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.310" end="01:20:27.930" style="s2">good data where like the the upper 5 or</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.190" end="01:20:29.400" style="s2">10% of the most attractive guys are</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.930" end="01:20:32.430" style="s2">getting the vast majority female</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.400" end="01:20:35.160" style="s2">interest and the lower 60% are basically</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.430" end="01:20:37.380" style="s2">not competitive at all like they get no</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.160" end="01:20:39.300" style="s2">interest from women browsers with women</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.380" end="01:20:42.450" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty evenly distributed like guys</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.300" end="01:20:44.370" style="s2">are a little more attracted to smart and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.450" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">interesting creative and beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.370" end="01:20:51.300" style="s2">younger women but most of the women have</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:52.940" style="s2">a shot on the dating market at least of</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.300" end="01:20:56.730" style="s2">getting a short-term boyfriend</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.940" end="01:20:59.910" style="s2">so that&#39;s exaggerating the differences</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.730" end="01:21:03.150" style="s2">between males the dating apps the fact</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.910" end="01:21:07.620" style="s2">that you know if you&#39;re a really hot</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.150" end="01:21:09.450" style="s2">rich young guy in Manhattan you can have</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.620" end="01:21:12.660" style="s2">literally as many dates as you can</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.450" end="01:21:14.520" style="s2">handle women professional women in</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.660" end="01:21:16.739" style="s2">Manhattan have a much more serious</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.520" end="01:21:19.350" style="s2">competitive situation where yes they can</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.739" end="01:21:22.440" style="s2">find short term boyfriend but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.350" end="01:21:26.010" style="s2">hard to get a guy quality guy to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.440" end="01:21:28.470" style="s2">commit long term so I think the real</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.010" end="01:21:30.950" style="s2">existential threat to the monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.470" end="01:21:33.300" style="s2">marriage system is not it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.950" end="01:21:35.400" style="s2">polyamorous people advocating open</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.300" end="01:21:38.790" style="s2">relationships that are long-term bonds</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.400" end="01:21:42.090" style="s2">rather the real threat is this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.790" end="01:21:44.190" style="s2">extended casual sex life where people</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.090" end="01:21:47.730" style="s2">are just doing kind of casual dating and</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.190" end="01:21:51.030" style="s2">sequential kind of not too serious</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.730" end="01:21:53.070" style="s2">relationships until their mid-30s right</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.030" end="01:21:56.190" style="s2">and then they&#39;re kind of panicking like</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.070" end="01:21:58.260" style="s2">oh my god clock&#39;s ticking right but</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.190" end="01:22:02.720" style="s2">where did that come from I think that</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.260" end="01:22:05.970" style="s2">came partly from the absurd extension of</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.720" end="01:22:08.670" style="s2">educational credential ISM from like</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.970" end="01:22:10.680" style="s2">only a tiny proportion of people saying</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.670" end="01:22:13.940" style="s2">in school through the college degree to</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.680" end="01:22:17.619" style="s2">everybody think I need a master&#39;s degree</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.940" end="01:22:20.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the geographical mobility where</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.619" end="01:22:22.310" style="s2">nobody&#39;s putting down roots until they</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.600" end="01:22:25.340" style="s2">find a partner but they can&#39;t find a</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.310" end="01:22:29.750" style="s2">partner to it put down roots and I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.340" end="01:22:33.650" style="s2">it&#39;s also a common misunderstanding of</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.750" end="01:22:37.280" style="s2">how you know the fertility curve looks</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.650" end="01:22:39.650" style="s2">for women and men for men for that for</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.280" end="01:22:41.659" style="s2">that matter right so I got into a very</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.650" end="01:22:43.929" style="s2">interesting discussion with a guy on</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.659" end="01:22:47.780" style="s2">Twitter a very conservative very</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.929" end="01:22:51.949" style="s2">religious guy and we were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.780" end="01:22:55.570" style="s2">this this very issue and he attributed a</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.949" end="01:22:59.090" style="s2">decline in the marriage rate to</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.570" end="01:23:00.949" style="s2">basically everything costing more right</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.090" end="01:23:04.940" style="s2">and that we you know you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.949" end="01:23:06.710" style="s2">more education you have to work harder</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.940" end="01:23:08.600" style="s2">it takes more time to build your career</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.710" end="01:23:10.280" style="s2">people are satisfied with their career</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.600" end="01:23:13.250" style="s2">so they don&#39;t get married financial</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.280" end="01:23:15.530" style="s2">security and I kept challenging him to</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.250" end="01:23:17.600" style="s2">dig another layer deeper and he could</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.530" end="01:23:18.949" style="s2">his brain just wouldn&#39;t get it and I</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.600" end="01:23:20.600" style="s2">finally just tweeted it and I was like</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.949" end="01:23:24.260" style="s2">the Federal Reserve was causing this</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.600" end="01:23:26.090" style="s2">right like like basically inflation and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.260" end="01:23:28.250" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a very short-handed way of</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.090" end="01:23:30.830" style="s2">saying it but like we&#39;ve increased our</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.250" end="01:23:32.690" style="s2">aggregate demand in our consumer markets</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.830" end="01:23:35.210" style="s2">and housing markets education markets</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.690" end="01:23:39.020" style="s2">and we increased our get demand by what</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.210" end="01:23:42.440" style="s2">by putting women into the into the labor</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.020" end="01:23:45.170" style="s2">force and so in some ways you can really</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.440" end="01:23:47.239" style="s2">trace this desk dissatisfaction the</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.170" end="01:23:49.969" style="s2">delayed marriage the decrease in</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.239" end="01:23:52.699" style="s2">fertility rates you can trace it all the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.969" end="01:23:54.980" style="s2">way back through education and all the</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.699" end="01:23:57.020" style="s2">way back to you know people you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.980" end="01:23:58.369" style="s2">deciding to stop working in the home and</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.020" end="01:24:00.920" style="s2">the abandonment of the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.369" end="01:24:04.369" style="s2">family structure and so I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.920" end="01:24:05.690" style="s2">we&#39;re you know look is this what Trump</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.369" end="01:24:07.130" style="s2">meant by make America great again I</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.690" end="01:24:08.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know right but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.130" end="01:24:10.760" style="s2">people that look back to that time</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.630" end="01:24:12.500" style="s2">period or look back and can just maybe</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.760" end="01:24:14.090" style="s2">not even look back with it fondly but</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.500" end="01:24:16.909" style="s2">even just look back and the kids can</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.090" end="01:24:18.679" style="s2">give some attribution to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.909" end="01:24:21.679" style="s2">the feminist movement that put women</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.679" end="01:24:23.690" style="s2">into the workplace directly leading to</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.679" end="01:24:26.420" style="s2">these circumstances environment that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.690" end="01:24:27.949" style="s2">have now and look nobody I roll with and</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.420" end="01:24:29.690" style="s2">myself is gonna say that like women</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.949" end="01:24:30.650" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have any you know women should</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.690" end="01:24:31.850" style="s2">have all the opportunity in the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.650" end="01:24:36.590" style="s2">that they won&#39;t make any decisions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.850" end="01:24:39.170" style="s2">fine but there&#39;s consequences right and</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.590" end="01:24:41.570" style="s2">so I think we&#39;re sort of seeing those</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.170" end="01:24:44.840" style="s2">consequences today manifests himself in</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.570" end="01:24:46.340" style="s2">these disrupted relationship markets and</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.840" end="01:24:48.290" style="s2">dissatisfaction and then you get the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.340" end="01:24:51.139" style="s2">radical elements of this late wave</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.290" end="01:24:54.770" style="s2">feminism just exacerbating all of it and</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.139" end="01:24:58.880" style="s2">I guess what I&#39;m wondering is like are</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.770" end="01:25:02.750" style="s2">we going to find a way to it a is there</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.880" end="01:25:05.830" style="s2">a rational reason to move back towards</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.750" end="01:25:08.900" style="s2">an emphasis on earlier family formation</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.830" end="01:25:12.020" style="s2">stricter enforcement of marriage laws</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.900" end="01:25:14.389" style="s2">etcetera you know is there a real</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.020" end="01:25:16.639" style="s2">positive outcome that we could say this</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.389" end="01:25:19.460" style="s2">is we this is why we need to do this and</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.639" end="01:25:21.440" style="s2">and what would we do and is anybody</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.460" end="01:25:24.050" style="s2">actually gonna you know make any changes</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.440" end="01:25:26.480" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a lot of factors that go</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.050" end="01:25:29.150" style="s2">into people having this this deep kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.480" end="01:25:31.040" style="s2">of economic pessimism and fear like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.150" end="01:25:31.750" style="s2">not ready to start a family yet I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.040" end="01:25:34.429" style="s2">afford it</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.750" end="01:25:36.889" style="s2">part of its housing policy right are</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.429" end="01:25:39.560" style="s2">twin a friend on Twitter Noah Smith</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.889" end="01:25:42.320" style="s2">tweets a lot about how absurdly</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.560" end="01:25:45.139" style="s2">expensive it is in most major happening</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.320" end="01:25:47.630" style="s2">cities to buy a house right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.139" end="01:25:50.030" style="s2">not just because everybody wants to live</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.630" end="01:25:52.610" style="s2">there it&#39;s because there are actual</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.030" end="01:25:54.590" style="s2">government policies that are idiotic and</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.610" end="01:25:58.100" style="s2">harmful right there&#39;s no policies in our</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.590" end="01:26:00.710" style="s2">subsidies it&#39;s all that and still turn</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.100" end="01:26:03.080" style="s2">down into our relationships yeah lose my</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.710" end="01:26:04.489" style="s2">mind and nobody you know the politicians</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.080" end="01:26:06.440" style="s2">and the economists don&#39;t typically think</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.489" end="01:26:09.170" style="s2">about okay what exactly are the side</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.440" end="01:26:12.170" style="s2">effects of minimizing new housing</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.170" end="01:26:16.190" style="s2">construction in the Bay Area but it does</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.170" end="01:26:18.440" style="s2">have effects of course I think secondly</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.190" end="01:26:21.860" style="s2">you know as you point out the two income</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.440" end="01:26:24.110" style="s2">couples absolutely everybody should have</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.860" end="01:26:26.960" style="s2">the freedom to find a job but there are</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.110" end="01:26:30.240" style="s2">side effects which is that the same</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.960" end="01:26:31.590" style="s2">house that you know a man and</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.240" end="01:26:34.460" style="s2">housewife would have been able to afford</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.590" end="01:26:37.680" style="s2">fifty years ago now costs twice as much</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.460" end="01:26:41.370" style="s2">because most couples are to two income</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.680" end="01:26:42.960" style="s2">couples of course that and but people</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.370" end="01:26:44.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about that in the seventies</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.960" end="01:26:46.710" style="s2">when there was this wave of women</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.280" end="01:26:49.920" style="s2">entering the workforce that it will soon</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.710" end="01:26:52.170" style="s2">become obligatory for most women right</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.920" end="01:26:54.510" style="s2">they thought of it as a I want to say a</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.170" end="01:26:55.440" style="s2">luxury but it was this is my choice this</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.510" end="01:26:56.610" style="s2">is gonna be great it&#39;s gonna be great</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.440" end="01:26:59.190" style="s2">for me it&#39;s gonna be great for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.610" end="01:27:02.010" style="s2">yeah and then I think a third factor is</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.190" end="01:27:04.100" style="s2">over parenting this sort of leftist idea</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.010" end="01:27:06.450" style="s2">that oh if it&#39;s a blank slate</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.100" end="01:27:09.180" style="s2">parenting&#39;s really hard because you have</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.450" end="01:27:12.150" style="s2">the entire burden of shaping these</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.180" end="01:27:14.490" style="s2">little people yourself as parents right</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.150" end="01:27:16.170" style="s2">all the evolutionary psychologists and</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.490" end="01:27:19.140" style="s2">behavior geneticists I know are very</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.170" end="01:27:21.090" style="s2">relaxed parents because they&#39;re like we</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.140" end="01:27:23.340" style="s2">have a baby it was born of many many</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.090" end="01:27:26.580" style="s2">instincts shaped on millions of years</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.340" end="01:27:27.690" style="s2">it&#39;s got genes I&#39;m good you&#39;re good our</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.580" end="01:27:29.700" style="s2">kids gonna be fine</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.690" end="01:27:31.230" style="s2">to just roll with it just feed them and</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.700" end="01:27:34.320" style="s2">they grow yeah and they&#39;ll be fine yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.230" end="01:27:36.810" style="s2">by contrast the planks laters are the</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.320" end="01:27:38.910" style="s2">ones who do this this coddling and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.810" end="01:27:41.280" style="s2">over parent the helicopter parenting the</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.910" end="01:27:43.860" style="s2">tiger mothering all that stuff and they</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.280" end="01:27:45.780" style="s2">over invest in their kids and drive</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.860" end="01:27:48.870" style="s2">their kids nuts with all the</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.780" end="01:27:51.360" style="s2">extracurriculars and it&#39;s catastrophic</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.870" end="01:27:53.430" style="s2">because it means people delay having</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.360" end="01:27:56.970" style="s2">kids until they think they can do all</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.430" end="01:27:59.640" style="s2">that well I had of a theory that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.970" end="01:28:01.440" style="s2">reason that the helicopter parenting I</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.640" end="01:28:02.910" style="s2">think they now call bulldozer parenting</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.440" end="01:28:04.340" style="s2">to like you have to clear every obstacle</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.910" end="01:28:06.630" style="s2">out of the way for your child</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.340" end="01:28:10.350" style="s2">why that&#39;s become more prevalent is</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.630" end="01:28:12.360" style="s2">because the value of the egg is more</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.350" end="01:28:14.910" style="s2">Vella it has higher value at the time of</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.360" end="01:28:16.650" style="s2">conception and because there&#39;s a finite</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.910" end="01:28:18.330" style="s2">supply of them it becomes even more</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.650" end="01:28:20.370" style="s2">valuable so you&#39;re just there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.330" end="01:28:22.530" style="s2">more anxiety around a successful outcome</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.370" end="01:28:24.870" style="s2">whereas if you&#39;re banging him out from</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.530" end="01:28:26.490" style="s2">18 to 24 and you&#39;ve got eight and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.870" end="01:28:28.170" style="s2">know sadly you have a miscarriage and</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.490" end="01:28:30.150" style="s2">you know one of them is a screw-up and</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.170" end="01:28:34.020" style="s2">you know just kind of there&#39;s there was</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.150" end="01:28:36.599" style="s2">less of a mathematical emphasis on on</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.020" end="01:28:39.599" style="s2">the eggs and now here we are you</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.599" end="01:28:41.309" style="s2">this is my last chance and I have to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.599" end="01:28:43.079" style="s2">absolutely everything I possibly can to</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.309" end="01:28:45.269" style="s2">make sure that this child has every</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.079" end="01:28:47.639" style="s2">opportunity then it&#39;s just I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.269" end="01:28:49.260" style="s2">really created a mutated market for</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.639" end="01:28:51.989" style="s2">parenting and I see it you know with my</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.260" end="01:28:54.329" style="s2">kids and I&#39;m I&#39;m one of those relaxed</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.989" end="01:28:57.989" style="s2">parents but at the same time I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.329" end="01:29:01.530" style="s2">like so I here&#39;s a little story my I had</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.989" end="01:29:02.699" style="s2">a friend over with his kids and my 13</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.530" end="01:29:04.349" style="s2">year old daughter wanted to climb the</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.699" end="01:29:05.729" style="s2">tree in the backyard and she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.349" end="01:29:06.749" style="s2">daddy you know will he help me up and I</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.729" end="01:29:09.119" style="s2">was like I&#39;ll help you up but I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.749" end="01:29:10.559" style="s2">help you down she&#39;s like okay so she you</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.119" end="01:29:12.629" style="s2">know made the calculation and she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.559" end="01:29:13.679" style="s2">okay I helped her up and she was up</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.629" end="01:29:15.300" style="s2">there for a while and then when it was</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.679" end="01:29:17.070" style="s2">time for her to come down she got you</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.300" end="01:29:21.599" style="s2">know real scared but she figured it out</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.070" end="01:29:23.399" style="s2">by contrast my friends kids he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.599" end="01:29:27.090" style="s2">don&#39;t climb the tree you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.399" end="01:29:30.449" style="s2">hurt you know and you know are we going</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.090" end="01:29:32.699" style="s2">to teach your kid to try and fail or be</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.449" end="01:29:34.169" style="s2">resilient or anti fragile whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.699" end="01:29:37.739" style="s2">word is today if you&#39;re not giving them</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.169" end="01:29:39.269" style="s2">out opportunity and you know to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.739" end="01:29:40.739" style="s2">all tied together when you when you</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.269" end="01:29:43.679" style="s2">break it down and say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.739" end="01:29:47.129" style="s2">economics and it&#39;s policy it&#39;s feminist</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.679" end="01:29:48.629" style="s2">policy it&#39;s labor force issues it you</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.129" end="01:29:50.489" style="s2">know to me I&#39;m trying to look at the big</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.629" end="01:29:52.199" style="s2">picture and try to see how one we can</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.489" end="01:29:54.269" style="s2">have these discussions about policy and</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.199" end="01:29:55.919" style="s2">ideology and philosophy and see you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.269" end="01:29:58.260" style="s2">what the hell comes our gonna be but you</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.919" end="01:30:00.239" style="s2">know then I&#39;m trying to turn it into a</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.260" end="01:30:02.969" style="s2">practical application for for people</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.239" end="01:30:05.820" style="s2">that I know and it&#39;s a I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.969" end="01:30:07.709" style="s2">running upstream you know with this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.820" end="01:30:09.059" style="s2">gonna know another metaphor like a fish</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.709" end="01:30:10.889" style="s2">a fish out of water it&#39;s like a whole</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.059" end="01:30:13.289" style="s2">weird environment that it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.889" end="01:30:15.780" style="s2">to add up to me and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.289" end="01:30:17.189" style="s2">think that that&#39;s getting any better of</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.780" end="01:30:20.249" style="s2">course you can see this in exaggerated</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.189" end="01:30:22.109" style="s2">form in Chinese parenting in the 90s and</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.249" end="01:30:24.059" style="s2">the odds after they had the one-child</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.109" end="01:30:27.239" style="s2">policy and if you&#39;re only allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.059" end="01:30:30.239" style="s2">have one kid they invest like crazy in</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.239" end="01:30:34.409" style="s2">it by contrast like my maternal</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.239" end="01:30:36.179" style="s2">grandmother had 12 kids and I think you</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.409" end="01:30:38.309" style="s2">know she and her husband took kind of as</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.179" end="01:30:40.949" style="s2">more statistical approach like they knew</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.309" end="01:30:42.989" style="s2">some of these kids will get into Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.949" end="01:30:44.550" style="s2">MIT as they did and some of them will go</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.989" end="01:30:46.889" style="s2">to a University of Cincinnati as they</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.550" end="01:30:49.480" style="s2">did and some might not go to college and</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.889" end="01:30:51.690" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay so</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.480" end="01:30:54.910" style="s2">you can let the kids be who they are</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.690" end="01:30:57.640" style="s2">instead of thinking well if I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.910" end="01:31:00.700" style="s2">them into an elite school and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.640" end="01:31:02.980" style="s2">have a thriving professional career then</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.700" end="01:31:05.140" style="s2">then I&#39;m failure like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.980" end="01:31:06.640" style="s2">terrible so the next thing that I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.140" end="01:31:10.210" style="s2">to talk about was I was listening to</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.640" end="01:31:12.690" style="s2">your podcast with Sam Harris and in it</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.210" end="01:31:16.470" style="s2">you said that you had observed a</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.690" end="01:31:20.290" style="s2">Cambrian explosion of mating options</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.470" end="01:31:22.810" style="s2">what what did you mean by that and what</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.290" end="01:31:24.280" style="s2">is the significance for us moving</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.810" end="01:31:25.860" style="s2">forward and again try to explain a</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.280" end="01:31:28.270" style="s2">couple of the things that you observed</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.860" end="01:31:30.100" style="s2">so the Cambrian explosion is this</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.270" end="01:31:31.870" style="s2">amazing thing that happened in an</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.100" end="01:31:34.560" style="s2">evolution about five hundred thirty</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.870" end="01:31:37.270" style="s2">million years ago where animals evolved</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.560" end="01:31:40.030" style="s2">multicellular bodies and nervous systems</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.270" end="01:31:42.400" style="s2">for the first time ever since life began</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.030" end="01:31:44.560" style="s2">on earth four billion years ago and you</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.400" end="01:31:47.920" style="s2">got this amazing diversification of</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.560" end="01:31:50.290" style="s2">different body forms behaviors</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.920" end="01:31:53.470" style="s2">biodiversity and and that Cambrian</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.290" end="01:31:56.940" style="s2">explosion really led to you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.470" end="01:32:01.000" style="s2">whole spectrum of modern animal life</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.940" end="01:32:05.130" style="s2">from octopuses to mammals to birds etc</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.000" end="01:32:07.480" style="s2">and I think analogously at the moment in</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.130" end="01:32:08.920" style="s2">culture worldwide but especially in</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.480" end="01:32:11.130" style="s2">American culture we&#39;re seeing a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.920" end="01:32:14.739" style="s2">Cambrian explosion of different</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.130" end="01:32:16.390" style="s2">relationship styles mating norms</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.739" end="01:32:18.880" style="s2">different ways of people can interact</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.390" end="01:32:21.640" style="s2">sexually short term long term whatever</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.880" end="01:32:25.230" style="s2">and that spectrum includes everything</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.640" end="01:32:27.910" style="s2">from trad life monogamous marriage to</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.230" end="01:32:29.650" style="s2">so-called a relationship anarchy which</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.910" end="01:32:31.960" style="s2">is a form of polyamory where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.650" end="01:32:34.030" style="s2">really try to define your relationship</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.960" end="01:32:36.550" style="s2">from a commitments to things like</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.030" end="01:32:40.710" style="s2">monogamish relationships that are a</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.550" end="01:32:40.710" style="s2">little bit open but not totally open to</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.830" end="01:32:48.070" style="s2">you know polygynous cults to just</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.520" end="01:32:52.480" style="s2">standard casual dating which is its own</p>

<p begin="01:32:52.480" end="01:32:56.250" style="s2">be fascinating to see how this all</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.950" end="01:32:58.810" style="s2">shakes out and which of those</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.250" end="01:33:01.360" style="s2">relationship styles actually prove to be</p>

<p begin="01:33:14.320" end="01:33:19.090" style="s2">has to kind of brace for the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.150" end="01:33:22.720" style="s2">this is happening people are exploring</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.090" end="01:33:26.770" style="s2">new options beyond monogamous marriage</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.720" end="01:33:28.870" style="s2">and beyond just casual dating and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.770" end="01:33:30.670" style="s2">big trend I mean more people are doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.870" end="01:33:34.360" style="s2">these alternative relationships that our</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.670" end="01:33:36.430" style="s2">gay and lesbian for example what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.360" end="01:33:38.680" style="s2">percentage would you put on that well</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.430" end="01:33:40.950" style="s2">people are often surprised to learn only</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.680" end="01:33:44.080" style="s2">about 2% of people are gay or lesbian</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.950" end="01:33:46.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of bisexual</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.080" end="01:33:48.850" style="s2">women but homosexuality is a lot less</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.720" end="01:33:50.860" style="s2">common than most folks think those folks</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.850" end="01:33:54.120" style="s2">think it&#39;s about 10 percent it isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:34:01.960" end="01:34:08.080" style="s2">somewhere between maybe 10 percent 25</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.950" end="01:34:10.510" style="s2">percent you know because it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.080" end="01:34:13.030" style="s2">find good data on this but it&#39;s a least</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.510" end="01:34:15.550" style="s2">that level know I wrote a book a while</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.030" end="01:34:17.620" style="s2">back called sex at dawn you familiar</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.550" end="01:34:20.760" style="s2">with this oh yeah yeah so I think the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.620" end="01:34:25.270" style="s2">basic premise was that pre-agricultural</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.760" end="01:34:28.360" style="s2">homo sapiens were you know the mixed and</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.270" end="01:34:30.760" style="s2">matched mates and they shared fruits and</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.360" end="01:34:34.090" style="s2">berries and woolly mammoths and they</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.760" end="01:34:37.210" style="s2">also shared their partners and that led</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.090" end="01:34:39.970" style="s2">us you know from you know carried us</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.210" end="01:34:43.510" style="s2">evolutionarily up until the agricultural</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.970" end="01:34:46.710" style="s2">era do you think that the remnants of</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.510" end="01:34:49.570" style="s2">that is still inside of us right now I</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.710" end="01:34:51.910" style="s2">think there&#39;s a grain of truth in that</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.570" end="01:34:54.130" style="s2">but my model of prehistory is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.910" end="01:34:57.220" style="s2">halfway between the sexes Adhan model</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.130" end="01:34:58.930" style="s2">which is quite polyamorous right and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.220" end="01:35:01.390" style="s2">kind of traditional pair-bond</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.930" end="01:35:03.280" style="s2">model that says well yeah our ancestors</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.390" end="01:35:04.900" style="s2">kind of fooled around a bit when there</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.280" end="01:35:07.780" style="s2">are teenagers and young adults but then</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.900" end="01:35:10.300" style="s2">they tend to deform mostly a monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.780" end="01:35:13.690" style="s2">pair bonds the lasted at least a few</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.300" end="01:35:14.540" style="s2">years often a lifetime and that most</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.690" end="01:35:18.290" style="s2">kids were born</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.540" end="01:35:19.880" style="s2">into pair-bonded couples I think it is</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.290" end="01:35:22.610" style="s2">true most kids were born into pair of</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.880" end="01:35:26.690" style="s2">wanted couples the question is how</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.610" end="01:35:30.650" style="s2">exclusive were the pair bonds my hunch</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.690" end="01:35:33.470" style="s2">is that we&#39;re pretty flexible about that</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.650" end="01:35:36.170" style="s2">that if the economic and social and</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.470" end="01:35:40.490" style="s2">religious conditions favor strict</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.170" end="01:35:43.400" style="s2">monogamy most people can do that most of</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.490" end="01:35:51.110" style="s2">the time on the other hand if the social</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.400" end="01:35:53.900" style="s2">economic religious conditions allow more</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.110" end="01:35:55.880" style="s2">openness a lot of people quite like to</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.900" end="01:35:57.050" style="s2">try that thank you very much yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.880" end="01:35:59.570" style="s2">and particularly if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.050" end="01:36:03.440" style="s2">contraception and good you know safer</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.570" end="01:36:06.320" style="s2">sex barrier is STI testing yeah well you</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.440" end="01:36:08.870" style="s2">know personally I&#39;ve been in a long-term</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.320" end="01:36:10.130" style="s2">relationship but you know I almost said</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.870" end="01:36:11.540" style="s2">the word committed but you know it is</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.130" end="01:36:15.250" style="s2">committed we are committed to each other</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.540" end="01:36:17.510" style="s2">but it&#39;s also it&#39;s also open and we</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.250" end="01:36:20.660" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t use the word poly</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.510" end="01:36:23.170" style="s2">amorous we will use the word ethically</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.660" end="01:36:25.040" style="s2">non-monogamous and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.170" end="01:36:27.860" style="s2">precondition for at all it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.040" end="01:36:30.860" style="s2">complete open honesty a ton of</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.860" end="01:36:32.720" style="s2">communication and a respect for how the</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.860" end="01:36:34.940" style="s2">other person is feeling about things and</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.720" end="01:36:39.920" style="s2">what we have found and what I found</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.940" end="01:36:42.650" style="s2">personally most so is that every time I</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.920" end="01:36:45.310" style="s2">have a sort of mini relationship with a</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.650" end="01:36:47.660" style="s2">third party or even just a single date</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.310" end="01:36:51.280" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve returned to my primary</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.660" end="01:36:54.650" style="s2">relationship rejuvenated and excited and</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.280" end="01:36:56.180" style="s2">sexually aroused even and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.650" end="01:36:59.840" style="s2">there&#39;s some you know evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.180" end="01:37:02.960" style="s2">rationale for that I&#39;ve heard of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.840" end="01:37:04.820" style="s2">sperm competition and just a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.960" end="01:37:06.080" style="s2">you need to like overwhelm other beyond</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.820" end="01:37:07.469" style="s2">mates that may have been there but you</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.080" end="01:37:11.880" style="s2">weren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.469" end="01:37:14.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve at least found personally that some</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.880" end="01:37:15.870" style="s2">people may argue that having an open</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.010" end="01:37:17.940" style="s2">relationship would be the long-term</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.870" end="01:37:20.250" style="s2">detrimental I found for myself that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.940" end="01:37:22.920" style="s2">long term positive and helpful and</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.250" end="01:37:24.300" style="s2">healthy and has only strengthened the</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.920" end="01:37:26.610" style="s2">relationship that I have with my</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.300" end="01:37:28.050" style="s2">girlfriend and you know girlfriend I</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.610" end="01:37:29.760" style="s2">feel like such an understated word for</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.050" end="01:37:34.500" style="s2">the level of commitment and and and</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.760" end="01:37:36.900" style="s2">partnership that we have but are you</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.500" end="01:37:40.500" style="s2">hearing people sort of use that you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.900" end="01:37:44.580" style="s2">that language and see it as a as a sort</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.500" end="01:37:47.040" style="s2">of a sort of a support structure for a</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.580" end="01:37:49.290" style="s2">long-term pair bond yeah I think it can</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.040" end="01:37:51.140" style="s2">absolutely work that way I&#39;m in a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.290" end="01:37:54.510" style="s2">similar situation to you like a</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.140" end="01:37:57.180" style="s2">long-term highly committed but open</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.510" end="01:37:59.550" style="s2">relationship and it can work it requires</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.180" end="01:38:01.410" style="s2">a lot of leveling up there&#39;s a steep</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.550" end="01:38:03.330" style="s2">learning curve it can be very very</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.410" end="01:38:06.180" style="s2">difficult at first particularly because</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.330" end="01:38:11.910" style="s2">society doesn&#39;t offer a lot of support</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.180" end="01:38:14.340" style="s2">and norms and role models for that but I</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.910" end="01:38:16.850" style="s2">think that is the wave of the future</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.340" end="01:38:18.900" style="s2">what confusion what confuses sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.850" end="01:38:21.390" style="s2">traditionalists and conservatives as</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.900" end="01:38:23.880" style="s2">they think if it&#39;s not exclusive it</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.390" end="01:38:26.790" style="s2">can&#39;t by definition be committed mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.880" end="01:38:29.910" style="s2">or if you&#39;re polyed you can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.790" end="01:38:31.469" style="s2">have long-term relationships or if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.910" end="01:38:34.260" style="s2">have an open relationship you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.469" end="01:38:36.870" style="s2">possibly provide stability and structure</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.260" end="01:38:41.040" style="s2">for parenting and that&#39;s empirically</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.870" end="01:38:43.230" style="s2">false a lot of people can do that but</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.040" end="01:38:46.050" style="s2">your deeper point is can it actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.230" end="01:38:48.239" style="s2">enrich and strengthen a relationship for</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.050" end="01:38:50.670" style="s2">it not to be exclusive as long as</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.239" end="01:38:53.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a pretty radical level of</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.670" end="01:38:56.250" style="s2">honesty as long as you negotiate your</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.310" end="01:38:58.770" style="s2">relationship agreements explicitly and</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.250" end="01:39:02.280" style="s2">carefully and you you update them as you</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.770" end="01:39:04.830" style="s2">need to and as long as you as long as</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.280" end="01:39:07.230" style="s2">you choose outside partners also who</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.830" end="01:39:11.790" style="s2">have the same abilities who have the</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.230" end="01:39:13.590" style="s2">experience who can kind of know where</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.790" end="01:39:15.929" style="s2">they fit into your life and you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.590" end="01:39:18.010" style="s2">where you fit into their life</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.929" end="01:39:19.540" style="s2">great you have to be honest with them -</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.010" end="01:39:21.100" style="s2">yeah and you have to you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.540" end="01:39:23.530" style="s2">upfront like on the first date you gotta</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.100" end="01:39:25.330" style="s2">say I am in an open relationship is that</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.530" end="01:39:28.000" style="s2">cool with you or you say it or the first</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.330" end="01:39:30.790" style="s2">time you text them on even before the</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.000" end="01:39:32.040" style="s2">first date yeah yeah well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.790" end="01:39:34.390" style="s2">interesting I want to tie this back to</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.040" end="01:39:36.460" style="s2">sort of our earlier discussions of like</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.390" end="01:39:38.410" style="s2">some game and sort of red pill stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.460" end="01:39:40.449" style="s2">what I have always understood about game</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.410" end="01:39:42.340" style="s2">which I think it&#39;s a bad rap it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.449" end="01:39:45.730" style="s2">talking about sort of pick up stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.340" end="01:39:48.760" style="s2">really what it is is a signaling to your</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.730" end="01:39:50.770" style="s2">partner that you have certain traits</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.760" end="01:39:52.660" style="s2">that they should find attractive and I</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.770" end="01:39:54.540" style="s2">think men that are just beginning their</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.660" end="01:39:57.760" style="s2">sort of self-improvement journey</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.540" end="01:39:59.890" style="s2">need to find ways to signal that they</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.760" end="01:40:02.440" style="s2">have high levels of fitness to borrow</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.890" end="01:40:04.120" style="s2">phrase when they may not be all the way</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.440" end="01:40:06.790" style="s2">there just yet and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.120" end="01:40:09.070" style="s2">okay and one of the things that came</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.790" end="01:40:11.530" style="s2">comes up in talks in the sort of game</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.070" end="01:40:16.330" style="s2">circles is that you know in order to</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.530" end="01:40:19.060" style="s2">keep your your partner excited about you</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.330" end="01:40:21.370" style="s2">one way to do it is for her to see that</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.060" end="01:40:24.400" style="s2">other people still find you attractive</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.370" end="01:40:26.380" style="s2">and so I think that some guys that will</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.400" end="01:40:28.030" style="s2">call that like spinning plates or you</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.380" end="01:40:30.010" style="s2">know other phrases but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.030" end="01:40:31.660" style="s2">you know just flirt with somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.010" end="01:40:33.280" style="s2">in this in a supermarket and your wife</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.660" end="01:40:35.320" style="s2">will see it and she&#39;ll be turned on and</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.280" end="01:40:36.640" style="s2">it&#39;ll still got some some spark to it</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.320" end="01:40:39.760" style="s2">and I guess that this the open</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.640" end="01:40:42.190" style="s2">relationship for me does the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.760" end="01:40:44.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s really curious because you go</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.190" end="01:40:47.020" style="s2">out into the market the sex market and</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.320" end="01:40:48.340" style="s2">you get another data point you know for</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.020" end="01:40:50.410" style="s2">yourself and you get another data point</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.340" end="01:40:52.900" style="s2">for your partner and for me it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.410" end="01:40:55.150" style="s2">just been such a wonderful confirmation</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.900" end="01:40:57.760" style="s2">of how wonderful amazing my relationship</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.150" end="01:40:59.230" style="s2">is and how much I love her and how hot</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.760" end="01:41:01.360" style="s2">everything is and how we want to</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.230" end="01:41:03.010" style="s2">continue doing that and so I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.360" end="01:41:06.520" style="s2">seen sort of the civil ushion airy</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.010" end="01:41:08.620" style="s2">component to you know the competitive</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.520" end="01:41:10.750" style="s2">nature of the sexual marketplace as</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.620" end="01:41:13.440" style="s2">being a benefit to preserving your</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.750" end="01:41:15.940" style="s2">long-term spark which in turn will then</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.440" end="01:41:17.770" style="s2">give you a more stable long-term</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.940" end="01:41:19.390" style="s2">relationship which would be better for</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.770" end="01:41:20.590" style="s2">your kids better for the economy better</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.390" end="01:41:23.770" style="s2">for all this thing and so I guess this</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.590" end="01:41:25.960" style="s2">is a long way of me saying the game and</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.770" end="01:41:26.560" style="s2">sort of even the tease of an open</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.960" end="01:41:28.990" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.560" end="01:41:30.940" style="s2">it&#39;s good to be good for good for the</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.990" end="01:41:32.380" style="s2">country in the long term and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.940" end="01:41:33.700" style="s2">another one of these components that</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.380" end="01:41:35.110" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about like how are we</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.700" end="01:41:36.970" style="s2">going to manage our relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.110" end="01:41:40.180" style="s2">ourselves as men in this environment</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.970" end="01:41:43.030" style="s2">that is attacking masculinity attacking</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.180" end="01:41:44.290" style="s2">the expressions of manhood and power and</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.030" end="01:41:46.630" style="s2">dominance and all the things that we&#39;ve</p>
