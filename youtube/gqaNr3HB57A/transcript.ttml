<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:22.130" style="s2">okay well Nora I remember when we spoke</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">to each other we were in a convent</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.130" end="00:00:28.350" style="s2">surrounded by groups of people eating</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:32.099" style="s2">with their families and a bunch of trees</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.350" end="00:00:33.510" style="s2">and you were just off to somewhere that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.099" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">I was thinking of my mind is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.510" end="00:00:39.090" style="s2">like a forest by a river to do a warm</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:42.780" style="s2">data lab and I really appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:46.019" style="s2">meeting you then and I hoped we would</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.780" end="00:00:52.049" style="s2">talk again and and it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.019" end="00:00:55.019" style="s2">thing to find ourselves in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.049" end="00:01:03.269" style="s2">now given some of the developments of of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.019" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">the world and I&#39;m I&#39;m glad to be here</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.269" end="00:01:13.649" style="s2">with the opportunity to ask a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:17.630" style="s2">questions and to share with some with</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.649" end="00:01:17.630" style="s2">the world with with people</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:34.700" style="s2">a little bit of as something we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:34.700" style="s2">presence to help steady and realize</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.060" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">perhaps a way to be grounded a way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.210" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">make effective choices and to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">to come into a way of being in integrity</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:59.789" style="s2">with each other so that&#39;s my sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:01.939" style="s2">hope that&#39;s why I&#39;m wanting to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.789" end="00:02:01.939" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.570" end="00:02:10.840" style="s2">and how how</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.430" end="00:02:19.910" style="s2">how would you characterize</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:23.720" style="s2">your world at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:38.220" style="s2">I just want to say first of all Tim that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.120" end="00:02:41.670" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;m most appreciating</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:45.500" style="s2">about the question you just asked is how</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.670" end="00:02:49.490" style="s2">what a struggle it was to articulate and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.500" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">I think that that actually is important</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.490" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">because I&#39;ve we&#39;ve had it interviews</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:03:04.940" style="s2">conversations before and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:09.300" style="s2">that&#39;s not your normal pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.940" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">communication and and I&#39;m I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.300" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">really serious about this because one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:19.530" style="s2">the most important things that that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">can do right now is to put in check some</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.530" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">of those more rehearsed scripts and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">certainly the trajectories of where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">all were three and a half weeks ago and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:35.180" style="s2">so I what I heard most of all in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:38.520" style="s2">question is that the trajectory is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.180" end="00:03:41.520" style="s2">moving and and I think that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.520" end="00:03:43.800" style="s2">sign that you&#39;re paying attention what</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.520" end="00:03:46.740" style="s2">I&#39;m most worried about right now are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.800" end="00:03:49.800" style="s2">people whose trajectories are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.740" end="00:03:52.950" style="s2">changing who are trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.800" end="00:03:57.270" style="s2">how to position themselves in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.950" end="00:04:00.980" style="s2">moment how to platform this this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.270" end="00:04:07.320" style="s2">into the right post or podcast how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.980" end="00:04:12.330" style="s2">you know catch the next meme or I even</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.320" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">jump on the latest news story and I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.330" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">I think for me one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">is in view is just how important it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">to be in a heightened state of attention</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:31.110" style="s2">to the fact that there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:34.590" style="s2">changing and that the game of three</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:37.710" style="s2">weeks ago is not the game of now so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.590" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">generating of status the the you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:44.040" style="s2">all of that stuff is in a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:45.470" style="s2">frame and it&#39;s actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.040" end="00:04:50.419" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.470" end="00:04:50.419" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy for everyone to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.300" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">it&#39;s just not our</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.320" end="00:05:04.410" style="s2">remember you know plans change and when</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:07.230" style="s2">plans change there&#39;s a lot of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.410" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">around that and everybody&#39;s plans just</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.230" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">changed completely you know seniors in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">high school that are getting ready to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:19.290" style="s2">graduate can&#39;t graduate and people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:21.240" style="s2">had weddings planned and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.290" end="00:05:23.100" style="s2">you know then there&#39;s the the people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.240" end="00:05:25.050" style="s2">are just trying to feed their kids and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.100" end="00:05:27.480" style="s2">get through the day people you know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.050" end="00:05:29.930" style="s2">think domestic abuse is on a serious</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.480" end="00:05:32.430" style="s2">spike right now people who have</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.930" end="00:05:37.050" style="s2">difficult home lives and are stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.430" end="00:05:40.110" style="s2">the house so there&#39;s there&#39;s the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.050" end="00:05:43.310" style="s2">questions too of what&#39;s what&#39;s swirling</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.110" end="00:05:46.590" style="s2">out there how is this going to land and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:50.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not we&#39;re not close to seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.590" end="00:05:52.710" style="s2">yet so you know I think the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.430" end="00:05:56.010" style="s2">that can really be done right now is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.710" end="00:06:00.840" style="s2">just to pay attention and to to pay</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.010" end="00:06:04.230" style="s2">attention with as much kindness and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.840" end="00:06:10.260" style="s2">care for yourself and others as you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.230" end="00:06:11.790" style="s2">and there are big strategic pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.260" end="00:06:13.790" style="s2">have to get put in place you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.790" end="00:06:17.310" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff that the governments are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.790" end="00:06:19.200" style="s2">showing up for maybe yours is doing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.310" end="00:06:21.720" style="s2">little better but I mean for the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.200" end="00:06:24.540" style="s2">part it seems like the general political</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.720" end="00:06:32.060" style="s2">framework is as a at least ten days to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.540" end="00:06:32.060" style="s2">two weeks late on their shutdowns so</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.770" end="00:06:37.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what I said</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.760" end="00:06:39.450" style="s2">at the beginning of this before you turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.740" end="00:06:43.260" style="s2">the record button on I&#39;ll say again</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.450" end="00:06:48.990" style="s2">which is that I in our family we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.260" end="00:06:55.710" style="s2">already dealing with with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.990" end="00:07:00.360" style="s2">in serious condition so it&#39;s no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.710" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">just a time to be home and read and be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.360" end="00:07:07.410" style="s2">with the kids this is not just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:14.700" style="s2">vacation or you know this is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.410" end="00:07:16.290" style="s2">there&#39;s another wave coming and people</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.700" end="00:07:17.940" style="s2">in Italy will tell you about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.290" end="00:07:23.210" style="s2">where you have to say goodbye to people</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.910" end="00:08:12.360" style="s2">the other piece of it of how to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.510" end="00:08:15.780" style="s2">those conversations you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.360" end="00:08:17.730" style="s2">have those conversations across families</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.780" end="00:08:19.080" style="s2">and well it&#39;s probably better you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:08:25.620" end="00:08:31.050" style="s2">hurtful things happening right now and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.630" end="00:08:33.570" style="s2">so I guess there&#39;s there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.050" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">beautiful need for community and for</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.570" end="00:08:40.130" style="s2">contact and in the midst of this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:40.130" style="s2">this other layer to of just</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.070" end="00:08:43.130" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.860" end="00:08:47.670" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.670" end="00:08:52.760" style="s2">not reckless that&#39;s all I want to be is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.890" end="00:08:52.760" style="s2">not reckless</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.110" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">yeah yeah the experience I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.420" end="00:09:36.410" style="s2">right now is I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:39.570" style="s2">microcosm of the challenge I&#39;m facing</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.410" end="00:09:44.360" style="s2">most days and I think a challenge upon</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.570" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">all of us and I mean right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.360" end="00:09:50.850" style="s2">it just so happens that in the last 15</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:54.180" style="s2">minutes 20 minutes of my life that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.850" end="00:09:58.460" style="s2">challenge to be together is very</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.770" end="00:10:14.740" style="s2">committed to be with this process and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:20.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not and and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.740" end="00:10:24.580" style="s2">you make his is deeply involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.520" end="00:10:28.330" style="s2">there was something you said to me about</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.580" end="00:10:32.290" style="s2">when we spoke for four or five months</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.330" end="00:10:40.930" style="s2">ago about what does it mean to share</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.290" end="00:10:42.310" style="s2">voice and I am deeply interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.930" end="00:10:43.000" style="s2">question but not from an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.310" end="00:10:47.459" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.000" end="00:10:57.660" style="s2">I&#39;m deeply interested in the being with</p>

<p begin="00:10:57.660" end="00:11:11.339" style="s2">presencing what is and when what is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.350" end="00:11:11.339" style="s2">threatening overwhelm this is when</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.209" end="00:11:19.950" style="s2">integrity is most challenged and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.510" end="00:11:26.450" style="s2">groundedness is challenged by definition</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.950" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">and so that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.450" end="00:11:38.450" style="s2">feeling and perhaps what does it look</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.470" end="00:11:48.380" style="s2">like to express in a way and to act in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.450" end="00:11:51.500" style="s2">way that isn&#39;t reckless I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.380" end="00:11:55.820" style="s2">for one thing it&#39;s about asking the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.500" end="00:11:59.450" style="s2">question again and again another thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.820" end="00:12:04.120" style="s2">is understanding that there are patterns</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.450" end="00:12:07.970" style="s2">and ways of perceiving that are so</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.120" end="00:12:10.730" style="s2">ingrained that they&#39;re very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.970" end="00:12:13.340" style="s2">change and they&#39;re gonna change unevenly</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.730" end="00:12:15.740" style="s2">so what you&#39;re able to perceive and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.340" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">your neighbor is able to perceive may be</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.740" end="00:12:23.480" style="s2">very very different so you may be</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:26.360" style="s2">perceiving the importance of of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.480" end="00:12:29.240" style="s2">watching out for you know quarantine but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.360" end="00:12:32.330" style="s2">other people may not actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.240" end="00:12:36.740" style="s2">perceive yet how important that is and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.330" end="00:12:38.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s frustrating to have these kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.740" end="00:12:40.750" style="s2">of trajectories of yeah but when are we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.450" end="00:12:44.030" style="s2">gonna go back to business as usual right</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.750" end="00:12:47.630" style="s2">now if you&#39;re you know even remotely</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.870" end="00:13:23.470" style="s2">how of being in it is so critical</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.140" end="00:13:27.300" style="s2">because it is every move we make is a</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.060" end="00:16:15.490" style="s2">that the the the way that we sorted out</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.300" end="00:16:18.510" style="s2">what was essential had to do with a</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:13.190" style="s2">because I right now I</p>

<p begin="00:21:31.700" end="00:21:41.490" style="s2">it&#39;s that as I&#39;m confronted with the</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.490" end="00:21:53.540" style="s2">suffering and that is a dynamic that we</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.540" end="00:22:00.620" style="s2">play and our involvement in it I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">most of us if we look deep enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.620" end="00:22:22.100" style="s2">because the depths of what hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:27.800" style="s2">the the depths of the pain of life have</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.100" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">been you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.800" end="00:22:39.020" style="s2">wanted at many points in my life to</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.020" end="00:22:45.830" style="s2">reality of that and realized that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.480" end="00:22:52.390" style="s2">is a potentiality of experience for all</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.830" end="00:22:52.390" style="s2">human beings and the dynamic of</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.620" end="00:23:14.360" style="s2">is the pattern of doing that seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.290" end="00:23:16.730" style="s2">to involve it&#39;s kind of kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.360" end="00:23:19.040" style="s2">this I feel and and I&#39;m not saying this</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.730" end="00:23:20.990" style="s2">because I I in the following metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.040" end="00:23:23.630" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I know to be true and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:35.320" style="s2">really couldn&#39;t have a higher opinion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.650" end="00:23:35.320" style="s2">you Nora from the time we spent together</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.380" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">it seems to me we can drown in a puddle</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.170" end="00:23:43.460" style="s2">or we can drown in an ocean and from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:47.500" style="s2">perspective of the person who drowns</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.460" end="00:23:47.500" style="s2">they are more or less the same and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.650" end="00:23:53.030" style="s2">therefore the dynamic of how we deal</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.360" end="00:24:01.370" style="s2">with our respective puddles becomes of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.030" end="00:24:01.929" style="s2">paramount importance and I it&#39;s it can</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.370" end="00:24:06.610" style="s2">be so</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.929" end="00:24:12.419" style="s2">challenging to be capable of taking the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.610" end="00:24:16.539" style="s2">suffering of the world in and remaining</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.419" end="00:24:25.169" style="s2">grounded enough to still be in an</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.539" end="00:24:30.220" style="s2">effective place of decision-making and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.169" end="00:24:33.100" style="s2">just I felt I felt the urge to say this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.220" end="00:24:41.169" style="s2">because otherwise I&#39;d be leaving</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.100" end="00:24:46.409" style="s2">something out yeah I think you know you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.169" end="00:24:53.409" style="s2">there&#39;s always a context mm-hmm and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.409" end="00:24:55.330" style="s2">that context matters and it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.409" end="00:24:59.700" style="s2">said I think that the thing here is</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.330" end="00:25:06.580" style="s2">about decision-making in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.700" end="00:25:12.970" style="s2">what kind of wherewithal what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.580" end="00:25:20.409" style="s2">perception what sort of how you said</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.970" end="00:25:22.299" style="s2">groundedness is in place there because</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.409" end="00:25:25.740" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s all these decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.299" end="00:25:29.559" style="s2">then they&#39;re so contradictory right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.740" end="00:25:33.009" style="s2">everything is is it my mother used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.559" end="00:25:37.269" style="s2">say at sixes and sevens everything is in</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.009" end="00:25:39.519" style="s2">direct contradiction we have to bring we</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.269" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">have to get we have to be together but</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.519" end="00:25:43.419" style="s2">we can&#39;t be together</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:45.730" style="s2">we have to be apart we have to support</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.419" end="00:25:48.759" style="s2">each other but we can&#39;t touch each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.730" end="00:25:51.039" style="s2">we can&#39;t be near each other we have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.759" end="00:25:54.009" style="s2">and you know on the one hand that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.039" end="00:25:56.770" style="s2">philosophical dilemma but when it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.009" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">your mother</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.770" end="00:26:02.020" style="s2">or someone who you love that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:04.060" style="s2">hospital that contradiction you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.020" end="00:26:05.860" style="s2">like you said a puddle or an ocean it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.060" end="00:26:08.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re at the door of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.860" end="00:26:10.810" style="s2">the hospital or on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.050" end="00:26:19.690" style="s2">world you can&#39;t go in to be with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.810" end="00:26:26.040" style="s2">person you cannot be near them and so do</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.690" end="00:26:28.990" style="s2">we like what is continuing right now I</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.040" end="00:26:31.720" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really big question what</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.990" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">does it mean to continue what are we</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.720" end="00:26:38.440" style="s2">continuing and what are we not</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:45.580" style="s2">continuing and and how do those things</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.440" end="00:26:47.950" style="s2">start to interlace as as this these</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.580" end="00:26:49.330" style="s2">larger pieces are moving and and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.950" end="00:26:56.020" style="s2">know there&#39;s things that are getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.330" end="00:27:01.090" style="s2">ratcheted up into full-tilt it war</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.020" end="00:27:05.530" style="s2">strategy language complete with military</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.090" end="00:27:09.820" style="s2">assistance and so on and and keeping</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.530" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">keeping there clear a head and heart and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.820" end="00:27:19.570" style="s2">that is is not easy for anyone but but</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:21.640" style="s2">also were we&#39;re triggering back into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.570" end="00:27:25.210" style="s2">world that made sense that you know this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.640" end="00:27:27.850" style="s2">is so bizarre I think we all have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.210" end="00:27:30.150" style="s2">ourselves several times a day is you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.850" end="00:27:32.410" style="s2">know unless you&#39;re really in the throes</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.150" end="00:27:35.800" style="s2">like the medical people in the medical</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.410" end="00:27:38.920" style="s2">profession there&#39;s a lot of is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.800" end="00:27:41.500" style="s2">really happening going on you know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.920" end="00:27:45.540" style="s2">see those those photographs of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.500" end="00:27:50.340" style="s2">partying at the beach and just you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.540" end="00:27:50.340" style="s2">vectors it&#39;s a vector party</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.790" end="00:27:58.100" style="s2">and so it&#39;s the is this really happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.700" end="00:28:01.010" style="s2">thing and then what does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.100" end="00:28:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s happening how what what you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.010" end="00:28:07.229" style="s2">where where are the lines I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.160" end="00:28:07.229" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.480" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">but there&#39;s a good thing of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.890" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">essential and it has been possible to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:21.860" style="s2">justify that what was essential to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:25.430" style="s2">people was not essential to others in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.860" end="00:28:30.290" style="s2">the system that that that has been in</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.430" end="00:28:34.430" style="s2">play and right now the cost of that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.290" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">coming up large and visible to those who</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.430" end="00:28:43.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t want or couldn&#39;t see it before</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:47.540" style="s2">but the cost of of exploitation was more</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.940" end="00:28:50.330" style="s2">than everything and so the wealth that</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.540" end="00:28:54.230" style="s2">was gained on it it doesn&#39;t have worth</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.330" end="00:28:56.120" style="s2">any more and it I think we&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.260" end="00:29:16.250" style="s2">that the food that we get at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.560" end="00:29:19.370" style="s2">supermarket is actually produced by</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.250" end="00:29:21.140" style="s2">people the tops of these industries are</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.370" end="00:29:24.140" style="s2">filled with gazillionaires and the</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.140" end="00:29:29.300" style="s2">picking and the tending and the actual</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.230" end="00:29:32.180" style="s2">work with our food is done by people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.300" end="00:29:34.780" style="s2">can barely feed their own children there</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.180" end="00:29:34.780" style="s2">was a cost</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.059" end="00:29:49.149" style="s2">not what-what-what producing life should</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.129" end="00:29:59.549" style="s2">in in ways that have been extremely</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.440" end="00:30:02.200" style="s2">destructive across all of our systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.549" end="00:30:06.279" style="s2">economic education health I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.200" end="00:30:10.210" style="s2">every direction and the biggest one is</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.279" end="00:30:14.499" style="s2">actually identity because that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.210" end="00:30:16.419" style="s2">all of these come together and so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.499" end="00:30:19.539" style="s2">know when I see those kids at the beach</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.419" end="00:30:21.909" style="s2">or when my you know people that are</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.059" end="00:31:30.879" style="s2">about something but it&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.119" end="00:31:34.539" style="s2">all together when all these systems at</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.879" end="00:31:37.769" style="s2">once start to come unraveled because</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.539" end="00:31:41.080" style="s2">there&#39;s second and third order</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.769" end="00:31:43.899" style="s2">contingencies and interdependencies that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.080" end="00:31:45.669" style="s2">we&#39;re holding not just the economic or</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.899" end="00:31:48.429" style="s2">the education or the health system in</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.669" end="00:31:51.850" style="s2">place they were holding entire cultural</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.429" end="00:31:54.580" style="s2">ideas of what the future is or what</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.850" end="00:31:58.840" style="s2">success is or what wealth is or what</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.580" end="00:32:00.970" style="s2">health is or what family is or you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:03.639" style="s2">these things that we&#39;re running much</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.970" end="00:32:06.250" style="s2">much deeper than the actual structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.639" end="00:32:10.649" style="s2">and policies and things that could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.250" end="00:32:13.210" style="s2">measured and detailed and defined and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.649" end="00:32:16.809" style="s2">there&#39;s the changes that are taking</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.210" end="00:32:21.460" style="s2">place are taking place across and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.809" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">through multiple contexts now and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.460" end="00:32:25.570" style="s2">why it&#39;s difficult to find words for</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:30.220" style="s2">them we don&#39;t even really have words for</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.570" end="00:32:32.110" style="s2">that liminal space but when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.220" end="00:32:35.080" style="s2">about what&#39;s continuing and what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.110" end="00:32:38.169" style="s2">continuing the things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.080" end="00:32:43.659" style="s2">continuing are are so deeply entrenched</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.169" end="00:32:45.490" style="s2">that it&#39;s hard to even from for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.659" end="00:32:47.190" style="s2">people right now it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.490" end="00:32:51.220" style="s2">see where they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.190" end="00:32:57.210" style="s2">so I mean can you imagine right now for</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.220" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">example a world in which it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.210" end="00:33:07.899" style="s2">to buy a first-class plane ticket to a</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.490" end="00:33:30.850" style="s2">and tentacles in which those things were</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.539" end="00:33:35.379" style="s2">wrapped so that they did make sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.850" end="00:33:40.240" style="s2">last month those all those lines and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.379" end="00:33:44.590" style="s2">tentacles have gotten at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.240" end="00:33:46.869" style="s2">reframed for some people I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.590" end="00:33:48.940" style="s2">for everyone yet but I think it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.869" end="00:33:52.809" style="s2">quickly and I don&#39;t you know I I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.210" end="00:35:13.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a good idea to be destructive or</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.339" end="00:35:17.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s essential to be destructive</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.950" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">but I I do think that we need to be very</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.560" end="00:35:23.770" style="s2">careful with where we draw the judgment</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:26.079" style="s2">around how people are trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.770" end="00:35:28.330" style="s2">out how to be in a world that&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.079" end="00:35:31.660" style="s2">this fast</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.330" end="00:35:35.620" style="s2">yeah and that comes down to the people</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.060" end="00:35:44.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff out there about</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.770" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">you know this is about people who can do</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.350" end="00:35:51.480" style="s2">exponential math and people who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:55.030" style="s2">but even that is a wild</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.480" end="00:35:58.350" style="s2">oversimplification it&#39;s it&#39;s how do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.030" end="00:36:01.750" style="s2">hold this my mother is 91 and she&#39;s in a</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.870" end="00:36:30.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a pretty good chance that I</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.959" end="00:37:12.989" style="s2">completely stuck in her little one-room</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.499" end="00:37:14.789" style="s2">apartment and maintaining like I I have</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.989" end="00:37:17.489" style="s2">to live with myself I gotta put my</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.789" end="00:37:19.349" style="s2">eyebrows on or I just I mean I got I</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.159" end="00:37:41.269" style="s2">I do that so whatever it takes but at</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.669" end="00:37:44.189" style="s2">the same time this is coming in hard and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.269" end="00:37:46.919" style="s2">I I think the thing I&#39;m really worried</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.189" end="00:37:49.799" style="s2">about is just how to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.919" end="00:37:54.119" style="s2">aloneness and dealing with huge change</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.799" end="00:37:57.929" style="s2">and massive trauma in aloneness and this</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.119" end="00:38:03.109" style="s2">is so not where we are built for I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.929" end="00:38:06.589" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re creatures that rely on</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.109" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">contact physical emotional</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.589" end="00:38:11.819" style="s2">communicational familial cultural I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:15.689" style="s2">every single thing in our world is made</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.819" end="00:38:18.229" style="s2">of togetherness yeah yeah so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.689" end="00:38:21.390" style="s2">piece I&#39;m really concerned about is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.229" end="00:38:24.869" style="s2">that&#39;s the essential that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.390" end="00:38:26.699" style="s2">essential yep and and without that</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.869" end="00:38:29.939" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a lot of other weird</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.699" end="00:38:31.919" style="s2">essentials yeah what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.939" end="00:38:35.579" style="s2">replacements are we gonna put him in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.919" end="00:38:44.269" style="s2">there so that we can talk on zoom&#39; or we</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.579" end="00:38:44.269" style="s2">can I mean yeah so if somebody needs to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.359" end="00:38:49.279" style="s2">smoke some cigarettes or have a drink I</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.809" end="00:38:53.029" style="s2">don&#39;t think I have much judgment around</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.279" end="00:38:57.109" style="s2">it right now I mean I think we just</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.029" end="00:39:01.940" style="s2">gotta get through this yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.109" end="00:39:12.650" style="s2">that&#39;s a perfectly fair point more than</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.940" end="00:39:15.230" style="s2">fair the e the e so there&#39;s these double</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.650" end="00:39:18.319" style="s2">bonds or attentions that we are always</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.230" end="00:39:21.559" style="s2">dealing with and we have here then this</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.319" end="00:39:27.099" style="s2">relationship between a judgment and non</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.559" end="00:39:30.319" style="s2">judgment and we have also the notions of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.099" end="00:39:33.079" style="s2">openings and closures which to me is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.319" end="00:39:37.849" style="s2">essentially something like choices which</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.079" end="00:39:43.069" style="s2">have consequences and and then what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.849" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">the process of making choices that open</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.069" end="00:39:48.529" style="s2">the way perhaps more than they close it</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:50.569" style="s2">unless the clothes precludes</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.529" end="00:39:52.390" style="s2">possibilities that we actually might</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.569" end="00:39:57.160" style="s2">want to keep open what is worth</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.390" end="00:40:01.309" style="s2">continuing we have these notions of</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.309" end="00:40:05.499" style="s2">put something nice he said the other day</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:21.839" style="s2">other words for me it is how to be with</p>

<p begin="00:41:39.660" end="00:41:46.460" style="s2">far as to say that the sort of abject</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.119" end="00:42:10.380" style="s2">you know people were seeking the the</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.249" end="00:42:28.910" style="s2">gotten very weird and so out of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.049" end="00:42:34.519" style="s2">weird concoction there&#39;s suddenly a need</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.910" end="00:42:34.519" style="s2">to be able to clear all that nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.950" end="00:42:43.890" style="s2">those weird lines of I&#39;ve been signed</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.240" end="00:42:46.290" style="s2">out huh are you here still yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.890" end="00:42:49.410" style="s2">I just got a note that said I was signed</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.290" end="00:42:54.180" style="s2">out but we have to clear all this</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.410" end="00:42:58.440" style="s2">nonsense of past of things weird you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.180" end="00:43:02.940" style="s2">know totally entwined in and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.440" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">remember something that is something</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.940" end="00:43:06.680" style="s2">that the compost pile knows better than</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:09.380" style="s2">I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.680" end="00:43:13.740" style="s2">which is actually how to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.380" end="00:43:15.869" style="s2">relationships that build life and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.740" end="00:43:20.369" style="s2">honestly have never lived in a world</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.869" end="00:43:23.880" style="s2">where the that was the essential thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.369" end="00:43:26.760" style="s2">to do I&#39;ve never been to that world</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.880" end="00:43:29.490" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been to the forest and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.760" end="00:43:31.740" style="s2">so I&#39;ve seen it there I try my best with</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.490" end="00:43:37.140" style="s2">my family and the work that I do as you</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.740" end="00:43:39.480" style="s2">know but but also I you know I like you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.140" end="00:43:42.869" style="s2">I mean here we are were several</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.480" end="00:43:47.670" style="s2">generations in two ways in which our</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.869" end="00:43:53.640" style="s2">physiological processes are digesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.670" end="00:43:57.829" style="s2">proteins or manifesting desires or have</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.640" end="00:43:57.829" style="s2">intimate longings for</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.660" end="00:44:09.720" style="s2">things that are and ways of being that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.010" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">are located in a system of systems that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.720" end="00:44:18.359" style="s2">was non vitalizing hmm and now we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:21.990" style="s2">to suddenly wake up and know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.359" end="00:44:24.200" style="s2">essential and we don&#39;t know we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.990" end="00:44:32.099" style="s2">essential yeah okay essential I</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.200" end="00:44:34.170" style="s2">definitely need face cream right I gotta</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.099" end="00:44:37.589" style="s2">get a Paula bourbon like these are</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.170" end="00:44:39.900" style="s2">essential things and I mean I&#39;m laughing</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.589" end="00:44:44.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not funny but I&#39;m laughing because</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.900" end="00:44:48.150" style="s2">of the I guess surrealism of it all</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.430" end="00:44:51.480" style="s2">the absurdity is just vast but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.150" end="00:44:54.119" style="s2">think I like that that sort of framing</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.480" end="00:44:59.069" style="s2">there that the compost knows more about</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.119" end="00:45:00.349" style="s2">how to be in a world of vitalizing</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.069" end="00:45:03.780" style="s2">relationships than I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.349" end="00:45:06.089" style="s2">hmm because I have been in cultured into</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.780" end="00:45:08.490" style="s2">a lot of processes that have blinded me</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.089" end="00:45:10.740" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.490" end="00:45:13.260" style="s2">and that have been served by</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.740" end="00:45:17.819" style="s2">exploitation that was beyond where I</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.260" end="00:45:19.980" style="s2">could see conveniently hmm and so I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.819" end="00:45:29.190" style="s2">this idea of essentialness that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.980" end="00:45:34.589" style="s2">connected to brokenness so the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.190" end="00:45:40.920" style="s2">what you say is it&#39;s it&#39;s so evident to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.589" end="00:45:46.829" style="s2">me and I&#39;m also feeling the urge to clay</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.920" end="00:45:51.990" style="s2">here what I consider the another side of</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.829" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">the dance and with with many people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.990" end="00:46:00.750" style="s2">I respect and delve deeply into the more</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:04.650" style="s2">mystical kind of metaphors of making</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.750" end="00:46:07.020" style="s2">sense of the nature of our experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.650" end="00:46:09.809" style="s2">and the interconnectedness of the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.020" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">this often takes this often occurs and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.809" end="00:46:14.380" style="s2">often find myself being on well it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.960" end="00:46:22.450" style="s2">be different sides of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.380" end="00:46:23.890" style="s2">but often often um often a side of well</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.450" end="00:46:25.780" style="s2">I&#39;ll leave that for now and just and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.890" end="00:46:31.960" style="s2">just say what what came up to me into</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.780" end="00:46:35.350" style="s2">presence because because it&#39;s I think a</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.960" end="00:46:35.980" style="s2">sobering thing for you to say what you</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.350" end="00:46:39.250" style="s2">just said</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.980" end="00:46:42.790" style="s2">that that that compost knows more about</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.250" end="00:46:52.170" style="s2">how to be in touch with vitalizing</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.790" end="00:46:54.820" style="s2">relationships and yet yet there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.170" end="00:46:58.390" style="s2">sense here that I&#39;m experiencing right</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.820" end="00:47:00.490" style="s2">now like the very act of and we can use</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.390" end="00:47:02.680" style="s2">this as an example the very act of being</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.490" end="00:47:05.640" style="s2">here I can reflect on the transition</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.680" end="00:47:08.290" style="s2">here of my own state and as as</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.640" end="00:47:12.220" style="s2">uncomfortable I am in even reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.290" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">the sort of the coming into this</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.220" end="00:47:18.940" style="s2">conversation in a cycle of agency that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:22.090" style="s2">was diminished and I had to really</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.940" end="00:47:25.120" style="s2">present the vulnerability of my emotion</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.090" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">in order for the connection between us</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.120" end="00:47:33.100" style="s2">to be coherent for you to get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:38.260" style="s2">who I am and where I&#39;m at and inform</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.100" end="00:47:42.310" style="s2">this that process is is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.260" end="00:47:45.880" style="s2">process of a vitalizing relationship yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.310" end="00:47:47.500" style="s2">it is and that&#39;s the thing we are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.880" end="00:47:50.380" style="s2">compost we just don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.500" end="00:47:53.500" style="s2">mm-hm that&#39;s piece and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.380" end="00:47:55.600" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying it&#39;s there it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.500" end="00:47:57.640" style="s2">deeply there I mean it&#39;s what we&#39;re made</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.600" end="00:48:01.720" style="s2">of that&#39;s why we don&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.640" end="00:48:04.540" style="s2">anything alone it&#39;s the same piece it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.720" end="00:48:07.150" style="s2">like we&#39;ve been in all these relational</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.540" end="00:48:08.350" style="s2">processes all along we just identified</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.150" end="00:48:12.610" style="s2">them very weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.350" end="00:48:18.070" style="s2">and now those weirdnesses are melting</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.610" end="00:48:22.210" style="s2">and we&#39;re that&#39;s what is the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.070" end="00:48:24.490" style="s2">point I think that the zone here is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.210" end="00:48:26.680" style="s2">that it may be possible for there to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.490" end="00:48:30.820" style="s2">discovery</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.680" end="00:48:36.120" style="s2">as well yeah but you know we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.820" end="00:48:45.070" style="s2">yes okay well with you it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.120" end="00:48:47.080" style="s2">weaknesses yes we do we do not what are</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.070" end="00:48:50.380" style="s2">we some hundreds of trillions of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.080" end="00:48:57.850" style="s2">organisms we are that we are vitality</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.380" end="00:49:00.970" style="s2">mm-hmm just infused hmm well that there</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.850" end="00:49:03.250" style="s2">is a beautiful place to to end this so</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.970" end="00:49:07.450" style="s2">noir thank you much for thank you so</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.250" end="00:49:11.140" style="s2">much for taking more than than more time</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.450" end="00:49:14.500" style="s2">than then could have been but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.140" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">appreciate you being here thank you Tim</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.500" end="00:49:26.050" style="s2">and I I just want to end by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:28.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of doing here that needs</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.050" end="00:49:32.320" style="s2">to be done there&#39;s a lot of doing and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.840" end="00:49:35.620" style="s2">also needs to hold the time of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.320" end="00:49:37.510" style="s2">reflection and and rethinking reap you</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.620" end="00:49:40.420" style="s2">know to be careful that the doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.510" end="00:49:43.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t become an extension of the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.420" end="00:49:47.470" style="s2">of being that&#39;s in change that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.660" end="00:49:49.240" style="s2">getting reorganized so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.470" end="00:49:53.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the main thing is there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.240" end="00:49:56.320" style="s2">of urgency and it&#39;s gonna take if every</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.860" end="00:49:59.710" style="s2">urgency that we go into we go into</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.320" end="00:50:06.040" style="s2">thinking about whether how can we save</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.710" end="00:50:12.210" style="s2">this emergency in a way that also builds</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.040" end="00:50:15.190" style="s2">vitality hmm right that is a piece okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.210" end="00:50:17.560" style="s2">well I think that requires some further</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.190" end="00:50:20.110" style="s2">further discussion and perhaps we can do</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.560" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">that with John in a couple days time so</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.110" end="00:50:28.900" style="s2">I will be there for that one I promise</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">you so I will send a invite for that so</p>
