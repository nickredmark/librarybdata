<p begin="00:00:19.029" end="00:00:22.438" style="s2">Guess the first thing I&#39;d like to just ask you is how are you doing?</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.990" end="00:00:28.889" style="s2">I&#39;m doing great. So what what&#39;s great about what what you&#39;re doing? What&#39;s so good about your life?</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.769" end="00:00:36.268" style="s2">Well right now I&#39;m in the process of putting together my next stand-up comedy special</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.269" end="00:00:41.789" style="s2">So I&#39;m at the process now where I&#39;ve actually put together a full new hour of material</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.100" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">since my Netflix special which came out in October so</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.330" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s great for me. It&#39;s that&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.000" end="00:00:53.000" style="s2">a relaxing moment because it&#39;s very difficult to put that hour together.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:00:56.650" style="s2">And so it&#39;s and so how do you go about doing that?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.650" end="00:01:03.389" style="s2">A lot of writing a lot of performing a lot of reading a lot of going over notes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.909" end="00:01:06.629" style="s2">examining material a lot of reviewing</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.540" end="00:01:13.409" style="s2">Sets and trying to find out what I like and what I don&#39;t like it&#39;s a long and brutal process system</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.409" end="00:01:18.898" style="s2">It&#39;s the most fun but also the most difficult part of stand-up is the creation of new material</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.899" end="00:01:23.339" style="s2">So how many hours do you think you put in of work to do an hour&#39;s worth stand-up?</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.100" end="00:01:24.800" style="s2">Any idea?</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">That&#39;s a really good question</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.469" end="00:01:33.839" style="s2">It&#39;s usually about I can do I can create a solid ten minutes a month. That&#39;s usually what it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">So it takes me six months to do an hour and in that six months on an average week I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.509" end="00:01:44.788" style="s2">Eight or nine sets so that&#39;s eight or nine</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.969" end="00:01:49.169" style="s2">either half-hour or hours of material</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.810" end="00:01:54.749" style="s2">Sometimes 15 minutes usually an hour depending upon where I&#39;m working and how many other people are on the show</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.630" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">And then a lot of time writing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.020" end="00:02:02.189" style="s2">So you&#39;re doing those sets in front of live audiences all the time? Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.469" end="00:02:06.119" style="s2">Yeah, you have to. Let&#39;s, that&#39;s the weird thing about stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.119" end="00:02:11.729" style="s2">It seems to be that it&#39;s it&#39;s not something that you can do in a vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.729" end="00:02:16.300" style="s2">It has to actually be done. It actually it has to come alive in front of the audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:18.880" style="s2">Like I can I can write in a vacuum,</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.920" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">I can write alone, I can, uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.580" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">contemplate, go over my material, review,</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:30.870" style="s2">edit, I could all sorts of things by myself, but it really doesn&#39;t come alive until it&#39;s in front of an audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.500" end="00:02:34.780" style="s2">Yeah, well, I guess it&#39;s not so easy to figure out what&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">You kind of hope that people will laugh</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:44.780" style="s2">yeah, it&#39;s that, but it&#39;s also there&#39;s a state of mind that you only really achieve when you&#39;re performing in front of an audience and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:48.870" style="s2">You can try to recreate it, but it&#39;ll be fake if you try to do it on your own</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.870" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">I don&#39;t write I don&#39;t write in joke form, like I don&#39;t write the way I say it on stage</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.520" style="s2">I write in sort of a conceptual form.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:05.980" style="s2">I write in an essay form and then I sort of extract things that I think are funny out of that, but they really only</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:11.130" style="s2">find their true the true way I&#39;m going to do them</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.130" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">I only find that in front of an audience because it&#39;s like when the when I&#39;m in front of an audience</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:23.009" style="s2">Then it becomes clear to me how I should and shouldn&#39;t say things based in part on how they&#39;re reacting</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">And based in part on how I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.450" end="00:03:27.719" style="s2">when I&#39;m performing the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.720" end="00:03:32.820" style="s2">Like I find where the the fat of the bit is, and that&#39;s where you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.240" end="00:03:37.600" style="s2">appreciate economy of words and you know what to edit out, and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.600" end="00:03:40.660" style="s2">what to elaborate on, what people aren&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.660" end="00:03:42.800" style="s2">understanding, and what maybe is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.800" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">over-explained, and all that stuff kind of comes together in front of an audience</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.560" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">So the essays that you&#39;re writing or the writing that you&#39;re doing like are they on serious topics? Are they on things you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.280" end="00:03:58.920" style="s2">philosophically or are you trying specifically to be funny or you just trying to get some thoughts down?</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:01.460" style="s2">You know about the way you&#39;re thinking about the world?</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2">Both</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:06.280" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s like the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.320" end="00:04:07.800" style="s2">if, it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.800" end="00:04:12.800" style="s2">See I would say that stand-up comedy, at least the way I do it, it comes in three forms</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.810" end="00:04:18.330" style="s2">Like there&#39;s three steps. In the beginning, you&#39;re really just trying to get laughs, you&#39;re fighting for survival out there. You&#39;re scared</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.430" end="00:04:25.530" style="s2">That&#39;s in the early days of your career. Then you start doing what you think is funny, like things that would make you laugh</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.930" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">But then in stage three</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:30.220" style="s2">you start</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.220" end="00:04:33.089" style="s2">trying to make ideas funny and you try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.970" end="00:04:38.160" style="s2">cleverly introduce ideas into people&#39;s heads that maybe they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.980" end="00:04:46.220" style="s2">entertain without the humor aspect of it. And so when I write, if I write on a subject, whatever the subject might be,</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.840" end="00:04:52.640" style="s2">I write without thinking oh, I have to make each word funny or I have to make each sentence funny</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.000" end="00:04:58.760" style="s2">I write just what are my thoughts on this subject and then along the way I find</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.319" end="00:05:01.979" style="s2">irony and I find</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.860" end="00:05:04.100" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.100" end="00:05:07.980" style="s2">perceptions and all the things that lead to stand-up comedy material</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.100" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">Right, and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:10.100" style="s2">and I extract those</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.100" end="00:05:15.040" style="s2">Right, and how much of their like humor and the whip just occurs to you spontaneously on the stage?</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.420" end="00:05:18.420" style="s2">Sometimes a lot. It depends on the subject</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.729" end="00:05:23.669" style="s2">But it&#39;s always a possibility, some of the best lines that I&#39;ve ever come up with</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.979" end="00:05:30.100" style="s2">in my act to come up with, I come up with on the spot while I&#39;m just talking about things</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.100" end="00:05:34.109" style="s2">Right, well that should be when you&#39;re like into the subject and things are going well with the audience</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.780" end="00:05:37.530" style="s2">Yeah, yeah, that&#39;s basically how it goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.530" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">It&#39;s a tricky business</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:43.720" style="s2">yeah, it sounds like an extremely tricky business and one way the cost of failure is, is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.020" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">humiliation and and and, uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.780" end="00:05:48.219" style="s2">emotional pain</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.219" end="00:05:50.219" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s the worst</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:54.539" style="s2">There&#39;s not that many things that are more embarrassing than like trying to be funny</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.539" end="00:05:58.739" style="s2">Especially if you&#39;ve put say a hundred hours into one hour of preparation</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.740" end="00:06:02.699" style="s2">Which is less than you&#39;re doing and then finding out that you&#39;re just not that amusing</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.600" end="00:06:05.100" style="s2">That doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.100" end="00:06:06.600" style="s2">It&#39;s more common than not</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.860" end="00:06:07.640" style="s2">Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.320" end="00:06:10.680" style="s2">So how many Netflix specials have you done now?</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.620" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve done three and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.630" end="00:06:18.089" style="s2">I&#39;m working on my fourth one right now, but overall I&#39;ve done nine</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.320" end="00:06:25.220" style="s2">different hours of comedy either a comedy album or video special</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.540" end="00:06:29.780" style="s2">What&#39;s it been like working for Netflix?</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:32.060" style="s2">It&#39;s great. They&#39;re very easy.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.060" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">Oh that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.580" end="00:06:37.580" style="s2">Yeah, they they don&#39;t they really don&#39;t have any notes. They just let me</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:38.640" style="s2">You know, fortunately</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.650" end="00:06:42.060" style="s2">I got to them at a stage in my career where I was already</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.490" end="00:06:47.190" style="s2">advanced and I was already a headliner and I&#39;ve been doing stand-up comedy for decades</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:51.860" style="s2">So it was it was good in that sense that I was well prepared</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:53.460" style="s2">but they you know they</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.600" end="00:07:00.280" style="s2">when we first signed this initial deal, they were really just wanting me to do what I do best</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.460" end="00:07:00.980" style="s2">Right</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.980" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">So they liked it and it&#39;s easy. There&#39;s no, there is really</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.780" end="00:07:07.100" style="s2">relatively little input, almost none</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.100" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">Right, so they&#39;re not willing to mess with success fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.640" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">Yeah, they like what I do. So they&#39;re just like &#39;go ahead&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.220" end="00:07:17.040" style="s2">they know that my goal is to do my best</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.080" end="00:07:20.620" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to, I mean, there are comedians that will release</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.130" end="00:07:22.440" style="s2">material just for the money</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.440" end="00:07:27.209" style="s2">they&#39;ll try to capitalize on their fame and put something out but sloppy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.550" end="00:07:33.690" style="s2">I feel like, for me at least, that&#39;s that&#39;s not an option and that would taint my legacy and taint my</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.120" end="00:07:37.660" style="s2">my body of work. I&#39;m not interested in doing that.</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.660" end="00:07:41.300" style="s2">Right, right. Yeah well, I&#39;ve seen your Netflix specials and they&#39;re pretty damn funny</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.860" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">Thank you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:45.940" style="s2">and that that&#39;s that that that ver- that, uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.320" end="00:07:48.680" style="s2">little skit you did on the Kardashians</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.480" end="00:07:50.940" style="s2">that was a killer, man</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.940" end="00:07:53.040" style="s2">Thank you. That took forever to work out</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.040" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">I bet</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:55.660" style="s2">to figure out a way to make fun of that guy</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">or girl</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.000" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">Oh God, it was it was ridiculous. You make an extremely intense,</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.380" end="00:08:04.120" style="s2">demonic, gargoyle</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.120" end="00:08:06.180" style="s2">You&#39;ve very good sense of humor</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.180" end="00:08:07.060" style="s2">you know, so that was killing me</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.060" end="00:08:09.600" style="s2">I thought, Jesus he&#39;s not going to go there is he?</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.780" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">Oh, yeah, yeah, he is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.220" end="00:08:12.620" style="s2">Oh he&#39;s going to go for it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.840" end="00:08:14.100" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.110" end="00:08:18.480" style="s2">It&#39;s good to see that kind of like horrific courage manifest itself on stage</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.820" end="00:08:20.879" style="s2">You really like that in a comedian, you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.880" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">And you see them get going and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.540" end="00:08:26.760" style="s2">I used to see this with Sarah Silverman. You could see her eyes sort of flash and she&#39;d think,</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.000" end="00:08:29.260" style="s2">Oh I shouldn&#39;t say that. Nah, there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.480" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">Then she&#39;d say it, and you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:32.500" style="s2">Yup</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.500" end="00:08:35.400" style="s2">oh, no one should have said that but man, it was deadly</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.920" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">Yeah, I think out of all the women doing comedy right now, she&#39;s probably the best at that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.400" end="00:08:40.920" style="s2">You know?</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.960" end="00:08:41.640" style="s2">She can come up with some-</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:43.080" style="s2">She&#39;s the best at pushing that envelope</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.260" end="00:08:47.640" style="s2">Yeah that&#39;s, that&#39;s for sure. She&#39;s got, there&#39;s some very dark recesses in that woman&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:50.600" style="s2">Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.600" end="00:08:52.600" style="s2">Okay so the Netflix thing is going well</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.620" end="00:08:55.540" style="s2">do you, do you enjoy, do you enjoy doing that?</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.540" end="00:08:57.740" style="s2">Yes. Yeah, I enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:08:59.880" style="s2">What do you like about it?</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.880" end="00:09:04.900" style="s2">The danger of it, the the difficulty, the challenge that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.960" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">one, it&#39;s done and people enjoy it that I&#39;m legitimately affecting people. I love, I love that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.960" end="00:09:16.540" style="s2">when people though get a chance to sit down and watch it for an hour and it&#39;ll make them feel better</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.540" end="00:09:20.620" style="s2">They&#39;ll laugh, they they, it takes them out of the dreary,</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.590" end="00:09:25.179" style="s2">dullness of their day, or the agony of whatever they&#39;re going through in their life</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.180" end="00:09:27.260" style="s2">And they can escape that for an hour, and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.260" end="00:09:29.020" style="s2">Yeah, thank God for comedy, man</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.020" end="00:09:33.720" style="s2">It&#39;s just abo-, it&#39;s just in the same domain as music for necessity.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.720" end="00:09:36.320" style="s2">Yeah, I agree. It&#39;s, it affects people</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:40.820" style="s2">You know there are campus now, where there&#39;s like, no sarcasm rule, say</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.820" end="00:09:42.860" style="s2">Oh, that&#39;s hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.860" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">God, could you imagine?</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:46.020" style="s2">Id, I&#39;d last like 50 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:50.540" style="s2">It&#39;s like, yeah, is sarcasm considered a micro-aggression? Is that what it is?</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.540" end="00:09:52.540" style="s2">Yes, definitely. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.540" end="00:09:54.100" style="s2">Unless it&#39;s real sarcasm,</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.100" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">in which case it&#39;s a macro-aggression</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.860" end="00:10:02.460" style="s2">I just keep thinking that in time, this is going to be one of the most hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:06.920" style="s2">uh, periods of time that people look back on, periods of history</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.940" end="00:10:12.180" style="s2">like, you know, when we look at guys with powdered wigs, and you know, preposterous behavior from the past</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.180" end="00:10:14.120" style="s2">and we go, God what were they thinking?</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.400" end="00:10:17.400" style="s2">I really think we&#39;re going to do the same thing about today. I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">Well I hope so.</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.280" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">One of the most-, I think for sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:21.420" style="s2">I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.420" end="00:10:23.880" style="s2">That means that will be more sane when we&#39;re looking back</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.880" end="00:10:24.820" style="s2">or at least we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.820" end="00:10:29.700" style="s2">insane in a different way, and I&#39;m pretty much ready for a different form of insane personally</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.280" end="00:10:33.300" style="s2">well, I think the insane that you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:35.260" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.260" end="00:10:38.900" style="s2">It&#39;s so pronounced and it&#39;s so much more intense that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.740" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">it has</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.250" end="00:10:41.660" style="s2">It&#39;s less effective</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.660" end="00:10:44.169" style="s2">and then the reaction to it, it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.660" end="00:10:50.589" style="s2">more popular, the negative reaction, to a lot of this insane rhetoric and it&#39;s insane behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">It&#39;s more popular now</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:55.960" style="s2">to understand how ridiculous some of these people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.200" end="00:10:59.860" style="s2">You know, when you see like what antifa is doing in Portland</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.230" end="00:11:07.630" style="s2">blocking traffic and you know the telling people where to go what to do and beating people up that don&#39;t comply and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:14.620" style="s2">Saying that you&#39;re a white supremacist, if you don&#39;t listen to them and like this this all this stuff is so ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.620" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">It&#39;s so over the top and they keep feeding on themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.980" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">they keep attacking people that are not progressive enough, they keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.580" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">literally eating their own, and it it, for the, from the outside, from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.960" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">perspective of people that don&#39;t share their ideology</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.100" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">It looks more and more ridiculous and that makes them more and more</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:41.020" style="s2">frenzied, and it ramps it all up, and I think it&#39;s ultimately going to crash</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.500" end="00:11:46.620" style="s2">It&#39;s just like, what kind of damage is it gonna do the landscape as it&#39;s crashing?</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.620" end="00:11:47.520" style="s2">Right, right</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.520" end="00:11:52.300" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing that you know, hopefully can be mitigated so that the landing isn&#39;t too hard</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.630" end="00:11:53.130" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.130" end="00:11:57.089" style="s2">So I thought, look, every time we&#39;ve talked we&#39;ve talked a lot about me and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:03.990" style="s2">Like I&#39;m quite sick of talking about me actually and probably have been for like a year or maybe even longer</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.300" end="00:12:07.820" style="s2">so I thought that it would be really good to talk about you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.900" end="00:12:11.140" style="s2">I&#39;m curious about you because you&#39;re such a strange character. And so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.620" end="00:12:12.120" style="s2">Um</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.220" end="00:12:15.180" style="s2">You know, in the in the most interesting of ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.260" end="00:12:20.280" style="s2">and so I thought I&#39;d like start at the beginning. So, I don&#39;t know that much about you. So, um</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.540" end="00:12:23.540" style="s2">Where&#39;d you grow up?</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.590" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">Well, I grew up in a lot of places. I was born in New Jersey, um, I lived there until I was seven. My mother</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.510" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">split up from my dad and married my stepdad</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:37.150" style="s2">We moved to California</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.150" end="00:12:40.410" style="s2">with lived in San Francisco from age 7 to 11</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:45.060" style="s2">Then I lived in Florida. He was going to the University of Florida at Gainesville</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.180" end="00:12:54.580" style="s2">lived there from age 11 to right around 13, then we moved to Boston and I lived in Boston for</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.720" end="00:12:57.580" style="s2">The next</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.580" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">I guess the next 10 years, and that&#39;s really where I grew up, I grew up basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:07.480" style="s2">when I when I think of where I come from, I think of Boston. It&#39;s also the place where I started doing stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.480" end="00:13:10.080" style="s2">which means a lot to me. It&#39;s also where I started fighting</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:11.820" style="s2">It&#39;s where I started doing martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.820" end="00:13:15.700" style="s2">All the significant things that happened in my life happened in Boston</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.700" end="00:13:17.080" style="s2">in my developmental period</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.160" end="00:13:19.720" style="s2">and so you moved to Boston, when you were how old?</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.340" end="00:13:21.260" style="s2">13</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:23.480" style="s2">13, I see. Yeah. Right, right.</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.480" end="00:13:25.480" style="s2">And then you were there for how many years?</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.660" end="00:13:27.180" style="s2">11, 11 years.</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.180" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">Oh, yeah, so that&#39;s a long time. Yeah, where&#39;d you live in Boston?</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.960" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">Newton. Newton upper falls, it&#39;s a suburb of Boston</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.600" end="00:13:37.280" style="s2">Yeah. Yeah, nice and New England ay</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.660" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">Yeah, I love it out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:40.460" style="s2">Yeah, me too</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.700" end="00:13:42.380" style="s2">The people have a great sense of humor</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.380" end="00:13:42.939" style="s2">it&#39;s, ah</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.940" end="00:13:50.020" style="s2">like Toronto in a way, that you have to deal with that wicked winter and I think that develops character in people, I think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.040" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">Well it&#39;s funny, you know when I moved to Boston</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.100" end="00:13:56.840" style="s2">cos I well I lived in Alberta in Montreal and Montreal is</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:00.239" style="s2">bloody horrible in the winter and Alberta is even worse</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:03.180" style="s2">and so I was I&#39;d go down to Boston and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.670" end="00:14:08.490" style="s2">I went down there to interview first, and it was February and like, it was spring as far as I was concerned</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.490" end="00:14:11.849" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even have a coat on and then when we lived there for years, you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.850" end="00:14:16.019" style="s2">it was so funny we lived in this old house by a park and we&#39;d get those Nor&#39;easters blow in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.149" end="00:14:17.439" style="s2">you know with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.439" end="00:14:20.609" style="s2">hurricane level winds and it bloody well snow three and a half feet and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.740" end="00:14:24.930" style="s2">I&#39;d be thinking in my Canadian way that Jesus I better not go outside because I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.149" end="00:14:28.529" style="s2">freeze to death the second I step outside but I&#39;d go outside it was like</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.009" end="00:14:37.229" style="s2">Well, I was 34 degrees or some damn thing. It&#39;s like I was expecting minus 40, you know, just horrible</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.290" end="00:14:44.819" style="s2">So my Boston winters never, I mean apart from the snow which was you know deadly significant. They never really struck me as winter</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.820" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">They sort of struck me as,</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:49.160" style="s2">well this is the sort of winter that you&#39;d like to have if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.420" end="00:14:53.900" style="s2">like a showy winter that people could be pleased with, rather than one you&#39;d just sort of killed you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.580" end="00:14:55.420" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.420" end="00:14:57.980" style="s2">Yeah, Canadians are on another level when it comes to winter</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">I have some pretty good friends that live in Alberta. And when I whenever I go up there it&#39;s like, whoa</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:06.760" style="s2">Yeah, where do you, where do you go? Where do you go?</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.760" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">Um</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:12.620" style="s2">They&#39;re outside of Edmonton, they&#39;re about, uh, two and a half hours north of Edmonton</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.620" end="00:15:14.420" style="s2">Where?</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.420" end="00:15:18.640" style="s2">Uh, I don&#39;t know the name of their town. It&#39;s where I go bear hunting.</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.640" end="00:15:19.200" style="s2">A-ha</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.200" end="00:15:20.980" style="s2">Um, that&#39;s, uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.020" end="00:15:22.020" style="s2">Yeah, cos bear, you know, you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:25.000" style="s2">One thing you notice about bear, is they have fur</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:27.280" style="s2">See that&#39;s why they can live there</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.280" end="00:15:27.960" style="s2">Humans</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:33.180" style="s2">They don&#39;t have fur. So they can&#39;t actually live there. You have two to half hours north of Edmonton in the winter</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.180" end="00:15:34.680" style="s2">Yeah, yeah. You see you go outside</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.680" end="00:15:35.180" style="s2">It&#39;s rugged</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.380" end="00:15:38.500" style="s2">Yeah you go outside in the wrong day and you&#39;re out there too long then you die</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.000" end="00:15:39.500" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.500" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">Yeah, or you run into a grizzly, which is also</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.420" end="00:15:47.700" style="s2">That yes, there&#39;s also that those those those are those are nothing to contend</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.709" end="00:15:52.209" style="s2">Those are nothing to take lightly man. When we used to go camping especially in British Columbia</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.640" end="00:15:58.149" style="s2">grizzly bears were always a concern, because like a black bear if it chases you and first of all</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.149" end="00:16:01.929" style="s2">It&#39;s only about third the size of a grizzly bear and it&#39;s still pretty big like it&#39;s a black bear</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.930" end="00:16:06.760" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a house cat and if those things chase you and you and you play dead</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.950" end="00:16:09.489" style="s2">They&#39;ll usually leave you alone. But if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.370" end="00:16:15.760" style="s2">grizzly chases you and you play dead then it eats you and so and then of course if you fight back well</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.760" end="00:16:20.180" style="s2">it also eats you, it just, maybe you get a hit-, a blow or two in, and probably not</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:21.840" style="s2">so yeah, that was one</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.840" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">Well, the reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.500" end="00:16:23.220" style="s2">of the terrors, camping there</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.220" end="00:16:24.520" style="s2">Believe it or not, more</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.540" end="00:16:26.080" style="s2">more people are, uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.080" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">preyed upon by black bears when a black bear attacks you it&#39;s usually because it&#39;s trying to eat you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.280" end="00:16:39.760" style="s2">When a grizzly bear attacks people it&#39;s usually either mistake or it was it was scared or it&#39;s really hungry</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.460" end="00:16:44.420" style="s2">Yeah, the black bears tend to be like that too. A lot of them are old if they attack you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.420" end="00:16:45.620" style="s2">Yes, yeah, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.620" end="00:16:46.440" style="s2">They&#39;re getting, they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.440" end="00:16:53.280" style="s2">so they can&#39;t catch a real animal. So they&#39;re, they&#39;ll settle for my gun, you know as an arctic monkey with no fat</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.920" end="00:16:56.360" style="s2">Yeah, they get desperate</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.360" end="00:17:00.280" style="s2">Yeah so okay so New Jersey, what do you remember about New Jersey?</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.160" end="00:17:06.660" style="s2">Ah, boy, that&#39;s where I went to Catholic school which was a horror in and of itself, and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.420" end="00:17:14.820" style="s2">it&#39;s you know where my relatives lived and I just remember the the ethnic ethnic Italian environment and what that was like</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.820" end="00:17:21.540" style="s2">You know with what it was like being around my relatives are out there, very Sopranos-like if you&#39;ve ever watched the TV show</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.540" end="00:17:22.300" style="s2">Oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.300" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s really representative of a lot of New Jersey</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">you know, I don&#39;t remember too much other than that though</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.260" end="00:17:29.700" style="s2">you know I was pretty little when we left</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.700" end="00:17:31.720" style="s2">Do you still have relatives out there?</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.720" end="00:17:36.300" style="s2">Um, I have one uncle, well two uncles, who still live there. That&#39;s it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.300" end="00:17:37.900" style="s2">Do you ever see them?</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.940" end="00:17:39.940" style="s2">I haven&#39;t seen them in years</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.460" end="00:17:47.420" style="s2">Okay so New Jersey, mostly positive memories, do you think? Or just it&#39;s just I mean 7 and below that&#39;s pretty young. So</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.350" end="00:17:51.669" style="s2">Well it was a tumultuous time period for me and my parents</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">We were, uh, always fighting and it just wasn&#39;t a good time</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.440" end="00:17:59.420" style="s2">So when we escaped New Jersey, it was a relief</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.420" end="00:18:02.300" style="s2">And that was also when your mum split up from your dad?</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.420" end="00:18:03.220" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.220" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">And do you do do you still have, are you in contact with your dad?</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.880" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">No, I haven&#39;t spoken to him since I was 7 years old</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.720" end="00:18:13.670" style="s2">Is he still alive?</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.670" end="00:18:17.469" style="s2">He&#39;s still alive, and his name&#39;s Joe Rogan, which is even crazier</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.500" end="00:18:19.940" style="s2">Ha</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.940" end="00:18:21.940" style="s2">So you ever think about him?</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.340" end="00:18:24.180" style="s2">No, no, not really</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.180" end="00:18:26.180" style="s2">No, no, it&#39;s a long time ago. Well, that&#39;s,</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.780" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">Ha</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:29.920" style="s2">Well, and do you remember what he was like to you?</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.560" end="00:18:32.300" style="s2">He was nice to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.300" end="00:18:34.300" style="s2">He just wasn&#39;t very nice to my mother</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">They had a very bad relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.070" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.150" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:42.010" style="s2">Okay, so you leave New Jersey and you go to California</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.530" end="00:18:44.530" style="s2">Yeah, where&#39;d you live there?</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">we lived in San Francisco and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.180" end="00:18:51.300" style="s2">that was an interesting time for me because it was during the Vietnam War</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.760" end="00:18:57.180" style="s2">and it was sort of the height of the hippie movement - right - and my stepdad was a hippie</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.580" end="00:18:59.940" style="s2">My father was a police officer in New Jersey</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.520" end="00:19:01.380" style="s2">Oh, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.390" end="00:19:05.739" style="s2">So I went from being around a cop who was a pretty brutal guy</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.050" end="00:19:13.509" style="s2">To being around a long-haired hippie who was all about peace and love and was an architecture student, you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.510" end="00:19:15.510" style="s2">It was a completely different sort of vibe</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.070" end="00:19:18.669" style="s2">Yeah, sounds like a completely different sort of vibe</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.160" end="00:19:23.460" style="s2">Yeah I was around a lot of gay folks, and around a lot of hippies</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.460" end="00:19:25.500" style="s2">a lot of pot smokers</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:31.680" style="s2">a lot of real open minded thinkers and weirdos around Haight Ashbury and that that sort of area</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.680" end="00:19:33.640" style="s2">we lived near Lombard Street</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.640" end="00:19:36.120" style="s2">It was real classic San Francisco in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:42.120" style="s2">70s so yeah, so yeah, let&#39;s see so you would have been you said seven</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.120" end="00:19:43.720" style="s2">How</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.720" end="00:19:50.260" style="s2">So wouldn&#39;t like 74 70 74 because I was seven years old right more than 57</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.990" end="00:19:56.020" style="s2">Yeah, so you&#39;re five years. I see you&#39;re five years younger than me. So that yeah that places you there</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.020" end="00:20:01.239" style="s2">So yeah, it was still pretty hippie central. Yeah, it was pretty it was pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.790" end="00:20:03.770" style="s2">and then I went from there to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.770" end="00:20:10.810" style="s2">Florida which is like a total polar opposite, you know, that was the first time I&#39;d ever heard anybody say the n-word was in</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.820" end="00:20:15.139" style="s2">Florida and I didn&#39;t know what it meant. I had to ask my mother my mother got upset at me</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.169" end="00:20:20.029" style="s2">She thought I knew what it meant. I was just playing games. I don&#39;t know what it means. Like tell me what it means</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.220" end="00:20:24.169" style="s2">She said it&#39;s a bad word for black people and I was like, wow, really?</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.230" end="00:20:28.250" style="s2">Uh-huh, because I was hearing it all the time. I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:34.369" style="s2">Never heard it in San Francisco and literally didn&#39;t hear it until I was 13 years old or excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.370" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">11 years old and so yeah, so where did he move to Ville in Florida? We moved to Gainesville</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.650" end="00:20:44.959" style="s2">Which is where the University of Florida was where my stepdad was going?</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.539" end="00:20:46.740" style="s2">to get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.740" end="00:20:53.089" style="s2">He was he&#39;s studying architecture. And then we eventually moved to Boston so he could go to the Boston Architectural Center</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.130" end="00:21:00.859" style="s2">That&#39;s why we wound up moving there. And is your mom and as your mom and your stepdads still together? Yep, still together. And yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.500" end="00:21:04.760" style="s2">All the time. Yeah. They have a great relationship. It&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.280" end="00:21:13.099" style="s2">Completely different they&#39;ve been together forever. They they just they get along fantastic and in many ways that sort of modeled my</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.130" end="00:21:21.289" style="s2">expectations for a real relationship, you know, like I saw the worst and then I saw a really great one and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.289" end="00:21:23.289" style="s2">Okay, I want that, you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.580" end="00:21:29.090" style="s2">Yeah, that&#39;s a good choice. That&#39;s that shows some wisdom on your part. Pick up the second one rather than the first one</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:35.390" style="s2">Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And is that worked out? Have you had good relationships? Oh, yeah. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.390" end="00:21:37.340" style="s2">I mean my wife&#39;s awesome again</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.340" end="00:21:42.949" style="s2">You&#39;d be married for how long almost ten years ten years and you have two girls or three?</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.950" end="00:21:47.390" style="s2">I have three girls three girls, right young ones and one adult one</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.090" end="00:21:50.959" style="s2">Right. I remember on this special that I was referring to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:55.850" style="s2">You were bemoaning the fact that you were absolutely saturated in a feminine environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.370" end="00:22:03.169" style="s2">Yeah, yeah. It&#39;s interesting man. It&#39;s interesting. But I think it balances me out. I think ultimately it&#39;s probably good for me. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.809" end="00:22:05.809" style="s2">Ting now you wait till they hip teenagehood</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.659" end="00:22:11.149" style="s2">Yeah be interesting. All right. Yeah for sure. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:14.629" style="s2">I actually enjoyed having teenagers, you know weirdly enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.630" end="00:22:19.459" style="s2">I mean, we had a good rule in our house with our kids brought their friends over to our house a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.220" end="00:22:21.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.240" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">It was funny because when they first came over when my teenagers friends came</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.610" end="00:22:29.900" style="s2">They were always afraid of me but after gonna be in there, you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.900" end="00:22:33.319" style="s2">Like getting to know the place a bit not staying there all the time, obviously</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.390" end="00:22:37.099" style="s2">But getting a bit familiar with it, they ended up being a lot more afraid of my wife</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.580" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">Looked at dangerous on first impressions and she&#39;s kind of soft-spoken, but she&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.350" end="00:22:51.980" style="s2">Unforgiving that might be one way of putting it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.500" end="00:22:55.939" style="s2">Even we had a pretty good rule in our house with the teenage kids</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.940" end="00:23:00.500" style="s2">Which is was it&#39;s a good one to know which was look we&#39;re really happy you&#39;re here, you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.930" end="00:23:05.930" style="s2">But if you do something really stupid and we never ever have to see you again. That would actually be okay with us</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.560" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">And so the kids could have their friends over, you know naked have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:21.980" style="s2">They could have a reasonable amount of fun or maybe even a slightly unreasonable amount of fun</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.980" end="00:23:25.909" style="s2">but they couldn&#39;t have an overwhelmingly unreasonable amount of fun a</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:28.980" style="s2">Great way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.980" end="00:23:33.650" style="s2">Overwhelmingly unreasonable amount of fun is a great way to put it. Yeah. That was too much too much</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.650" end="00:23:35.650" style="s2">We had a good drug policy too. I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.930" end="00:23:40.460" style="s2">Which was that girl, I think it went well the rule was</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.210" end="00:23:46.520" style="s2">Look I know perfectly. Well you&#39;re gonna experiment they were going to are an art school</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.520" end="00:23:52.039" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s like I think I think that one of the majors part smoking and another one</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.250" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">irritation, like there was just no way they weren&#39;t going to experiment and my rule was um,</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.930" end="00:24:03.590" style="s2">I better not be able to tell because you&#39;re being too much of a fool. So if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.740" end="00:24:07.099" style="s2">You better handle it because otherwise you&#39;re pathetic</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.990" end="00:24:15.109" style="s2">That seems to be pretty good well that&#39;s you know, cuz I thought I already thought it through you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.110" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">Because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a literature on</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.870" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">Experimentation among</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:23.270" style="s2">adolescents both criminal experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.420" end="00:24:27.470" style="s2">you know delinquency minor delinquency and that sort of thing a drug use and you get</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.900" end="00:24:31.069" style="s2">Pathology at both ends the ones who are you know?</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.070" end="00:24:37.549" style="s2">Smoking party everyday and take a drugs on a regular basis their outcomes not so good the ones who have stained</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.010" end="00:24:44.869" style="s2">Completely and never experiment their outcome is also not so good. They tend to be on the dependent anxious end of the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.419" end="00:24:47.419" style="s2">and so, you know you want your kids to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.179" end="00:24:50.179" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.760" end="00:24:55.640" style="s2">Play with the rules a little bit, but then I thought well what so ok, you got to play with the rules now</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.280" end="00:25:02.089" style="s2">What are the rules about playing with the rules and one should be try not to be a bigger fool than necessary?</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.490" end="00:25:08.150" style="s2">That&#39;s a good one. So you&#39;re not compromising yourself in the present, but the biggest the biggest issue</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:10.879" style="s2">I think really and I think this is the fundamental rule for</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.640" end="00:25:15.619" style="s2">Experimentation with adolescences you don&#39;t get to screw up your future</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.590" end="00:25:18.980" style="s2">Hmm, right. Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s the killer</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.040" end="00:25:23.329" style="s2">Well, would I worry about more than anything is opioids?</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">I worry about those</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.640" end="00:25:30.709" style="s2">Because people are dying from them. Yeah, you know no one&#39;s dying from pot</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.900" end="00:25:37.609" style="s2">It&#39;s very rare that anybody is doing something so stupid that they put their life in danger from pot or mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.250" end="00:25:41.540" style="s2">I&#39;m worried about the ones that kill you, you know, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.540" end="00:25:49.249" style="s2">I worry about pills more than anything that my children might possibly face, especially when I consider the fact that these</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.370" end="00:25:53.719" style="s2">opiate manufacturers these opioid manufacturers</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.720" end="00:26:00.500" style="s2">They keep making these damn things stronger and I don&#39;t understand it&#39;s not like oxycontin wasn&#39;t strong enough as it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.570" end="00:26:05.480" style="s2">But now they have fentanyl another coming up with things are stronger than fentanyl. It&#39;s disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.630" end="00:26:05.900" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.900" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">but weird arms for you say because I mean this is something that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.929" end="00:26:14.479" style="s2">unexpected consequence of the of the illegal ization of drugs is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.730" end="00:26:22.610" style="s2">now we&#39;ve generated all these chemists who are really good at making tiny variations on every psychoactive substance known and now instead of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:24.780" style="s2">10</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.780" end="00:26:29.239" style="s2">Addictive substances, you can get yourself into serious trouble with there&#39;s 300</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:32.419" style="s2">Yeah, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a big plus</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.299" end="00:26:37.789" style="s2">No, it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s disturbing and it&#39;s disgusting and you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.790" end="00:26:43.519" style="s2">They&#39;re finally starting to bring some of these guys to justice and they&#39;re arresting some of these people and bringing them to court</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.250" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">some of these manufacturers but they&#39;ve been pushing this stuff down people&#39;s throats for years and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.309" end="00:26:57.229" style="s2">Advising doctor to subscribe them and it&#39;s a tough one man, like my when my daughter was sick</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">When she was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.450" end="00:27:02.430" style="s2">She was in extreme</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.430" end="00:27:04.669" style="s2">It&#39;s gotta be agony is the right word</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.670" end="00:27:09.589" style="s2">You know for like two years about that because she was walking around on - girl - legs</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.590" end="00:27:11.590" style="s2">you know her story a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.140" end="00:27:20.959" style="s2">The physician at SickKids which which was the person who was dealing with her arthritis would only prescribe her basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:27.079" style="s2">uh, you know Anacin, you know, minor-league over-the-counter painkillers, which was like trying to kill a</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.630" end="00:27:28.920" style="s2">grizzly bear with a flyswatter</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.920" end="00:27:35.509" style="s2">It really wasn&#39;t right the right tool for the job and we found a family doctor who had enough courage to</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.330" end="00:27:38.330" style="s2">prescribe her oxycontin</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.490" end="00:27:44.420" style="s2">That was no joke, you know because for the first couple of weeks she was on oxycontin. It was really</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:52.760" style="s2">odd and rough because it was like she was drunk and so that wasn&#39;t well that was weird socially to say the least and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.190" end="00:27:59.930" style="s2">also rather frightening but it did control her pain and we actually had the mix oxycontin with</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.330" end="00:28:04.370" style="s2">Ritalin which is a strange combination, but a good one to know about because</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.160" end="00:28:07.369" style="s2">oxycontin sedates and Ritalin stimulates</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.370" end="00:28:12.949" style="s2">but the combination of the two are synergistic so they can really control pain and so her pain was</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.260" end="00:28:15.619" style="s2">Controlled enough so that it didn&#39;t drive her insane</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.230" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">Over about a two-year period and then what she got her</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.370" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">Operations and that her had her legs fixed</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.190" end="00:28:27.560" style="s2">She went off the opiates and she went through the whole withdrawal stick</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.560" end="00:28:33.799" style="s2">You know, she had like night sweats and she had ants crawling under her skin and like it was pretty brutal</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.800" end="00:28:40.279" style="s2">Although she she stopped cold turkey and never tried them again. She hated them. She said they just made her feel dead</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:44.840" style="s2">And it&#39;s funny a lot of people, you know a lot you hear their horror stories that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.840" end="00:28:50.360" style="s2">if you try o pious once you&#39;re pretty much screwed because they&#39;re so wonderful, but lots of people don&#39;t like them, but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:54.859" style="s2">Sizable minority of people, you know who really liked them</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.860" end="00:29:00.680" style="s2">And and then there is the danger that you described of overdose and that&#39;s you know, that&#39;s that&#39;s a frightening thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.840" end="00:29:03.860" style="s2">Hopefully you&#39;re getting smart enough to stay mostly away from pills</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.440" end="00:29:09.410" style="s2">Yeah what I you know, you got to worry about the influence of their friends peer pressure</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.990" end="00:29:11.690" style="s2">Yeah, yeah, definitely</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.690" end="00:29:14.210" style="s2">well the terrible thing about teenagers, you know, is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.760" end="00:29:19.609" style="s2">Everybody always says well, why do you succumb to peer pressure when you&#39;re a teenager and the answer is well?</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.610" end="00:29:21.610" style="s2">That&#39;s why you&#39;re a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.720" end="00:29:27.829" style="s2">You know you&#39;re getting away from your family and you&#39;re even getting away from your like elementary school best friend</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:32.600" style="s2">And you&#39;re starting to join the broader social group and your job is to fit in</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:36.679" style="s2">But not to fit in so much that there&#39;s nothing left of you, you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.679" end="00:29:40.819" style="s2">But your job is to fit in to the tribe to the group but to learn them</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.950" end="00:29:44.900" style="s2">And of course the downside is well, you&#39;re susceptible to peer pressure</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.900" end="00:29:52.459" style="s2">But there&#39;s it&#39;s hard to distinguish that from actually being properly socialized. You know, the two things are very tightly aligned</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.580" end="00:29:58.100" style="s2">All right. So so you were in Florida and you learned you learn some words that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.679" end="00:30:03.229" style="s2">You didn&#39;t know and what was Florida like for you you were there only for a couple of hours</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.020" end="00:30:06.889" style="s2">Yeah, Florida is a strange place man. I still have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:13.189" style="s2">Love/hate relationship with Florida. It&#39;s the Land of the Lost. It&#39;s where people go to escape wherever they&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.580" end="00:30:19.340" style="s2">Billy Corgan, who&#39;s a Billy Corbin? Who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.150" end="00:30:26.449" style="s2">Documentary director, he directed cocaine cowboys and a bunch of other great documentaries</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.090" end="00:30:35.059" style="s2">he he lives down in Florida and every time he and I talk we just talk about how ridiculous Florida is and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.669" end="00:30:36.780" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.780" end="00:30:39.469" style="s2">This place where people go to escape</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:44.809" style="s2">They go to escape from the brutal cold of the Northeast winter or they go</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.809" end="00:30:50.779" style="s2">Oh Jesus, my song is yeah. My phone is telling me that I&#39;m running out of batteries</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.150" end="00:30:55.069" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have to switch headsets and plug this in but it&#39;d only take a second</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.100" end="00:30:58.339" style="s2">Yeah, that should be fun. But I just think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.860" end="00:31:03.020" style="s2">Florida is just like a uniquely stupid place. It&#39;s a weird place</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.020" end="00:31:07.819" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s really struck me about the United States</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.820" end="00:31:10.460" style="s2">It&#39;s really different than Canada for what that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.460" end="00:31:15.290" style="s2">It&#39;s not like Americans really care why the United States is different to Canada apart for the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.290" end="00:31:17.359" style="s2">It&#39;s like freezing cold six months of the years</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.300" end="00:31:21.709" style="s2">There&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot of the us. It&#39;s like a movie set</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.260" end="00:31:26.689" style="s2">You know so much of it is like it&#39;s manufactured to look like something else</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.390" end="00:31:29.449" style="s2">In Florida is really like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.270" end="00:31:34.699" style="s2">Yeah, and it it&#39;s it&#39;s a very strange place to visit</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.400" end="00:31:42.859" style="s2">Because everything is not in the old towns, but the beach towns are like that lot that there&#39;s so there&#39;s some genuine old, Florida</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.860" end="00:31:48.740" style="s2">But most of it is it&#39;s manufactured fate utopia for exactly the sort of people that you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.740" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">you know an</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:57.380" style="s2">Unbearable or anything? I mean the weather&#39;s nice and the beach is nice and you know, there&#39;s worse places to live but</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.020" end="00:32:00.020" style="s2">There&#39;s something about it. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.330" end="00:32:02.419" style="s2">Like a part of it. It&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.720" end="00:32:09.980" style="s2">Aha, that&#39;s a reef. It&#39;s not just well, obviously, it&#39;s like a resort but resorts have that sort of fake</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.280" end="00:32:13.280" style="s2">utopian element to them that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.169" end="00:32:24.079" style="s2">What it&#39;s like exactly kind of like a child fantasy or an adolescent fantasy something like that, you know, it&#39;s what you things want</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.140" end="00:32:31.249" style="s2">If you don&#39;t yeah, I I always say that if you want to starve to death open up a bookstore in Miami</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.950" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2">haha</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.820" end="00:32:40.070" style="s2">Right like legitimately, this is no reading going on down there</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.220" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just a strange place where people go to party and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.909" end="00:32:47.689" style="s2">This is this it&#39;s weird right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.690" end="00:32:52.760" style="s2">I have to warn you that there is a beam of light shooting directly out of your head. No right here</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.850" end="00:32:58.039" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s very impressive and I move this around. There we go. Yeah, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.450" end="00:33:01.620" style="s2">Plugin</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.620" end="00:33:07.159" style="s2">Because the power was dying on my phone. I guess this video stuff sucks a lot of power</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.159" end="00:33:10.039" style="s2">I guess I guess so I guess so. I mean I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.280" end="00:33:16.579" style="s2">The light thing shooting out of your head, but you never know. You don&#39;t want to get any rumors on the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.530" end="00:33:21.030" style="s2">Well, yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.030" end="00:33:24.349" style="s2">Amongst all people know how easy that is. Hey</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.140" end="00:33:31.999" style="s2">Hey, I haven&#39;t been in this scandal for a hold a whole week. Well this podcast is still young. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">Something that will cause trouble</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.390" end="00:33:37.920" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.920" end="00:33:40.940" style="s2">all the people that I&#39;m friends with you are probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.640" end="00:33:43.640" style="s2">misrepresented friend that I have and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.550" end="00:33:46.550" style="s2">defend you quite often and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.130" end="00:33:49.939" style="s2">Don&#39;t get where people are coming from with you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.940" end="00:33:56.120" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand their inability to listen to your words and instead they try to generalize and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.580" end="00:33:58.580" style="s2">formulate these distorted</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.280" end="00:34:04.819" style="s2">Distorted descriptions of who you are and what you stand for and it&#39;s very strange to me and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.820" end="00:34:10.249" style="s2">I mean I kind of do know that you&#39;re challenging a lot of people&#39;s beliefs and the way they</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.920" end="00:34:17.960" style="s2">You know, they&#39;ve structured these beliefs, but it&#39;s very frustrating to me and I&#39;m sure it must be way more frustrating for you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.180" end="00:34:25.039" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s surreal to me because I was talking with my kids about this the other day</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.740" end="00:34:26.880" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.880" end="00:34:31.339" style="s2">The way people think I am especially if they read you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.340" end="00:34:36.559" style="s2">The hip pieces that the journalists have written and maybe even watch me in those interactions, you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:42.200" style="s2">they think I&#39;m provocative and they think I like combat and conflict and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.780" end="00:34:47.269" style="s2">I don&#39;t I&#39;m not combat at sea and I really don&#39;t like conflict that much</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:50.690" style="s2">I go out of my way quite a bit to avoid it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.360" end="00:34:53.250" style="s2">you know, I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.250" end="00:34:58.190" style="s2">misogynist except that almost to be all the people I&#39;ve ever worked with in my whole life have been women and I&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.190" end="00:35:00.190" style="s2">women dominated field and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.600" end="00:35:01.830" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.830" end="00:35:03.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.000" end="00:35:06.860" style="s2">I never thought of myself as right-wing that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.860" end="00:35:11.660" style="s2">I mean, I mean maybe now that the far-left is gone completely off the deep end</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.660" end="00:35:18.859" style="s2">It&#39;s like well, maybe I&#39;d be classified as a conservative, but that&#39;s mostly because as a social scientist</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.860" end="00:35:23.329" style="s2">I learned that you shouldn&#39;t conduct large-scale experiments on huge swathes of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.610" end="00:35:27.860" style="s2">Population and assume that your stupid idea is going to work out correctly because it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.440" end="00:35:32.569" style="s2">You can&#39;t even get people to behave properly in the lab for like half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.700" end="00:35:36.470" style="s2">So how you think you&#39;re gonna get a whole society to do what you want?</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.470" end="00:35:43.039" style="s2">You know as a consequence of passing a piece of legislation is beyond me. But yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s and here&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:45.979" style="s2">That&#39;s weird. You know like if you read the newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">when this this new you knew I got</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.380" end="00:35:56.690" style="s2">Disinvited from Cambridge Cambridge Divinity School every what what a thing to be disinvited from a Divinity School its Christ</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.690" end="00:36:00.290" style="s2">you have to be Satan himself to get disinvited from a Divinity School and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.339" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s so much crazy, you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:12.108" style="s2">And I just wanted to go down there and learn some more about the biblical stories the exodus stories. That was the idea and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.140" end="00:36:17.089" style="s2">Then to get disinvited to have that be a whole big scandal. It was just like</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.210" end="00:36:20.210" style="s2">what the hell man, it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:23.010" style="s2">It&#39;s quite the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.010" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">Situation and then so you read about all this and and you see this online and you think God his life must just be hell</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.660" end="00:36:37.549" style="s2">because of all the controversy but then when I go out in the streets or to my lectures or anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.549" end="00:36:39.549" style="s2">It&#39;s completely different. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.930" end="00:36:43.430" style="s2">Unbelievably different like so now if I walked it walk down the street</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.430" end="00:36:46.760" style="s2">I mean when you walk down this street, you must just get I mean you just must get</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.880" end="00:36:49.880" style="s2">identified all the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.250" end="00:36:54.439" style="s2">But yeah, if you go out in an hour how many people will come up to you?</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.380" end="00:36:57.210" style="s2">Depends where I go</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.210" end="00:37:00.139" style="s2">But if I&#39;m in Hollywood, it&#39;s pretty pretty crazy</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.210" end="00:37:07.040" style="s2">If I go around young people if you see men and their shaved heads and tattoos it gets nuts</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.339" end="00:37:10.339" style="s2">my people</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.140" end="00:37:22.250" style="s2">Walking down the street and it doesn&#39;t really matter where usually I get approached five or six times in an hour by people and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.410" end="00:37:25.910" style="s2">you know, they&#39;re always very polite and they&#39;re very apologetic and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.430" end="00:37:33.859" style="s2">They they are happy about something they&#39;ve read or listened to or whatever are often. They talk about our podcast</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.859" end="00:37:37.848" style="s2">That&#39;s pretty damn common. That was common throughout Europe as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.849" end="00:37:39.140" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.140" end="00:37:44.599" style="s2">They tell me about some dark part of their life and how they&#39;re doing much better and you know how their friends have been watching</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.599" end="00:37:46.729" style="s2">My videos and feeling better about it. So it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.700" end="00:37:52.700" style="s2">ridiculously positive just all the time and then when I go to my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.430" end="00:37:58.520" style="s2">It&#39;s the same thing. It&#39;s like yeah crazily positive. So, you know we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.790" end="00:38:04.109" style="s2">303 mm people at the lectures so far and there hasn&#39;t been one</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.260" end="00:38:06.460" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.460" end="00:38:09.329" style="s2">Occurrence we had one heckler once who was rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.400" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">escorted from the building and he knew he was going to get as scored and so he was kind of a cooperative heckler, but</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.559" end="00:38:16.559" style="s2">Like no one&#39;s coming there with</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:17.980" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.980" end="00:38:21.000" style="s2">thing negative on their mind they&#39;re there to listen to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.190" end="00:38:27.059" style="s2">psychological lecture to have a deep discussion and to try to get their act together and the goddamn journalists</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.059" end="00:38:34.109" style="s2">They just don&#39;t seem to be able to fathom that like they&#39;ve got this false cynicism or maybe real cynicism that makes it absolutely impossible</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.299" end="00:38:36.299" style="s2">for them to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.549" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">you know tens of thousands of people could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.150" end="00:38:44.369" style="s2">Serious about improving their life and that I could be having events that were</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.309" end="00:38:46.750" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.750" end="00:38:51.149" style="s2">100% positive and so online I&#39;m a bloody monster, you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.150" end="00:38:55.109" style="s2">I&#39;m a misogynistic racist and the transfer but not what else am I?</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.630" end="00:39:02.069" style="s2">I&#39;m a homophobe and uh Oh a Nazi lots of times and sometimes it&#39;s you is shell and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.640" end="00:39:07.500" style="s2">Well, there&#39;s a bunch of other things to only disturb me</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.200" end="00:39:11.789" style="s2">Excuse me would serve me about you is when they pulled your books out of New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.130" end="00:39:16.950" style="s2">When a New Zealand bookstore decided to pull your books because of the Christchurch massacre</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.950" end="00:39:20.369" style="s2">like what does a book on self-improvement and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.920" end="00:39:22.420" style="s2">taking responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.420" end="00:39:27.750" style="s2">What does that have to do with a horrific mass. Murder? I mean this the idea that they can</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.359" end="00:39:35.758" style="s2">Connected those two together and that they decided that in some way or shape your words of encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.220" end="00:39:44.069" style="s2">And recognizing the importance of discipline and of taking responsibility and self-reliance that those things your your book</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.559" end="00:39:50.219" style="s2">Somehow or another had something to do with someone doing something as awful as what happened in Christchurch</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.220" end="00:39:53.429" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s so distorted and that&#39;s like the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:58.649" style="s2">Example that I cite when I say like think about the fact that this guy&#39;s book was removed</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.109" end="00:40:06.899" style="s2">And right after something had taken place that had it literally nothing to do with anything you&#39;ve ever said ever</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.259" end="00:40:09.970" style="s2">Yeah, well</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.970" end="00:40:17.250" style="s2">They kind of got their comeuppance in some ways because people started to point that they were still carrying mine counts so doctor</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.250" end="00:40:20.399" style="s2">don&#39;t you know and then they were also carrying a book that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.100" end="00:40:24.569" style="s2">Showed you how to turn a semi-automatic into a fully automatic</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.270" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">and so, you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:32.519" style="s2">You got to be careful when you go after someone for their sins that you don&#39;t have a few sins of your own like gliding</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.520" end="00:40:39.600" style="s2">Around where people can you know sort of observe them. Anyways, they reverse that decision, but but Tom&#39;s good. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.600" end="00:40:42.419" style="s2">Yeah, that was good, but it&#39;s very weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.080" end="00:40:46.620" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to the UK here right away</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.740" end="00:40:52.350" style="s2">Now we&#39;re talking about me and we weren&#39;t supposed to be but I&#39;m going to the UK right away cuz the paperback is launching there</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.350" end="00:40:58.110" style="s2">And so I&#39;m gonna be talking to journalists and talking to UK journalists, man. That&#39;s like jumping into a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.960" end="00:41:02.429" style="s2">tub of well, not full-grown crocodiles, but you know like</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.490" end="00:41:04.870" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.870" end="00:41:07.109" style="s2">Hey, so what you&#39;re trying to say is?</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.080" end="00:41:09.910" style="s2">Yeah, they&#39;re pretty snappy</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.910" end="00:41:11.350" style="s2">Soon. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.350" end="00:41:16.019" style="s2">I&#39;ve got some trepidation about that. But so it&#39;s a funny. It&#39;s a funny life, too</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.260" end="00:41:22.320" style="s2">It&#39;s a very peculiar life to be involved in and I&#39;m not exactly ever sure what to make of it on a day-to-day basis</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.320" end="00:41:24.330" style="s2">But it does give ones most peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.490" end="00:41:31.169" style="s2">so that&#39;s what&#39;s most peculiar for you is that you were not famous for most of your adult life and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.270" end="00:41:35.189" style="s2">then over the last four years you&#39;ve been catapulted and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.740" end="00:41:38.429" style="s2">Become one of the most famous if not the most famous</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.980" end="00:41:45.540" style="s2">Psychologists on the planet Earth. Yes. It&#39;s very disconcerting. It&#39;s hard to get it. It&#39;s actually rather hard to adjust to that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.720" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">I mean, maybe it&#39;s a function of age</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:50.040" style="s2">I found you know when when I was younger</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.040" end="00:41:52.439" style="s2">And I used to move from place to place</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.690" end="00:41:56.639" style="s2">Take me about a year to adapt a but I also noticed that as I got older</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.370" end="00:42:03.779" style="s2">Every time I moved it took me longer to adapt by the time you&#39;re 56, you know, if you know someone for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.880" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">It&#39;s like you feel like you just started to get to know them a bit, you know when you&#39;re 17</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:12.120" style="s2">You have a roommate for six months. It&#39;s like your best friends for the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.670" end="00:42:16.590" style="s2">so great is a very difficult thing to adapt to I I can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.140" end="00:42:18.310" style="s2">can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.310" end="00:42:24.299" style="s2">Can&#39;t really wrap my mind around and then it I guess it&#39;s also partly because it&#39;s true no matter where I go</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.300" end="00:42:27.239" style="s2">like I went to Slovenia, you know, and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.170" end="00:42:34.159" style="s2">Everybody speaks English in Slovenia, by the way, and you are a big hit in Slovenia. I don&#39;t know if you know this, but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.740" end="00:42:40.790" style="s2">It looks to me like the podcast YouTube world has even more impact in places</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.950" end="00:42:43.429" style="s2">Where the press is not very reliable</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.510" end="00:42:50.390" style="s2">Like everybody you about are everybody knew about our interviews in our podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.390" end="00:42:54.859" style="s2">and so we stopped in Slovenia constantly, which is that was a real shock to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.500" end="00:42:56.690" style="s2">so buddy video</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.690" end="00:43:01.580" style="s2">so the shock is and this is the weird thing about YouTube and about podcasts is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.890" end="00:43:06.890" style="s2">It&#39;s just not one time three or two countries. It&#39;s like every damn country. And so</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.530" end="00:43:08.820" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.820" end="00:43:14.929" style="s2">but I&#39;m really fortunate really fortunate because like I said all the public encounters I have are are</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.410" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">Extremely positive. They&#39;re hard to cope with though</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:24.679" style="s2">You know in some sense because people are always they always tell me a serious story. You know, they say I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.500" end="00:43:30.919" style="s2">Was in some sort of Hell of some sort six months ago too much drugs or alcohol or a bad relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.110" end="00:43:36.979" style="s2">Or not getting along with my family or underemployed or nihilistic or depressed whatever, you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.980" end="00:43:42.020" style="s2">Like whatever little corner of hell they have to occupy and they&#39;ve been practicing</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.750" end="00:43:48.229" style="s2">Something like maybe developing a vision for their life or trying to live a more meaningful life or taking more responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.450" end="00:43:51.770" style="s2">Or like really making an effort to pull their families together</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.470" end="00:43:57.080" style="s2">and to end to advance at work regardless of what their job is and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.480" end="00:44:05.179" style="s2">It&#39;s working and so they&#39;re always like shell-shocked that is working and thrilled to death, but it&#39;s so strange to have these intense</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.080" end="00:44:13.009" style="s2">20-second 30-second conversations with people about really deep elements of their life and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.380" end="00:44:19.429" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a shock and then you walked along the street and it&#39;s a normal day and then someone else comes up and does the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.430" end="00:44:23.570" style="s2">Same thing. It&#39;s like I don&#39;t know what to do with it emotionally. It&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.120" end="00:44:28.099" style="s2">Cuz maybe you know, someone might tell you that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.100" end="00:44:29.270" style="s2">Maybe they tell you that something</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.270" end="00:44:35.120" style="s2">if you do be helping that, maybe they tell you that once a year once every five years or something, but</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.700" end="00:44:38.929" style="s2">To have it happen. All the time is I don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.930" end="00:44:44.270" style="s2">I think it fills me with kind Saro like I&#39;m really happy that it&#39;s happening and everything but</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.790" end="00:44:47.719" style="s2">There&#39;s still something about it. That&#39;s deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.450" end="00:44:50.450" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.850" end="00:44:53.539" style="s2">deeply moving and difficult to adjust to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.060" end="00:44:55.170" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.170" end="00:45:00.289" style="s2">This is ro because so many people are struggling out there and that you&#39;re again</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.750" end="00:45:04.850" style="s2">well, the sorrow is that there&#39;s so many people struggling out there and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.180" end="00:45:13.309" style="s2">They don&#39;t have this sort of they they have so little support that my lectures and podcasts in the book were</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:20.419" style="s2">What was necessary to help them straighten themselves out? It&#39;s like, you know, you just can&#39;t imagine how many people out there?</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.000" end="00:45:23.000" style="s2">Haven&#39;t heard an encouraging word</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.490" end="00:45:26.930" style="s2">Yeah, their home on what&#39;s the old song and home on the range?</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.720" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">Yeah, that&#39;s where you don&#39;t hear a discouraging word. Well, these people have never heard an encouraging word</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.730" end="00:45:37.310" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s sad to see how calm and that is and how little</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.950" end="00:45:44.569" style="s2">it takes to return that around and it&#39;s so fun out there in the lectures because you know a lot of the people in my</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.570" end="00:45:50.029" style="s2">Lectures are correct, you know the same people you were talking about that stopped you at Hollywood, you know, they&#39;re kind of rough</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.670" end="00:45:56.509" style="s2">Working-class guys, that&#39;d be about 30% of my audience. I would think you know, and they&#39;re not the sort of people that you would</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.480" end="00:46:01.130" style="s2">Stereotypically presume would come to an hour-and-a-half lecture on you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.650" end="00:46:06.589" style="s2">Philosophy and psychology, but man, they&#39;re listening. They&#39;re listening like mad and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.410" end="00:46:09.469" style="s2">Fun and interesting to watch them</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.660" end="00:46:15.499" style="s2">think it through and to and to take this seriously and you know and they come up afterwards and they say, you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.500" end="00:46:17.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve been watching your lectures and I&#39;m a much better husband</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.900" end="00:46:23.749" style="s2">or I&#39;m a much better father and sometimes they have their girlfriend or wife with them and she says the same thing and you know,</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.690" end="00:46:26.690" style="s2">It&#39;s really nice, man</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.180" end="00:46:28.590" style="s2">Trudy said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.590" end="00:46:34.340" style="s2">Well, you really are making a giant impact and it&#39;s only understandable that it would be difficult for you to wrap your head around</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:40.850" style="s2">What this is and it&#39;s it&#39;s not something that very few human beings ever get to experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.980" end="00:46:44.719" style="s2">It&#39;s a very very very tiny percentage of our population</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.830" end="00:46:53.029" style="s2">Worldwide has ever put into position like you&#39;re put into so I will see let&#39;s look at your position</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.370" end="00:46:54.600" style="s2">I asked you this one time</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.600" end="00:46:59.490" style="s2">So you you last time we talked? I think you were getting something to prop</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.830" end="00:47:05.789" style="s2">Hundred million downloads a month on your podcast. What are your fingers if you didn&#39;t if you don&#39;t mind?</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.910" end="00:47:08.680" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.680" end="00:47:10.530" style="s2">double bad jay-z Christ</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.530" end="00:47:15.330" style="s2">That&#39;s just unblessed with YouTube with the YouTube and all the YouTube clips</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.330" end="00:47:21.600" style="s2">And it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s actually probably more than that. It&#39;s nuts. I it&#39;s gotten to the point where I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:28.470" style="s2">try to pay as little attention to the numbers as possible and just concentrate on doing the show because</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.140" end="00:47:31.410" style="s2">I think if I pay attention to it too much. I</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.680" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">Think I might pay attention to too much. Am I losing my mind? I mean, it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.240" end="00:47:45.029" style="s2">untenable, it&#39;s just the sheer volume of human beings when you if you if you were ever on a stage and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.030" end="00:47:48.450" style="s2">You were looking out at 300 million people. What would that look like?</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.900" end="00:47:53.490" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s not 300 million people because it&#39;s 300 million downloads in a month</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.490" end="00:48:00.659" style="s2">But the real number of human beings you&#39;re interacting with I mean, I don&#39;t know what that is. It&#39;s 50 million people</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.660" end="00:48:06.539" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how many actual million people are listening to the show or watching the show on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.670" end="00:48:14.639" style="s2">But it&#39;s an unmanageable number in terms of like reading comments or trying to pay attention to what they want or what they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.250" end="00:48:17.340" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.070" end="00:48:24.269" style="s2">Yes, it&#39;s a very weird. It&#39;s very weird position to be in there&#39;s no doubt and the strange thing is too. Is that well?</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.270" end="00:48:27.900" style="s2">We&#39;ve talked about this before too like this is early days, right?</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.900" end="00:48:33.569" style="s2">I mean that this has only been happening for about how long have you been doing your YouTube videos?</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.540" end="00:48:41.850" style="s2">The YouTube videos are only a few years. So I think it&#39;s only three or four years. The podcast will be 10 years in December</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.030" end="00:48:46.590" style="s2">Right. Okay. So 10 years that&#39;s starting to become a decent chunk of life</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.590" end="00:48:54.329" style="s2">But 3 or 4 years that&#39;s still new and I mean the podcast market and the YouTube market are still their brand new technologies</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:55.660" style="s2">fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.660" end="00:49:00.029" style="s2">Yeah fundamentally, and now you&#39;re seeing corporations trying to capitalize on it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.030" end="00:49:07.209" style="s2">and I&#39;m sorry to get these very bizarre offers to make my podcast exclusive on this platform or that platform and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.580" end="00:49:12.519" style="s2">You know these these companies are there throwing crazy amounts of money around that podcast</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.430" end="00:49:14.540" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.540" end="00:49:18.340" style="s2">networks hundreds of millions of dollars to buy podcast networks</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.620" end="00:49:25.029" style="s2">So it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming very very strange because what was a joke five or six years ago</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.190" end="00:49:29.140" style="s2">Literally like why are you wasting your time doing a podcast? I used to hear that all the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.510" end="00:49:35.169" style="s2">Now, it&#39;s how did you do this? How did you make this podcast so popular and you need a totally different question?</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.020" end="00:49:38.860" style="s2">yeah, what well it&#39;s so strange because</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.410" end="00:49:41.150" style="s2">so many people have</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.150" end="00:49:46.990" style="s2">Nobody realized that there is a an audience for on-demand audio and you see the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.770" end="00:49:52.630" style="s2">But not just on-demand audio but long-form conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.630" end="00:49:53.440" style="s2">Yeah, one of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:58.390" style="s2">I mean even my friend Ari is one of my best friends would always tell me you got to edit your shows</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:01.000" style="s2">Nobody wants to listen to anything. That&#39;s three hours long</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.000" end="00:50:04.330" style="s2">so I&#39;d say well then they don&#39;t have to listen and he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:08.470" style="s2">you like you&#39;re you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice and I&#39;m like, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.080" end="00:50:10.220" style="s2">why not if</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.220" end="00:50:12.970" style="s2">Someone only has an hour then listen to it for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.970" end="00:50:15.580" style="s2">Like you&#39;re not gonna I mean you might miss out some information</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:18.490" style="s2">But it&#39;s not going to change your life like do whatever you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.490" end="00:50:21.669" style="s2">but I like talking to people for long periods of time because I</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.250" end="00:50:28.600" style="s2">Think you really only get cooking after like the first half hour forty minutes. That&#39;s when you get comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.600" end="00:50:32.499" style="s2">You sort of get a into a groove of communication</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.900" end="00:50:36.910" style="s2">you know of figuring out this person&#39;s rhythm and thought processes and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.610" end="00:50:42.130" style="s2">It you you and then as you expand on these ideas and you share</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.350" end="00:50:46.479" style="s2">Information back and forth to each other after an hour an hour and a half two hours</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:52.810" style="s2">That&#39;s when things really start getting deep and oftentimes the last hour of a 3-hour podcast is the best hour. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.810" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">well, that intuition was certainly right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.790" end="00:50:59.199" style="s2">Revolutionary you never know when you come up with a revolutionary idea that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.290" end="00:51:06.489" style="s2">Means as part of my revolutionary ideas just me being stubborn just like I didn&#39;t care. I wasn&#39;t doing it for money</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.560" end="00:51:12.370" style="s2">So the only reason why I was doing it was because I enjoyed talking to people like you or many of my other guests</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.370" end="00:51:15.549" style="s2">I I want to talk to it&#39;s a very rare opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.770" end="00:51:19.330" style="s2">Where I would get a chance to sit down with someone like you with no</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.850" end="00:51:24.280" style="s2">Distraction no other people in the room, no cell phones and just talk. Yeah three hours</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.280" end="00:51:28.809" style="s2">Yeah, that&#39;s so unusual in our world and our constantly distracted world</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.810" end="00:51:33.039" style="s2">And I think I&#39;ve gotten gotten a fantastic education because of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.040" end="00:51:37.390" style="s2">I mean, it&#39;s really enlightened me on so many different subjects and expanded my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.090" end="00:51:43.660" style="s2">Of people in general and since Percy series. I mean man you&#39;re up on those</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.260" end="00:51:51.520" style="s2">Up on the conspiracy theories just to keep track of the damn things</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.950" end="00:51:56.980" style="s2">Well, you got to know what people think of you, you know, I&#39;ve been lately. I&#39;m a Zionist shill</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.980" end="00:52:03.849" style="s2">This is the route most recent one. I didn&#39;t know this design in the show. Oh, yeah yours Arnaz. Chill. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.850" end="00:52:09.339" style="s2">I&#39;m a white supremacist too. Depending on who you ask. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I&#39;ve got those two things as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.560" end="00:52:15.700" style="s2">So and that&#39;s like it&#39;s real interesting to be able to juggle both of those identities. It&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.660" end="00:52:23.829" style="s2">White supremacists the next it&#39;s sort of like yeah under fluid except on the political spectrum. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.030" end="00:52:28.629" style="s2">Why do you have to be conservative or Democrat?</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.630" end="00:52:33.220" style="s2">You know, sometimes you&#39;re one and sometimes the other depends on the day and there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.860" end="00:52:35.860" style="s2">Stand-up like all the way out to the edges</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.440" end="00:52:39.099" style="s2">You know, yeah gender fluid is my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.100" end="00:52:42.220" style="s2">that&#39;s my favorite thing that&#39;s going on right now or someone could be like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.380" end="00:52:47.349" style="s2">Woman for a few hours and then be a man for the next six, you know, I ran back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.470" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">I read although I don&#39;t know if this is true</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.660" end="00:52:55.270" style="s2">but I but I read it several places and I actually look I read that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.450" end="00:53:00.429" style="s2">Olympic Committee is gonna let trans people compete in</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.070" end="00:53:03.160" style="s2">the Olympics in the next competition</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.820" end="00:53:08.590" style="s2">I&#39;m not surprised because the Olympic the IOC</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.590" end="00:53:14.920" style="s2">The Olympic Committee is incredibly corrupt and I think what they do. First of all is disgraceful</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:19.690" style="s2">They make billions of dollars the athletes make zero. I think it&#39;s disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.850" end="00:53:26.890" style="s2">I think everything about what they do is corrupt and the idea that they&#39;re there for fair and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.710" end="00:53:33.039" style="s2">Pure competition is nonsense. They&#39;re there to make shit loads of money and that&#39;s what they&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:38.709" style="s2">And with the doing is putting on these gigantic events where they profit in its</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.260" end="00:53:43.809" style="s2">Spectacular and staggering ways and the athletes dedicate their entire life</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:48.939" style="s2">To these moments and they literally make nothing and then after that if they&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.400" end="00:53:54.010" style="s2">if they&#39;re very famous and popular they can eke out a living with</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.769" end="00:54:01.029" style="s2">endorsements, right or if you know for the rare person like Michael Phelps or someone like that who&#39;s just a true outlier they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.029" end="00:54:03.489" style="s2">Get wealthy from it, but it&#39;s very very rare</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.039" end="00:54:10.419" style="s2">most of those athletes will be in severe debt most of those athletes either have to get sponsored or</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.579" end="00:54:13.929" style="s2">They have to find someone who is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:21.010" style="s2">Share the burden and and help them achieve their goals, but without some sort of altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.970" end="00:54:27.459" style="s2">Benefactor who&#39;s got millions of dollars to pour into their camp. I mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.069" end="00:54:32.979" style="s2">It&#39;s disgusting. They&#39;re professional athletes. I mean, that&#39;s what they do with their entire life</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.980" end="00:54:35.019" style="s2">You want to win a gold medal in the Olympics in?</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:39.578" style="s2">Gymnastics, you can&#39;t have a side job. You can&#39;t be working eight hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.769" end="00:54:40.269" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.269" end="00:54:47.709" style="s2">you have to be a professional athlete and the Olympic Committee&#39;s know this and and if you&#39;ve never paid attention to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:49.609" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.609" end="00:54:52.028" style="s2">They&#39;ve let people get away with cheating</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.190" end="00:54:55.419" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a fantastic documentary out right now</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.789" end="00:55:00.609" style="s2">By Brian Fogle called Icarus and it&#39;s all about the Sochi</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.769" end="00:55:05.079" style="s2">Olympics and how Russia cheated in the Sochi Olympics and the IOC</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.500" end="00:55:07.690" style="s2">barely punished them</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.690" end="00:55:15.250" style="s2">They punished a few people and how the IOC and the world anti-doping agency all they&#39;re they have people from each</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.529" end="00:55:17.768" style="s2">Book they have from each organisation</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.769" end="00:55:24.579" style="s2">They share like they go back and forth that work for one and they work for the other and they&#39;re they&#39;re totally in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.579" end="00:55:30.818" style="s2">It&#39;s a total conflict of interest and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a dirty business. So if the tide of political</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:37.059" style="s2">Perception is that it&#39;s a good progressive thing to have transwomen</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.519" end="00:55:42.399" style="s2">Competing in the UFC or not in the you I shouldn&#39;t say the UFC that&#39;ll never happen. But transwomen</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.920" end="00:55:45.399" style="s2">competing in the Olympics and that this was</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.980" end="00:55:48.230" style="s2">Whatever he wanted they would just do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.230" end="00:55:52.939" style="s2">They would do it regardless of whether or not it&#39;s fair regardless of whether or not it made sense and they would do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.130" end="00:55:57.769" style="s2">Just to get more eyes on the show just to get more money and that&#39;s that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.769" end="00:56:02.569" style="s2">That&#39;s what they&#39;re good assassinating to see how all that plays out because it&#39;s so absurd I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.569" end="00:56:06.199" style="s2">I looked up some stats the other day because I was curious. You know, it&#39;s like, okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.200" end="00:56:13.460" style="s2">I know that all the differences between men and women are socially constructed but nonetheless, I went looked up the biological</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.069" end="00:56:17.239" style="s2">comparison of strength, you know and the typical woman has</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.789" end="00:56:24.829" style="s2">30% of the upper-body strength of the typical man and about 55% of the lower body strength now</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.829" end="00:56:28.909" style="s2">That&#39;s like that&#39;s a big difference man. That makes the average man three times as strong</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.519" end="00:56:34.519" style="s2">Not for body Jesus that gives you an advantage. That&#39;s just well, it&#39;s criminal</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.339" end="00:56:40.339" style="s2">So it well it is but the question is how much do you lose from the conversion?</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.609" end="00:56:44.808" style="s2">from estrogen you lose some but if a woman</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.940" end="00:56:50.299" style="s2">Say look if you have an athlete who&#39;s a woman who&#39;s 32 years old and it turns out that she&#39;s been taking</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:53.180" style="s2">steroids her entire adult life</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.279" end="00:57:00.379" style="s2">So she&#39;s been taking steroids for 12 years everyday and then decides to stop taking them right before the Olympics</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.539" end="00:57:03.919" style="s2">Wouldn&#39;t everybody agree that she has a massive advantage</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.380" end="00:57:11.750" style="s2">Wouldn&#39;t everybody agree that most likely her tendon strength her muscle strength or bone structure. All of that has been</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.509" end="00:57:14.749" style="s2">completely altered by taking</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.480" end="00:57:19.159" style="s2">Performance-enhancing drugs we would all agree to that. Well, guess what?</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.319" end="00:57:20.630" style="s2">That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.630" end="00:57:27.650" style="s2">If you&#39;re a man for 30 years and then you decide to transition and become a woman for - even if you&#39;re taking estrogen</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:33.139" style="s2">Even if you go through this night you understand is apart from the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.960" end="00:57:35.960" style="s2">unfairness of that, uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.450" end="00:57:39.619" style="s2">what what I struggle with understanding is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:42.420" style="s2">triumphalism of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.420" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">victors is that they enter these contests and then they win and then they</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.569" end="00:57:54.619" style="s2">Celebrate their victory as if it&#39;s our genuine victory despite the fact I&#39;m wiped out these women who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.259" end="00:57:59.059" style="s2">working mostly within the rules for like, you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.369" end="00:58:05.358" style="s2">Maybe no decades, but certainly many many years in succession and they just blow them away</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.609" end="00:58:07.349" style="s2">especially in like strength</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.349" end="00:58:14.119" style="s2">Contests and then they they actually treat that like they won and then they also claim it as a moral victory</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.580" end="00:58:20.989" style="s2">You know and for me, that&#39;s just that the only thing the only thing I see in that is a narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.990" end="00:58:26.929" style="s2">That&#39;s so deep that it&#39;s almost unfathomable. It&#39;s like how can you take pride in that sort of?</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.450" end="00:58:33.409" style="s2">Victory unless you don&#39;t see who it is that you&#39;re defeating. I don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.590" end="00:58:37.309" style="s2">well, it shows how</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.790" end="00:58:45.409" style="s2">pathological this whole thing really is when you&#39;re when you&#39;re dealing with the idea that you can turn a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.050" end="00:58:49.729" style="s2">person into someone of the opposite gender not just</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.220" end="00:58:56.990" style="s2">Recognize them as being a woman and treat them as a woman and allow them to use whatever name they would like</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.990" end="00:59:00.770" style="s2">I&#39;m all for that but it&#39;s that you are going to say no</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.770" end="00:59:07.129" style="s2">This is a woman and she should be able to compete with women including in combat sports rugby</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.130" end="00:59:13.220" style="s2">There&#39;s a male to female trans athlete and that plays rugby in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.220" end="00:59:15.260" style="s2">that&#39;s two hundred and forty pounds and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.869" end="00:59:18.858" style="s2">Just smashing women and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.050" end="00:59:25.070" style="s2">Standards that are universal in terms of like what do you have to go through in terms of your conversion therapy? And</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.290" end="00:59:30.859" style="s2">Like what what about size differences when you&#39;re dealing with a high-impact sport?</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.859" end="00:59:33.799" style="s2">No, that&#39;s a little minefield like the right</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.320" end="00:59:40.399" style="s2">Nautical end of it is well, you&#39;re the gender that you say you are and the conversion is irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.400" end="00:59:43.220" style="s2">And I don&#39;t know how that translates into the sports world</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.220" end="00:59:50.179" style="s2">But my sense is that if the same thing happens in the sports world that&#39;s happened in the political world that it will be</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.820" end="00:59:52.410" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.410" end="00:59:55.940" style="s2">Indistinguishable from win it&#39;s like well now I&#39;m a woman</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.700" end="01:00:02.149" style="s2">just like I have a guy on my podcast recently and this this came up and it was a big argument and</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.670" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">He is essentially his stance was he is all for inclusiveness and he wants</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.540" end="01:00:14.179" style="s2">He would like to move towards a world where trans athletes can</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.600" end="01:00:20.989" style="s2">and they&#39;re included and they can compete as women and I was trying to explain the the benefits of</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.020" end="01:00:26.719" style="s2">being a male the physical benefits of being a male and competing against women and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.390" end="01:00:29.090" style="s2">You know, he just didn&#39;t want to hear it</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.090" end="01:00:31.340" style="s2">It was just in denial of but it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.800" end="01:00:37.850" style="s2">It was going against these preconceived notions that he had and that this in the ideology</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.280" end="01:00:43.969" style="s2">There&#39;s a part of progressive ideology. That is you&#39;re supposed to look at a trans woman as</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.490" end="01:00:49.729" style="s2">Every bit a woman. Yeah, if they&#39;re supposed to accept the doctrine that all</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.670" end="01:00:56.809" style="s2">Differences between men and women are socially constructed which is of course an a doctrine. That&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.330" end="01:00:59.840" style="s2">think nonsense delusions nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.840" end="01:01:06.529" style="s2">It&#39;s yes and it&#39;s delusional for some even deeper reason that&#39;s even harder to fathom and I don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.630" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">Yeah, it is hard to fathom. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t understand the root of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:13.699" style="s2">I really don&#39;t I even when I talk to people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.180" end="01:01:19.669" style="s2">Subscribe to these notions. I don&#39;t understand the logic. I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.670" end="01:01:26.059" style="s2">Where&#39;s where&#39;s the breakdown in their perception of the world where they don&#39;t see and there&#39;s nothing that we got into</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.320" end="01:01:30.439" style="s2">Now saying another thing that we got into was</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.290" end="01:01:32.370" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.370" end="01:01:36.289" style="s2">Transition and then he was in for the for I keep hearing this</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.300" end="01:01:38.539" style="s2">This is something that keep hearing is driving me mad</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.030" end="01:01:46.219" style="s2">That hormone blockers that these puberty blockers are reversible. They keep saying that they like they&#39;re harmless</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.440" end="01:01:52.910" style="s2">They&#39;re reversible if the child changes their mind, they could always just get off the button. The results are reversible</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.980" end="01:01:57.469" style="s2">That&#39;s not true. You&#39;re affecting the development of a child</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.600" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">If you&#39;re using these hormone blockers</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.210" end="01:02:04.310" style="s2">You are changing the way the child is going to develop because they&#39;re not going to have testosterone</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.560" end="01:02:10.249" style="s2">Where normal boy would if they&#39;re transitioning from male to female if you&#39;re doing this to a six-year-old kid</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.380" end="01:02:13.819" style="s2">The the the notion that this is completely reversible</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.820" end="01:02:18.709" style="s2">It&#39;s completely disingenuous because that child is not going to go through the same developmental</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.170" end="01:02:25.189" style="s2">Period physically as they would if they had access to testosterone, they&#39;re just not it&#39;s just not true</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.520" end="01:02:28.669" style="s2">It&#39;s not true if you talk to medical doctors, it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.670" end="01:02:30.410" style="s2">If you talk to biologists</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.410" end="01:02:37.099" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s just not true and it&#39;s something that they use to try to justify the air quotes</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.619" end="01:02:41.689" style="s2">Harmlessness of this particular type of therapy that they&#39;re encouraging. Yeah, and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.359" end="01:02:47.959" style="s2">It&#39;s just to say that there&#39;s nothing wrong with being trans and I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong being trans</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.960" end="01:02:54.379" style="s2">but I think there is something wrong with making decisions for a child or allowing a child to make decisions that will</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.020" end="01:03:00.199" style="s2">Massively impact them for the rest of their life and to make that decision when you&#39;re six</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.210" end="01:03:06.349" style="s2">Like I could only imagine if I was a person who had gone through that and then having this conversation with my parents going</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.450" end="01:03:08.899" style="s2">Why the fuck did you let me make that decision?</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.180" end="01:03:14.270" style="s2">It&#39;s really interesting to see that play itself out in the courts in about 12 years</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">Because</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.730" end="01:03:23.959" style="s2">You don&#39;t live your games six-year-old get a tattoo</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.750" end="01:03:26.060" style="s2">Right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.060" end="01:03:34.009" style="s2">I mean and tattoos fairly reversible the whole thing about it is nonsense and it&#39;s it&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.859" end="01:03:40.279" style="s2">progressive ideology that they&#39;re subscribing to there&#39;s a doctrine like you have to there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.560" end="01:03:46.429" style="s2">Different things that you have to subscribe to if you want to accept that ideology. Yes is one of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.430" end="01:03:53.510" style="s2">This is one of them trans killers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah trans children. You can&#39;t say yeah, that is problematic</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.510" end="01:03:58.489" style="s2">You can&#39;t you&#39;re not allowed to say that you can&#39;t even entertain the notion that this could be a particularly</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.040" end="01:04:01.040" style="s2">egregious offence on</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.500" end="01:04:03.919" style="s2">A child if they decide that that was a bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.700" end="01:04:08.689" style="s2">Adapting if the primary idea is that our</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.240" end="01:04:16.429" style="s2">Society is an oppressive patriarchy and I think that&#39;s like number one idea then anything that touches on that in any way</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.740" end="01:04:22.550" style="s2">immediately becomes untouchable and so in order for the adults to make the decision</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.560" end="01:04:24.240" style="s2">Then you have to believe in</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.240" end="01:04:29.869" style="s2">authority because the adults have the authority and if you&#39;re gonna believe that the adults have the authority then you have to believe that</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.210" end="01:04:36.710" style="s2">hierarchy has some value and then that tangles you up with your insistence that you know hierarchy is definitely</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.410" end="01:04:40.580" style="s2">oppressive and and the especially the Western form of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.650" end="01:04:47.330" style="s2">And so I think that central axiom is so vital that anything that gets near it</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.330" end="01:04:55.309" style="s2">it&#39;s twisted and bent like it&#39;s too close to a gravitational field and the logic is irrelevant because that fundamental central issue has to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.700" end="01:04:58.620" style="s2">supported at all cost</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.620" end="01:05:01.729" style="s2">Well, this is one of the conundrums of our conversation one of the widow</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.730" end="01:05:08.210" style="s2">we came to this one point where I said now if a child identifies as a girl I</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.670" end="01:05:13.970" style="s2">Said why not? Just let them be a girl. Why do you have to fuck with their hormones?</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.970" end="01:05:16.879" style="s2">Why do you have to be so CH whatever?</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.490" end="01:05:23.300" style="s2">Yeah, if it&#39;s all nonsense what I mean, I this is my take on all this like be just be a girl</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.850" end="01:05:25.850" style="s2">Anything where you need?</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.010" end="01:05:33.530" style="s2">Science to consistently it. Yeah, right anything will you need medical science to consistently inject chemicals into your body?</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.530" end="01:05:35.530" style="s2">They&#39;re gonna alter your hormones</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.640" end="01:05:37.640" style="s2">irreversibly at a very young age like</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.250" end="01:05:44.840" style="s2">Why why is that natural? Why are you saying this? This is what what this person</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.630" end="01:05:51.259" style="s2">Biologically or psychologically needs are you sure you see there&#39;s something that you know things I&#39;m construct</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.260" end="01:05:54.800" style="s2">It&#39;s particularly damn weird if you insist that gender is a social construct</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.620" end="01:05:59.450" style="s2">Yes, like if it&#39;s a social construct and what the hell are the hormones for?</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.270" end="01:06:03.770" style="s2">Exactly. So that was my point. Yeah, we didn&#39;t have an answer to that. No, no</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.410" end="01:06:08.599" style="s2">That&#39;s a rough one man. That&#39;s that&#39;s okay. So we&#39;re gonna go back to Boston</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.450" end="01:06:13.669" style="s2">Okay. Okay. So you said that&#39;s really where things started for you</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.670" end="01:06:18.049" style="s2">So you moved there were thirteen and so what did you get involved in?</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.240" end="01:06:20.630" style="s2">First of all, like what kind of kid were you in school?</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.190" end="01:06:24.470" style="s2">Barely pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.470" end="01:06:28.549" style="s2">I was I if ad D is real I certainly had it</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.830" end="01:06:32.420" style="s2">And I was very very interested in what I was interested in</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.420" end="01:06:38.450" style="s2">I was very uninterested in people telling me what to do, and I essentially couldn&#39;t wait to get out of school</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.610" end="01:06:43.460" style="s2">But I would excel at things that I had interest in and B</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.250" end="01:06:47.810" style="s2">Initially was art I was I wanted to be a comic book illustrator</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.210" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">Until I really got into martial arts and martial arts became the focus of my life around 14 15 years old</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.040" end="01:06:57.040" style="s2">that&#39;s when I really</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.150" end="01:06:58.170" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.170" end="01:07:01.670" style="s2">Massively obsessed and that was really the first thing that I ever did</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.250" end="01:07:06.889" style="s2">where I I really didn&#39;t feel like a loser like I really felt like oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.890" end="01:07:12.530" style="s2">I actually have some talent there that I actually can be exceptional. There&#39;s like something is that you know grew up</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.050" end="01:07:17.449" style="s2">Constantly moving didn&#39;t really have a lot of friends. I would be new in this town</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.460" end="01:07:22.879" style="s2">I&#39;d get picked on I wasn&#39;t a big kid and there was a lot of a lot of issues with that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.339" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">Psychologically, and I didn&#39;t like being afraid of other kids. I didn&#39;t like not knowing what to do ever ran into kids</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:35.568" style="s2">They were gonna bully me and pick on me. So I learned that&#39;s an annoying thing not to do what to do about</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.420" end="01:07:38.420" style="s2">yeah, yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.569" end="01:07:46.729" style="s2">You know martial arts changed that 180 degrees and then I became someone who I would be afraid of, you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.730" end="01:07:48.859" style="s2">It&#39;d be I became the opposite of what I was</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:55.220" style="s2">So what I was was someone who was terrified of conflict didn&#39;t know what to do and what I became was, you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.680" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">Talk about no champion</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">I became a martial arts champion and I knew how to fight so hard on it</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.660" end="01:08:03.619" style="s2">So many times look so like what did you do?</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.619" end="01:08:08.389" style="s2">You just walked into a joint one day and decided that that&#39;s what you were gonna do. Like. How did it come about?</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.180" end="01:08:10.490" style="s2">It was very fortunate</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.490" end="01:08:13.849" style="s2">Well, I&#39;ve done a little bit of martial arts training at a different place</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.849" end="01:08:17.568" style="s2">and then one day I was in Boston for a</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.910" end="01:08:25.129" style="s2">Red Sox game at Fenway Park, and as I was walking home to the train station with a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.250" end="01:08:29.149" style="s2">There was a lot of people that were leaving the baseball game</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.150" end="01:08:35.089" style="s2">So the lines from the train for the T, which in Boston public transportation was very long</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.339" end="01:08:41.329" style="s2">So we decided to go check out the jaehun Kim Taekwondo Institute is right there</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.330" end="01:08:45.649" style="s2">And I&#39;ve been really into martial arts because of what I said, you know, I&#39;m at the aforementioned</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.859" end="01:08:51.948" style="s2">insecurities and so I went up the stairs and as I was walking up the stairs just</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.980" end="01:08:59.719" style="s2">Fortuitously a guy named John Lee was training and John was a national Taekwondo champion</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.239" end="01:09:03.499" style="s2">Who was in preparation for the World Cup?</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.049" end="01:09:09.349" style="s2">Which was this huge event that he was taken to the international event that he was about to travel to go to</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.130" end="01:09:16.040" style="s2">And he was in the peak of his training and so I walked up to the top of the stairs and I heard this</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.199" end="01:09:21.799" style="s2">crazy sound of this what it turned out to be this man kicking this bag and</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.529" end="01:09:29.809" style="s2">Slamming his heel into this bag and having to change snap and and rattle and the thud of his heel</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.120" end="01:09:34.879" style="s2">Slamming into this leather bag and I got up there and I watched this guy work out</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.179" end="01:09:37.309" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t believe a person could do that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.310" end="01:09:43.639" style="s2">I&#39;ve never seen anybody kicks something so hard in real life anybody that had such incredible</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:51.769" style="s2">martial arts skill like this guy did john, lee who became a mentor of mine and and and taught me quite a bit, but that</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.319" end="01:09:56.988" style="s2">Changed everything. I was there the next day. I talked to them. They gave me a brochure a pamphlet and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.510" end="01:10:01.520" style="s2">I was there the next day and I was probably there every day of my life</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.239" end="01:10:09.289" style="s2">Give or take a few days here or there if I was injured or something came up until I was 22 years old</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.020" end="01:10:15.529" style="s2">So how many hours a day were you spending there all day? I had keys pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.230" end="01:10:20.060" style="s2">They gave me keys. They wanted me. Well right away</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.190" end="01:10:24.889" style="s2">my instructor recognized that I was pretty obsessed and I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.530" end="01:10:27.210" style="s2">physically pretty talented</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.210" end="01:10:29.159" style="s2">so he</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.159" end="01:10:31.159" style="s2">Had me teaching classes</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.830" end="01:10:35.449" style="s2">Instead of paying he was like look if it&#39;s difficult for you to pay</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.580" end="01:10:39.350" style="s2">I&#39;d like to have you teach and there was some wisdom to that too</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.350" end="01:10:42.889" style="s2">Because one of the best ways for someone to get good at martial arts is actually to teach</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.469" end="01:10:50.749" style="s2">You actually refines your technique you think about it more you&#39;re exerting it to people that don&#39;t necessarily understand all the mechanics of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.909" end="01:10:54.979" style="s2">So I started teaching I would teach private lessons to beginners</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.980" end="01:10:59.179" style="s2">I would teach group classes, and then eventually I went on to teach at Boston University</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.179" end="01:11:06.079" style="s2">I taught at Boston University and when I was 19, I was teaching a credited class there, but he actually counted towards you GPA</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.540" end="01:11:11.689" style="s2">Hmm. And so I did that that was I was already US Open champion by then</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.050" end="01:11:16.699" style="s2">Did it take so you went in there when you were 13 and you were?</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.010" end="01:11:23.110" style="s2">Kid that was had moved around a bunch in car club sports. No 15 by the time I got to day school</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.110" end="01:11:27.880" style="s2">okay, and then I had my black belt by the time I was 17 and I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.180" end="01:11:34.389" style="s2">Competing in the adult division by then before I was ever 18. I was competing as an adult</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.390" end="01:11:38.890" style="s2">I mean he might even put me in when I was 16 if I don&#39;t know if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.800" end="01:11:45.519" style="s2">And then I won the state championship when I was 18, and I want it every year</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.550" end="01:11:48.550" style="s2">From then until I stopped</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.400" end="01:11:52.839" style="s2">Great, so year two pros one of four years to run at it there</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.880" end="01:11:55.359" style="s2">How long did it take before like were used?</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.490" end="01:12:01.659" style="s2">We were you still were you a thin like you were your skinny kid when you started. When did you start to bulk up?</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.660" end="01:12:03.660" style="s2">And get big when did you?</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.800" end="01:12:08.889" style="s2">Enough so that you know the problems with aggression stop, you know with other people&#39;s aggression</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.890" end="01:12:15.669" style="s2">Stop being a being a trouble for you. Well, luckily with high school kids heard about it right away</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.520" end="01:12:20.350" style="s2">You know, it was one of those things where you know, you find out that some</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.050" end="01:12:25.149" style="s2">Wanting it one of the kids you go to school with us flying all over the country kicking people in the head</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.090" end="01:12:28.690" style="s2">Right. They just avoided me Yeah, right</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.780" end="01:12:37.629" style="s2">It wasn&#39;t like, you know, I mean, I certainly never sought out trouble but people avoided me like, you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.150" end="01:12:44.620" style="s2">Junior and senior year. I had already become this weird kid that was obsessed with martial arts, you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.620" end="01:12:50.559" style="s2">And I spent you know, most of my life from the time most 15 12 21</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.320" end="01:12:56.980" style="s2">Training and competing. I probably fought over a hundred times. I traveled all over the country</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.980" end="01:12:59.589" style="s2">I fought in California I fought in Ohio</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.590" end="01:13:03.340" style="s2">I thought I thought all over the place and bring a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.770" end="01:13:09.879" style="s2">local tournaments in Connecticut in Massachusetts and New Hampshire&#39;s were won the US Open and</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.790" end="01:13:15.220" style="s2">You know just bought everywhere and that was that was mostly like my life</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.230" end="01:13:18.490" style="s2">Yeah, it was most of my life until I got into stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.040" end="01:13:24.189" style="s2">Great so that we&#39;ll see you had a very singular life like that stuff. Yeah hundred percent singular</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.190" end="01:13:31.089" style="s2">Yeah, Annie CLE singular, but I avoided most of the pitfalls of high school partying and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.090" end="01:13:36.220" style="s2">I didn&#39;t do that because I was scared of getting hurt. I was scared if I showed up for training</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.770" end="01:13:38.770" style="s2">Hungover that I&#39;d get beat up</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.140" end="01:13:46.059" style="s2">And that it would somehow I was scared of anything that would take even a tiny bit away from my performance as a fighter</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.340" end="01:13:51.610" style="s2">Because I was obsessed with it that scare scared was that actually fear of?</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.370" end="01:13:58.209" style="s2">Being hurt because you made a mistake or fear of losing the competition or fear of failure of being harassed</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.690" end="01:14:05.770" style="s2">Competition fear of her being hurt in training training alone was as scary as any competition</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.800" end="01:14:13.509" style="s2">I just just complete completely by luck wandered into one of the best schools in the world for Taekwondo the</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.940" end="01:14:15.350" style="s2">hit</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.350" end="01:14:18.339" style="s2">they had produced multiple national champions and</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.460" end="01:14:24.489" style="s2">You know real top of the food chain athletes in terms of Taekwondo</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.620" end="01:14:30.879" style="s2">It was just just dumb luck that I walked into that school. And you know, I could have walked into another school</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:38.109" style="s2">That was a few blocks away. That was terrible. Just three I just got lucky. I got really really really lucky. So how useful</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.989" end="01:14:44.468" style="s2">How useful are the technical martial arts like Taekwondo and like in an actual street fight</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.380" end="01:14:49.630" style="s2">Not that useful. I mean more useful than knowing nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.110" end="01:14:53.500" style="s2">not as useful as brazilian jiu-jitsu or</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.290" end="01:14:58.660" style="s2">Now a lot of people now are just learning mixed martial arts</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.660" end="01:14:58.960" style="s2">Great</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.960" end="01:15:00.770" style="s2">Which is essentially what you see in the UFC?</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.770" end="01:15:07.509" style="s2">where they&#39;re jack of all trades master of none and the argument there&#39;s two arguments like there&#39;s art there&#39;s an argument that that is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.510" end="01:15:09.510" style="s2">good thing to learn and</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.620" end="01:15:11.680" style="s2">then there&#39;s other arguments that being a</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.840" end="01:15:18.400" style="s2">specialist first is the best thing and then learning the other things later in life is the best way to go about it like a</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.590" end="01:15:20.030" style="s2">specialist</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.030" end="01:15:26.469" style="s2">particularly a striker or a grappler like being an elite wrestler or an elite jujitsu artist and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.690" end="01:15:29.710" style="s2">learning all the other stuff later in life because you have such a</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.989" end="01:15:33.459" style="s2">Significant advantage if you can bring the fight into your realm of expertise</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.830" end="01:15:39.819" style="s2">So if you are a striker every fight starts standing up and if you&#39;re an elite striker and you know how to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.920" end="01:15:44.350" style="s2">takedowns and you know how to wrestle enough to keep a guy off you you&#39;ll have such a</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.630" end="01:15:49.509" style="s2">Significant advantage striking that you can dominate the competition and we&#39;ve seen that in the UFC</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.510" end="01:15:55.180" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen that both grappling and with with striking that it seems that if you become a</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.430" end="01:16:00.459" style="s2">Specialist in one particular area and then learn those other things you&#39;ll be better off</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.590" end="01:16:07.209" style="s2">But you can&#39;t really just be a specialist whether it&#39;s in Muay Thai or Taekwondo or jujitsu</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.210" end="01:16:10.780" style="s2">You really kind of have to understand if you&#39;re a grappler</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.780" end="01:16:12.780" style="s2">you really have kind of have to understand striking and</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.190" end="01:16:18.280" style="s2">If you&#39;re a striker, you really kind of have to understand grappling in order to at least avoid it</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.790" end="01:16:20.870" style="s2">Mm-hmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.870" end="01:16:27.970" style="s2">So and so during this time too. I mean, you&#39;ve got to be a pretty big guy. So when did that start happening?</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.970" end="01:16:30.579" style="s2">Were you working out like mad while you were training as well?</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.830" end="01:16:31.870" style="s2">like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.870" end="01:16:36.910" style="s2">But I was much thinner it was much thinner back then I didn&#39;t do much weightlifting because I was trying to compete in certain weight</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.950" end="01:16:43.659" style="s2">Classes like when I was 17 was one it was the I was cutting weight when I was 17 and 18</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.660" end="01:16:49.419" style="s2">I was trying to make 140 pound weight class, but it was really probably about 10 pounds plus heavier than that</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.420" end="01:16:53.020" style="s2">And I would dehydrate myself and it was really affecting my performance</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.020" end="01:16:58.360" style="s2">And then when I was 18, I moved up to the next weight class. That was 154</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.360" end="01:17:03.969" style="s2">I believe it was and when I moved up to that weight class I got way better. That was my really excelled</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.100" end="01:17:06.020" style="s2">That&#39;s when I became</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.020" end="01:17:07.880" style="s2">like a real</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.880" end="01:17:14.349" style="s2">National class athlete was when I moved up and I would but I still wasn&#39;t lifting weights much</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.350" end="01:17:16.360" style="s2">I was just doing taekwondo training</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.360" end="01:17:19.719" style="s2">It was just a lot of heavy bag work some calisthenics</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.820" end="01:17:25.269" style="s2">But mostly it was martial arts work. Then when I started getting into jiu-jitsu it was long after I stopped competing</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.670" end="01:17:29.380" style="s2">That&#39;s when I started really getting into weightlifting because jiu-jitsu</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.260" end="01:17:31.490" style="s2">involves</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.490" end="01:17:38.229" style="s2">Grappling and I think the advantage to being strong and grappling is pretty significant, right? It&#39;s gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.230" end="01:17:41.380" style="s2">and so that&#39;s when you know, it was like</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.900" end="01:17:44.229" style="s2">29 there so like that that&#39;s when I really started</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.810" end="01:17:46.959" style="s2">heavily weightlifting and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.590" end="01:17:52.659" style="s2">Later how long did your initial martial arts career last? I</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.690" end="01:17:59.020" style="s2">Fought from the time. I was fifteen and I think I had my last fight it was either I was twenty-one or twenty-two</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.270" end="01:18:06.129" style="s2">I don&#39;t really remember those but the last three fights were kickboxing fights and I had while I was doing stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.920" end="01:18:12.339" style="s2">So I was I was spreading myself too thin I was working a bunch of different jobs</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.650" end="01:18:19.779" style="s2">I was working delivering newspapers. I was working as a private investigators assistant. I did some construction</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.780" end="01:18:22.449" style="s2">I did a bunch of different odd jobs to make a living and</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.059" end="01:18:24.079" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.079" end="01:18:26.079" style="s2">Decided somewhere long</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.150" end="01:18:31.540" style="s2">Yeah, every board construction agent teaches a fighter stand-up comedian, you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.010" end="01:18:35.320" style="s2">Situation, yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.320" end="01:18:42.400" style="s2">well jiu-jitsu came later jiu-jitsu didn&#39;t come until I was I think I was 28 or 29 when I first started transition to</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.520" end="01:18:47.290" style="s2">Those that was mostly just cut window in kickboxing</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.290" end="01:18:53.469" style="s2">I really got into kickboxing and I was and I had three kickboxing fights and I was entertaining the idea of fighting professionally</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.989" end="01:18:57.098" style="s2">But I was also starting to get really worried about brain damage. I</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.800" end="01:18:59.829" style="s2">Started to see some something from kickboxing</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.500" end="01:19:04.569" style="s2">Specifically, yeah specifically because it was I was getting hit a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.570" end="01:19:05.380" style="s2">Oh, yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.380" end="01:19:11.469" style="s2">the the kickboxing spar and that I did I did that over the course of about two years where I really got heavily into</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.719" end="01:19:16.419" style="s2">Kickboxing I did a lot of boxing sparring and a lot of what you call gym wars</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.730" end="01:19:22.569" style="s2">where guys would just we would beat the shit out of each other and you&#39;d get hurt and he&#39;d come home with headaches and</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.030" end="01:19:25.090" style="s2">You basically were fighting in the gym</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.090" end="01:19:25.659" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.659" end="01:19:31.149" style="s2">It&#39;s not a wise way to do it though the smart gyms now and the best martial artists</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.150" end="01:19:33.219" style="s2">They very rarely spar hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.380" end="01:19:38.409" style="s2">They most of the time they spark technically, so they&#39;re they&#39;re hitting each other, but they hit each other like this</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.409" end="01:19:42.519" style="s2">They don&#39;t they don&#39;t blast each other full blast. They sort of touch each other</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.520" end="01:19:48.279" style="s2">They&#39;re working on timing and occasionally you go hard just to make sure that you you can survive</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.710" end="01:19:54.189" style="s2">with these techniques in a fire fight that you know how to deal with it once you get hit but</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.469" end="01:20:00.729" style="s2">We didn&#39;t really is the lower combat intensity still and still useful for training for the real thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.790" end="01:20:07.479" style="s2">Yes, it&#39;s it&#39;s but you have to have some high intensity and some people that high intensity</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:11.349" style="s2">They actually have drills that they use to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.500" end="01:20:14.500" style="s2">to simulate actual</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.409" end="01:20:19.299" style="s2">Exchanges that you would have there&#39;s a lot of science to it. Now that didn&#39;t exist back then</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.849" end="01:20:23.409" style="s2">The the gyms that I came up in were real hard-nosed</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.380" end="01:20:26.739" style="s2">Really, you know tough gyms</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.440" end="01:20:34.569" style="s2">If you if you weren&#39;t tough, you did not survive and they weren&#39;t interested in anybody that couldn&#39;t take a shot or anybody</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.570" end="01:20:35.929" style="s2">That wasn&#39;t willing to go to war</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.929" end="01:20:41.408" style="s2">So you would put on a mouthpiece you put on a cop you put your shin pads on and you&#39;d beat the fuck out of</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.409" end="01:20:43.719" style="s2">each other and that was a big part of</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.900" end="01:20:48.129" style="s2">learning how to fight it was these sparring sessions were brutal they were</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.949" end="01:20:51.908" style="s2">Nerve-racking you&#39;d be scared. He&#39;d be scared going into him</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.909" end="01:20:53.170" style="s2">There&#39;d be you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.170" end="01:20:55.989" style="s2">I&#39;d be anxious the night before if I knew how to spar a</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.090" end="01:21:00.940" style="s2">Particular guy the next day because I knew it was dangerous. You basically were having fights all the time</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.310" end="01:21:07.749" style="s2">So I&#39;d have fights several days a week you would fight, you know, it wasn&#39;t really sparring you. Did I hit guys?</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.449" end="01:21:14.739" style="s2">Covering a lot two men all the time from that so okay. Yeah. You&#39;re just big hole in this story, too</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.739" end="01:21:16.739" style="s2">So like you&#39;re doing great at Taekwondo</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.389" end="01:21:19.598" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your national level athlete and</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.179" end="01:21:24.158" style="s2">You switch to kickbox and you&#39;re worried about getting hurt and that seems reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.530" end="01:21:28.929" style="s2">because like how about not being brain damaged by the time you&#39;re 30, but then</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.480" end="01:21:33.819" style="s2">You know, I guess kind of what I&#39;m wondering is like how many shots in the head?</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.820" end="01:21:37.299" style="s2">Did you have to take before you thought being a stand-up comedian was a good?</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.780" end="01:21:40.730" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.730" end="01:21:44.349" style="s2">one of my dear friends to this day is a guy named Steve Graham and</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.280" end="01:21:51.820" style="s2">Steve was when I met him I was 15 and he was probably</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.210" end="01:21:58.509" style="s2">30 and he was going through his residency as an ophthalmologist and</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.590" end="01:22:07.060" style="s2">He had been a flight surgeon in the US Air Force and just he would he had been on the US Ski Team</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.429" end="01:22:10.959" style="s2">Who&#39;s a national skiing champion just a wild man</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.179" end="01:22:15.129" style="s2">just a guy who took chances and lived life to the fullest and was</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.349" end="01:22:19.059" style="s2">just one of the most hard-working people I ever met in my life and</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.880" end="01:22:21.199" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.199" end="01:22:26.589" style="s2">Would make him laugh and I would make some of the people laugh and training because we were always nervous</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.139" end="01:22:28.719" style="s2">Everyone we would go to tournaments</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.719" end="01:22:34.509" style="s2">We were nervous because you know, I&#39;d seen many of my friends get knocked unconscious and Easterners get kicked in the head</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.120" end="01:22:37.000" style="s2">taken to hospitals and you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.000" end="01:22:40.629" style="s2">I&#39;d seen it in the gym - a lot of guys getting beat up and knocked out in the gym</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.790" end="01:22:45.399" style="s2">It was constant and you know and you know, it had happened to me a couple of times. I&#39;ve been hurt and</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.310" end="01:22:51.009" style="s2">So we had this gallows humor mover. We would go to these events</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.800" end="01:22:55.660" style="s2">We travel to these tournaments and everybody would be the ten should be so thick</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.969" end="01:23:02.919" style="s2">everybody would just dig taking deep breaths and trying to relax and just stay loose before you fight and I would be</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.110" end="01:23:06.670" style="s2">the I would be the class clown in that environment and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.300" end="01:23:14.380" style="s2">When you were in high school or junior high like but you know I didn&#39;t have that so but I did circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.989" end="01:23:19.269" style="s2">Yes, I did have a sense of humor, but it would manifest itself in cartoons</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.270" end="01:23:25.989" style="s2">I would draw like cartoons at the teacher. You know, I would like draw cartoons of like certain kids that were kissed</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.989" end="01:23:31.809" style="s2">the teachers asked I would draw them like kissing the teachers ass and saying ridiculous things and if the teacher</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.969" end="01:23:34.989" style="s2">Was late to a class and you know, and I knew I had enough time</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.989" end="01:23:38.769" style="s2">I would put something on the chalkboard and then pull down the screen</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.050" end="01:23:43.900" style="s2">So that when they would go to use the chalkboard the chalkboard to pull the screen back up and see this</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.330" end="01:23:49.299" style="s2">ridiculous cartoon that I had drawn the whole class would laugh and the teacher would ask who did this and</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.760" end="01:23:52.930" style="s2">Luckily, nobody ratted me out. But so I that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.750" end="01:23:55.750" style="s2">enjoyed making people laugh</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.940" end="01:24:01.690" style="s2">But that was it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t most mostly wasn&#39;t things I said</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.969" end="01:24:08.919" style="s2">Was mostly cartoons, right? That&#39;s very different. Yeah. Yeah, but with comedy was with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.650" end="01:24:14.890" style="s2">Fighting when we were getting ready to compete. I was just trying to add some levity</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.890" end="01:24:21.189" style="s2">I was just trying to lighten up the mood because everybody was it was also it was a charged environment</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.290" end="01:24:26.350" style="s2">so anything that I said that was actually funny would get a giant reaction and that</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.540" end="01:24:34.479" style="s2">Became addictive and I was pretty good at doing impressions. So I do impressions of our friends do impressions of our instructor all these in</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.180" end="01:24:37.160" style="s2">ridiculous situations and</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.160" end="01:24:43.269" style="s2">My friend Steve Graham and my other friend Ed shorter who&#39;s another one encouraged me who I lost touch with</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.940" end="01:24:45.670" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.670" end="01:24:47.830" style="s2">He he said you should be a comedian</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.710" end="01:24:50.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.480" end="01:24:52.430" style="s2">my take on it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.430" end="01:24:54.880" style="s2">You think I&#39;m funny because you&#39;re my friend</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.460" end="01:25:00.550" style="s2">But other people gonna think I&#39;m an asshole at the things that I think are funnier fucked up Frank</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.550" end="01:25:02.590" style="s2">I have a fucked up sense of humor. I mean Here I am</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.230" end="01:25:08.649" style="s2">Devoting most of my time to trying to get really good at knocking people on conscience. That&#39;s what I was though</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.690" end="01:25:12.790" style="s2">so I was trying to do I was trying to separate people from their consciousness that was</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.370" end="01:25:18.999" style="s2">Doing my best every day to get good at that. So my sleep reverse psychedelic drug</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.850" end="01:25:25.930" style="s2">Yeah, it was the worst. Yeah, but it was I was trying to hurt people. That&#39;s what I was trying to get good at</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.930" end="01:25:28.180" style="s2">I was trying to get good at hurting human bodies and</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.580" end="01:25:35.950" style="s2">I just didn&#39;t think I thought that I was such an such a weirdo and such an outlier in terms of like how society viewed</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.670" end="01:25:38.960" style="s2">Combat physical</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.960" end="01:25:44.500" style="s2">candy hand combat and interactions with each other that no one would think that the things that I was making fun of were funny and</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.930" end="01:25:47.979" style="s2">This guy convinced me to go to an open mic night</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.980" end="01:25:50.380" style="s2">He&#39;s like you should go to no mic night. Just go</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.510" end="01:25:55.209" style="s2">There&#39;s a lot of comedy clubs in Boston go and watch and I went and watched and I realized wow</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.520" end="01:25:58.120" style="s2">one of the things about going to open mic night is</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.850" end="01:26:04.780" style="s2">Most open mic comedians are so terrible that it encourages you to try it</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.880" end="01:26:07.299" style="s2">This is you&#39;re like well, I can&#39;t be that bad</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.750" end="01:26:14.169" style="s2">like I I might have something that&#39;s better than some of these people and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.170" end="01:26:19.450" style="s2">You&#39;d see a real professional go up and it would be so discouraging because you&#39;d say that god my god</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.450" end="01:26:22.450" style="s2">I&#39;ll never be that funny. That guy&#39;s impossibly funny</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.180" end="01:26:24.800" style="s2">but I knew</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.800" end="01:26:29.050" style="s2">from martial arts that if I worked really hard at something I could get good at it and</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.480" end="01:26:34.540" style="s2">I had this thought that maybe I could do that with comedy because I didn&#39;t want to fight anymore</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.720" end="01:26:37.090" style="s2">I was already I was already on my way</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.640" end="01:26:41.649" style="s2">Kind of out the door. I was really worried about the brain day. I was on my way out the door</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.950" end="01:26:49.630" style="s2">From the time I was like 19 from the time. I was 19 no starting to worry about brain damage and then so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.270" end="01:26:52.270" style="s2">Like you&#39;re 53</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.940" end="01:26:59.949" style="s2">I&#39;m 51 51 51 and so much how much damage did you actually see, you know?</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.949" end="01:27:01.949" style="s2">Like lots of people. I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.090" end="01:27:04.090" style="s2">Don&#39;t know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.400" end="01:27:10.150" style="s2">How about physically muscularly and that sort of thing. Oh, no, I&#39;m fine. I had a bunch of surgeries</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.250" end="01:27:13.209" style="s2">I&#39;ve had my nose repaired. My nose was destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.510" end="01:27:14.989" style="s2">I had no nose</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.989" end="01:27:20.529" style="s2">Like the inside of my nose was just didn&#39;t work until I was 40 and then I had a deviated septum</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.900" end="01:27:22.989" style="s2">Operation they had to cut out giant</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.420" end="01:27:30.699" style="s2">Calcified chunks of scar tissue and all sorts of I literally my nose was useless until I was 40 years old</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.010" end="01:27:33.010" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.280" end="01:27:36.280" style="s2">My god</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.160" end="01:27:41.139" style="s2">If you have a deviated septum and you can&#39;t breathe out of your nose my god this I</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.590" end="01:27:46.540" style="s2">Couldn&#39;t do that to those 40. Yeah. It was just all bro. I broke my nose</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.790" end="01:27:49.509" style="s2">who knows how many times at least a dozen and</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.150" end="01:27:55.299" style="s2">It would just was always bloody. I was always getting punched or kicked in the nose</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.170" end="01:28:01.660" style="s2">As a sense organ to be at the in the middle of your face where you get punched</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.239" end="01:28:05.109" style="s2">well, it has this little tiny piece of cartilage -</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.650" end="01:28:11.650" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.960" end="01:28:15.370" style="s2">It also makes your eyes swell shut it makes your eyes water</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.620" end="01:28:20.079" style="s2">Makes it difficult to see when you get hit in the nose the in hey, the nose is really annoying</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.480" end="01:28:22.629" style="s2">But other than that I had both my knees</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.210" end="01:28:30.189" style="s2">Reconstructed ACL tears and both knees how to get them then reconstructed and you know a bunch of other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.190" end="01:28:33.669" style="s2">Oh, yeah, so you took your bunch of other broken things? Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.430" end="01:28:39.819" style="s2">Pretty good B. Yeah broken knuckles and I broke a lot of stuff but uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.400" end="01:28:46.420" style="s2">But everything works great now I mean after surgery and I mean for a person who&#39;s been through what I do</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.790" end="01:28:49.719" style="s2">What I&#39;ve done with my body my body works remarkably</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.030" end="01:28:51.910" style="s2">It&#39;s a man actually, you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.910" end="01:28:56.949" style="s2">That&#39;s a lot. You think you&#39;d be arthritic at least in some of your joints and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.560" end="01:29:02.379" style="s2">No, I&#39;m pretty good. I mean I also very proactive. I do a lot of yoga</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.380" end="01:29:06.279" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a bunch of stem cell therapies to deal with some</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.560" end="01:29:12.160" style="s2">Significant tears and injuries that I&#39;ve had but all that, you know knock on wood everything works pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.850" end="01:29:16.240" style="s2">The brain damage thing is I don&#39;t know. I really don&#39;t know. I really</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.760" end="01:29:19.329" style="s2">sit back and think about some of those Wars when I was in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.580" end="01:29:25.000" style="s2">Gym wars in particular and some fights and my last fight I got TKO I got stopped</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.000" end="01:29:29.319" style="s2">I got hit with a left hook and dropped and my legs went out from under me</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.320" end="01:29:32.739" style="s2">And then I got up and I get hit again called out again. They stopped the fight and</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.740" end="01:29:37.540" style="s2">that was when I decided I&#39;m gonna stop I was like</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.540" end="01:29:41.259" style="s2">I&#39;m not giving this the same amount of dedication I gave when I was at my best</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.260" end="01:29:47.590" style="s2">I was reading myself way too thin with comedy and I I just didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t have this same</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.900" end="01:29:52.690" style="s2">Hunger for it that I had when I was young or younger and I was also very aware of the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.150" end="01:29:56.379" style="s2">At that point in my life. I was like this I know where this is going</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.380" end="01:29:59.619" style="s2">I saw guys at the gym that were punched drop</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.900" end="01:30:06.579" style="s2">You know that were slurring their words and they would forget things and and I had seen some people</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.860" end="01:30:10.389" style="s2">Progressed towards that and it was very very disturbing to me</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.390" end="01:30:10.930" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.930" end="01:30:14.200" style="s2">I&#39;d be lying in bed at night after a hard sparring session in my head would be</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.270" end="01:30:19.239" style="s2">Pounding and I would think what am I doing in my fucking brain? Like what am I doing myself and</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.940" end="01:30:21.020" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.020" end="01:30:27.879" style="s2">Got real lucky that I found stand-up comedy. I mean if the UFC was around back, then I most certainly would have started fighting and</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.580" end="01:30:34.330" style="s2">You know and to not be training intelligently because I wasn&#39;t training intelligently</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.330" end="01:30:40.000" style="s2">I was training like a meathead and that was just all we knew back then I probably would have sustained some pretty</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.400" end="01:30:47.319" style="s2">Significant damage before I ever even got into the occupy probably would have already had massive brain damage before I ever had a fight</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.380" end="01:30:53.230" style="s2">Great, right, so you so well, that&#39;s good. So you you stepped out at an intelligent time</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.230" end="01:31:01.060" style="s2">And so then you started your comedy career and you started at open mics. And so yeah, tell me about how that developed</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.150" end="01:31:06.940" style="s2">Well open mic nights are very interesting you sign up on a list and you may or may not get on</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.190" end="01:31:12.460" style="s2">they pick people out of a hat like say if there&#39;s 50 people signing up 30 people get on and</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.890" end="01:31:16.060" style="s2">You know you each do five minutes and you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.070" end="01:31:21.909" style="s2">The the host is generally a professional comedian that brings people up and you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.910" end="01:31:28.759" style="s2">You have this weird culture of people that are struggling to try to figure out how to make a living in this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.429" end="01:31:33.469" style="s2">Undefined art form. There&#39;s no classes. You can take in it that are really worth anything</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.690" end="01:31:36.230" style="s2">There&#39;s no books that you could buy that are going to teach you anything</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.449" end="01:31:38.928" style="s2">It&#39;s something that&#39;s kind of have to look</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.929" end="01:31:41.598" style="s2">The only thing that I like it too is rap music</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.760" end="01:31:46.099" style="s2">Because rap music seems to be very similar in the fact that you have to learn from other practitioners</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.380" end="01:31:48.589" style="s2">You don&#39;t really learn from books</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.690" end="01:31:55.849" style="s2">You don&#39;t there&#39;s no like I mean, maybe there is now I don&#39;t know of any like real legitimate university courses on stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.190" end="01:31:59.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they could teach it to you. Anyway, because everyone does it differently</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.510" end="01:32:02.659" style="s2">But I think that&#39;s the case with rap music as well</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.659" end="01:32:08.989" style="s2">I think you kind of have to learn from the people that are already doing it and one good thing about Santa Comi particularly today</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.690" end="01:32:12.440" style="s2">today, it&#39;s much more open and inviting and</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.380" end="01:32:18.319" style="s2">Comedians have a lot more camaraderie than they did in the beginning because they&#39;re not fighting over scraps anymore</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.320" end="01:32:22.759" style="s2">now there&#39;s so many venues so many different places to work and then there&#39;s YouTube and</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.309" end="01:32:25.309" style="s2">the internet and</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.500" end="01:32:32.750" style="s2">Comedians, there&#39;s much more of a supportive community of people trying to help people and I try to really concentrate on that</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.750" end="01:32:39.169" style="s2">I spend a lot of time trying to help young comics. I put a lot of young comics on my shows. I have them host</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.900" end="01:32:46.489" style="s2">You know, I&#39;ve got a show tonight and a young comics only been doing it for a few years. Her name is Allie makovski</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.489" end="01:32:49.788" style="s2">She&#39;s the hosting but she&#39;s really funny and I try to encourage them</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.789" end="01:32:52.759" style="s2">I try to help them I try to give them advice and try to give them pointers</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.760" end="01:32:55.699" style="s2">I tried to when they have great sets I try to you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.699" end="01:32:58.399" style="s2">Really thank them and say that was excellent</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.400" end="01:33:03.619" style="s2">and you got this just keep keep doing what you&#39;re doing and you can really make a career doing this because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.139" end="01:33:07.609" style="s2">Insecure business, it&#39;s just so it&#39;s such a weird</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.280" end="01:33:14.719" style="s2">Undefined path that you have to take and it&#39;s and I love the art form. I love it as a consumer</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.719" end="01:33:16.999" style="s2">I love it as a person who&#39;s an audience member</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.000" end="01:33:23.209" style="s2">I really still to this day enjoy watching stand-up but back then it wasn&#39;t that supportive</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.210" end="01:33:30.169" style="s2">It was you know, we would just support each other. But the professionals weren&#39;t that supportive not like they are today few people</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.170" end="01:33:35.569" style="s2">There&#39;s a guy named Lenny Clark that I&#39;m still good friends with this day and I opened up for he was a Boston</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.789" end="01:33:39.799" style="s2">Legend and I was super fortunate to open up for him when I had been</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.200" end="01:33:46.429" style="s2">Doing comedy for about a year and he gave me some great advice and that meant the world to me and he was actually on</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.430" end="01:33:51.019" style="s2">My podcast just last month. I love that guy. And you know, he helped me out when I was</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.750" end="01:33:55.100" style="s2">Really really? I was 21. It was really really young in my comedy career</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.040" end="01:34:00.530" style="s2">Put the same amount of dedication into that that you had been putting into the martial arts</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.350" end="01:34:07.339" style="s2">Exactly. Yeah, I just became obsessed with it and I just traveled all over the place doing doing open mic nights</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.340" end="01:34:12.200" style="s2">I mean me and my good friend Greg Fitzsimmons. We started out together. We&#39;re good friends to this day</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.410" end="01:34:14.410" style="s2">we started out within a week of each other and</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.210" end="01:34:19.310" style="s2">We we used to travel all the way to Rhode Island do a drive, you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.310" end="01:34:23.899" style="s2">It was an hour-plus drive to go down there just to do five minutes</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.900" end="01:34:28.730" style="s2">And then we were at an open mic night for free and it would drive all the way home and just dream about</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.920" end="01:34:35.690" style="s2">One day being a professional that was the dream. The dream was to pay your bills by doing comedy</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.300" end="01:34:38.300" style="s2">imagine if that that could you could do</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.400" end="01:34:40.819" style="s2">Comedy for a living but that was the dream</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.820" end="01:34:46.520" style="s2">I would never imagine that I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing now, or I&#39;m doing it sold-out arenas, I doubt</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.160" end="01:34:54.049" style="s2">Bob wasn&#39;t even a hope not it wasn&#39;t even like maybe if it goes well I could do this</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.060" end="01:35:00.470" style="s2">Maybe I could do that that was never on the menu and you know, it&#39;s gotten to this really crazy</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.350" end="01:35:02.790" style="s2">astronomical</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.790" end="01:35:08.540" style="s2">Complaisant that it&#39;s very hard for me to even imagine that that came out of those</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.120" end="01:35:14.419" style="s2">strange days in Boston just traveling around all these different weird comedy clubs and</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.820" end="01:35:21.920" style="s2">Writing constantly not knowing how to write not knowing how to formulate a joke having like many more misses than hits</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.350" end="01:35:25.399" style="s2">You know a lot of bombing. I bombed all the time. I</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.020" end="01:35:30.770" style="s2">You know you got to have that ability to</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.320" end="01:35:36.320" style="s2">To bomb and come back from a Minka&#39;s. Yeah, you&#39;re you&#39;re gonna have a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.500" end="01:35:40.640" style="s2">Misses than hits that&#39;s for sure. That&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.030" end="01:35:46.699" style="s2">Question the early days. What do you think accounts for that obsessiveness that you described?</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.800" end="01:35:48.740" style="s2">And that&#39;s a negative way of putting it</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.740" end="01:35:53.749" style="s2">I mean, obviously you said that you know when you&#39;re in school if you weren&#39;t interested you weren&#39;t listening at all</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.750" end="01:36:00.109" style="s2">but if you were interested in something you would like laser-focused and that really came up in the martial arts, but it obviously</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.720" end="01:36:05.449" style="s2">Manifested itself in the stand-up comedy - so what is it about you that?</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.540" end="01:36:09.200" style="s2">Enables you what do you think? It is about you that enables you to?</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.050" end="01:36:13.729" style="s2">Zero in on something like that to the exclusion of everything else. I</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.670" end="01:36:19.490" style="s2">Don&#39;t know. I mean, I think some of it has to be attributed to the unhappiness in my childhood</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.340" end="01:36:24.919" style="s2">that when I would find something that I did get some joy out of I would just</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.470" end="01:36:30.109" style="s2">concentrate all in on that I think some of it also was like</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.110" end="01:36:36.350" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t really raised with a lot of discipline and I wasn&#39;t really raised with a pat</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.350" end="01:36:41.359" style="s2">My parents were both my stepdad and my mom were both working all the time</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.580" end="01:36:47.689" style="s2">So they they didn&#39;t they weren&#39;t really around to sort of tell me what to do or how to live and they weren&#39;t really around</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.120" end="01:36:50.390" style="s2">To let me know that everything was going to be okay</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.690" end="01:36:55.490" style="s2">They were always working so they would come home from work at like 6 o&#39;clock or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.490" end="01:37:01.849" style="s2">And you know, I&#39;d been on my own all day me and my sister had been on our own all day, you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.850" end="01:37:05.570" style="s2">We&#39;d come home. We had a key. We got into the house and it was</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.120" end="01:37:08.539" style="s2">when I there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.060" end="01:37:16.820" style="s2">Real bad feelings, you know like and when I found something that made me feel good. I just did that</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.340" end="01:37:21.709" style="s2">Exclusively, that&#39;s all I did and I still have that problem to this day</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.260" end="01:37:26.719" style="s2">when I get obsessed with something if I find something that means something to me I</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.050" end="01:37:29.280" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.280" end="01:37:36.739" style="s2">think of it all day long if I get obsessed with something it becomes it becomes like a</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.230" end="01:37:40.850" style="s2">Mantra that&#39;s in the back of my head. And I I I have to</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.490" end="01:37:42.840" style="s2">Shut it off</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.840" end="01:37:46.939" style="s2">Like I have to do my best to shut it off. Otherwise, I can&#39;t listen to people I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.550" end="01:37:50.119" style="s2">Look when people are talking to me, I don&#39;t want to talk to them</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.120" end="01:37:52.820" style="s2">I want to go do that thing that I wanted to write right, you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.820" end="01:37:56.869" style="s2">It becomes like a compulsion and it could be socially negative</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.870" end="01:38:04.039" style="s2">You know, it could be detrimental to relationships and friendships. Yeah. Yeah, but it&#39;s like that sort of thing is also</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.620" end="01:38:06.709" style="s2">absolutely necessary if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.530" end="01:38:15.199" style="s2">Develop high level skill at something difficult and unlikely because yeah, unless you&#39;re obsessive about it practice it like all the time</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.260" end="01:38:22.099" style="s2">The people you&#39;re competing with are gonna they&#39;re gonna take you out so low funny thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.100" end="01:38:25.250" style="s2">I would always be terrified that I would run into someone like me</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.150" end="01:38:29.150" style="s2">Well, okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.390" end="01:38:34.099" style="s2">But that&#39;s that was the feeder that I would run into someone who is a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.620" end="01:38:41.539" style="s2">all-in, and when I was fighting and when I lost my last kickboxing fight, I wasn&#39;t all in and I knew I was</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.300" end="01:38:47.420" style="s2">And I knew I knew I wasn&#39;t the same person. I was when I was like 18 19. I was a</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.120" end="01:38:50.120" style="s2">psychopath, I mean I was</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.330" end="01:38:53.240" style="s2">100% committed to doing nothing</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.240" end="01:38:58.940" style="s2">But that and then as I was examining my future prospects in my life</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.940" end="01:39:04.460" style="s2">And I started to become more aware of the problems of what I was doing. I became less and less</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.520" end="01:39:06.799" style="s2">I had one fight that I had in</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.320" end="01:39:10.219" style="s2">California and Anaheim in the US Nationals in</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.820" end="01:39:12.960" style="s2">1980</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.960" end="01:39:14.960" style="s2">It must have been</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.000" end="01:39:16.830" style="s2">My hmm</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.830" end="01:39:18.830" style="s2">It seems like it had to been</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.470" end="01:39:20.670" style="s2">86</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.670" end="01:39:22.670" style="s2">86 or 87</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.010" end="01:39:24.720" style="s2">Somewhere around there</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.720" end="01:39:27.199" style="s2">87 somewhere around 87 I</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.050" end="01:39:31.009" style="s2">Knocked this guy out with a head kick</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.010" end="01:39:34.940" style="s2">I did in front his pants and it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.340" end="01:39:41.239" style="s2">Everybody was people were crying and he was unconscious for a long time. He was unconscious for a solid half hour</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.370" end="01:39:45.079" style="s2">whoo, and they dragged him they dragged him off of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.720" end="01:39:51.530" style="s2">Mat they put him in a stretcher. They took him to the hospital. I never saw him regain consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.290" end="01:40:00.140" style="s2">I remember thinking that could have easily been me like I didn&#39;t have any illusions of me being some impervious in the</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.450" end="01:40:07.369" style="s2">Invulnerable person and I was really thinking about how I I hit him so hard my heel was hurting the next day</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.370" end="01:40:12.260" style="s2">I was walking with a limp from his head because I wheel kicked him in the head</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.260" end="01:40:17.690" style="s2">It&#39;s a particularly brutal move. We spin and your your whole leg comes around</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.690" end="01:40:24.949" style="s2">You&#39;re hitting someone in the head with your heel and he fell like he had gotten shot just fell face-first out cold</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.380" end="01:40:29.900" style="s2">snoring and what&#39;s the first time that I&#39;ve done that someone but it was</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.300" end="01:40:35.840" style="s2">One of the most brutal because he kind of ran into it too. He was trying to kick me as I was kicking him</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.989" end="01:40:38.989" style="s2">So was the force of his body coming towards me and me hitting him</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.119" end="01:40:41.929" style="s2">And I was thinking that guy&#39;s probably never gonna be the same again</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.570" end="01:40:46.909" style="s2">Like he&#39;s never gonna get over it psychologically or if he does it&#39;s gonna be very hard for him</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.909" end="01:40:52.669" style="s2">But he might he might be damaged for the rest of his life</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.670" end="01:40:59.239" style="s2">That&#39;s a real possibility and then I started thinking am I willing to have that happen to me at 19?</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.239" end="01:41:02.359" style="s2">I was 19 years. All those like is this is this what you want to do?</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.360" end="01:41:07.190" style="s2">Do you want to get hit in the head like that and never be the same again at 19 because it easily could happen</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.380" end="01:41:10.969" style="s2">You know, yeah, that&#39;s it. We&#39;re at 60 years to live like that</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.550" end="01:41:16.550" style="s2">Yeah, we were at an this was a national championship tournament. So he was a state championship</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.550" end="01:41:20.420" style="s2">I think from Illinois and I was a state champion from Massachusetts and</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.059" end="01:41:25.939" style="s2">You know wasn&#39;t like he would he was a black belt and it wasn&#39;t like he was an unskilled guy</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.249" end="01:41:26.849" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.849" end="01:41:30.949" style="s2">The fact that I was able to do that to him and I was able to do that to a bunch of other guys</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.949" end="01:41:34.038" style="s2">I knew that someone out there could do that to me, right?</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.039" end="01:41:36.529" style="s2">I knew that I knew that I wasn&#39;t the best in the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.800" end="01:41:43.849" style="s2">And I knew that even though I was a top I was you know, I was a real national level competitor</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.969" end="01:41:46.219" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t world class. I wasn&#39;t the best</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.949" end="01:41:48.719" style="s2">especially at 19</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.719" end="01:41:52.248" style="s2">And so that doubt that doubt stuck with me</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.039" end="01:41:57.619" style="s2">for the next couple of years and it was it was probably the first seed of</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.349" end="01:42:05.029" style="s2">My new future was me hurting that guy and thinking about what that was going to be like if that happened to me</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.030" end="01:42:10.699" style="s2">Yeah, well, that&#39;s a hell of a right turn you took there to go into comedy. So, okay</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.699" end="01:42:14.989" style="s2">so how now you became successful as a comedian, so</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.749" end="01:42:22.369" style="s2">You started playing in little clubs, like stand-up comedians did and like yeah. How did you get your breaks?</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.860" end="01:42:24.860" style="s2">How did your career develop?</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.989" end="01:42:26.849" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.849" end="01:42:32.929" style="s2">it took a few years for me to get competent, you know took like two or three years for me to get confident and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.719" end="01:42:35.719" style="s2">Three years I got</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.030" end="01:42:41.389" style="s2">Extremely fortunate again where I met my manager my manager who is my manager to this day</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.489" end="01:42:44.928" style="s2">He basically picked me up when I was an open-mic comedian, you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.929" end="01:42:49.609" style="s2">As I was getting a few paid gigs here and there but I was really an amateur. Um and</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.309" end="01:42:55.069" style="s2">He found me he was looking for new talent. He came up from New York</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.070" end="01:43:02.119" style="s2">He is he was a like, you know, really well respected and well recognized manager still is of course</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.179" end="01:43:04.399" style="s2">his name&#39;s Jeff Sussman, and we&#39;ve been together for</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.639" end="01:43:07.879" style="s2">Shit now it must be 28 years</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.300" end="01:43:14.090" style="s2">yeah, we&#39;ve been together since really since I was an amateur and he</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.760" end="01:43:19.940" style="s2">That&#39;s a successful collaboration to to span that amount of time. Not many changes</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.719" end="01:43:23.280" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.280" end="01:43:27.800" style="s2">Yeah, we&#39;ve been together forever. We&#39;ve been together forever. We don&#39;t even have a contract anymore. He&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.320" end="01:43:32.210" style="s2">We haven&#39;t had a contract and things like ten years. So doing all this time</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.210" end="01:43:39.230" style="s2">This is just like a bit of a side side question here, but you there have any time at all to pursue relationships with women?</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.170" end="01:43:43.639" style="s2">No, yeah. Well you do comedy, you know, you&#39;re in clubs at night</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.889" end="01:43:46.459" style="s2">Yeah, you have most of your day to do whatever you want</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.590" end="01:43:49.610" style="s2">You know to just when I was just a stand-up comedian</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.610" end="01:43:53.900" style="s2">I had a lot of free time, you know, I mean you&#39;re writing jokes</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.900" end="01:43:57.739" style="s2">But you can only do that a couple hours a day or you get bored and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.809" end="01:44:03.859" style="s2">effective and then you&#39;re just kind of living your life and hanging out and sometimes the best way to develop your comedy is to have</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.860" end="01:44:05.309" style="s2">good social interactions</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.309" end="01:44:12.199" style="s2">it&#39;s actually kind of important when you&#39;re an aspiring comedian to be in a lot of social situations because</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.840" end="01:44:20.329" style="s2">You are around people. You hear people say things and then you think what they say a silly or what they say is</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.329" end="01:44:27.109" style="s2">You know you disagree or you agree you you see perspectives and points of view and you kind of you</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.630" end="01:44:34.819" style="s2">Develop, you know an understanding of how human beings behave it&#39;s kind of very important. So yeah, I</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.909" end="01:44:37.770" style="s2">Was around a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.770" end="01:44:43.999" style="s2">Girls and a lot of guys and just being out and and you&#39;re always at comedy clubs and nightclubs</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.000" end="01:44:48.529" style="s2">But I did write I didn&#39;t go out. Other than that, you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.040" end="01:44:52.430" style="s2">If I wasn&#39;t at a comedy club at night, I probably wasn&#39;t out</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.800" end="01:44:53.390" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.390" end="01:44:55.390" style="s2">It was always the same thing with like</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.800" end="01:45:03.259" style="s2">My obsession with fighting and fighting came way easier for me than stand-up did stand-up was way harder</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.720" end="01:45:06.980" style="s2">For me, it was way harder. It was way harder - harder</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.800" end="01:45:11.570" style="s2">What was harder, but well, you said it took you two or three years to get confident?</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.570" end="01:45:14.570" style="s2">So that was a lot of falling flat on your face. I presume</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.570" end="01:45:20.119" style="s2">Yeah, and even then even like three years and I still could bomb at any moment. I</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.670" end="01:45:25.789" style="s2">Mean I could have a bad set. I didn&#39;t know how to do it. But I also I was socially awkward</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.790" end="01:45:28.010" style="s2">I think it took me a while to uh</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.620" end="01:45:30.330" style="s2">to not be</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.330" end="01:45:34.940" style="s2">Not be so socially awkward, you know, that was that was an issue and you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.790" end="01:45:38.510" style="s2">It was a lot of it was from my upbringing</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.000" end="01:45:42.739" style="s2">But a lot of it was also I kind of cold to me that when I was fighting</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.140" end="01:45:45.230" style="s2">Yeah, I didn&#39;t want people to like me</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.230" end="01:45:50.899" style="s2">I didn&#39;t tear like I didn&#39;t need them to like me all I needed them to do</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.900" end="01:45:53.690" style="s2">I mean I kind of wanted them to be scared of me, you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.690" end="01:45:57.649" style="s2">I so when I was fighting I wasn&#39;t trying to make friends out there at all</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.980" end="01:46:01.579" style="s2">I was I was just trying to fuck people up me</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.580" end="01:46:03.890" style="s2">so when you were fighting when we were fighting</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.890" end="01:46:09.230" style="s2">Did you have any relationships with women or was it or were you pretty not good ones? Not good</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.900" end="01:46:16.429" style="s2">No, I didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t allow them to do I wouldn&#39;t allow them to have much of my time</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.310" end="01:46:19.580" style="s2">you know, I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.310" end="01:46:25.789" style="s2">Didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t I think to have a successful relationship you have to spend a lot of time together</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.040" end="01:46:31.040" style="s2">You have to communicate you have to you the person has to almost be first place in your life</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.040" end="01:46:36.410" style="s2">Yeah, and that was never that was never happening. And so that was that would come up very often</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.570" end="01:46:40.039" style="s2">like I was a girl that I was dating in high school and you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.040" end="01:46:42.710" style="s2">I I stood teach at the school so I had keys to the school</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.780" end="01:46:48.860" style="s2">So one time I took her up there because I needed to get a workout in and she wanted to have sex</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.710" end="01:46:53.480" style="s2">At the gym and I was like, there&#39;s no way I wouldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.480" end="01:46:54.810" style="s2">I was like this place is sacred</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.810" end="01:47:00.650" style="s2">Like there&#39;s no chance that she was trying to fool around and I was you know as adamant I was like this is never happening</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.750" end="01:47:03.770" style="s2">Like this is my my we&#39;ll be a church to me</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.170" end="01:47:08.000" style="s2">Like it&#39;s not happening and you know so warranty when I was 17 years old</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.250" end="01:47:12.199" style="s2">To me at 17 or 18 to say no to sex is crazy</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.070" end="01:47:20.480" style="s2">I think we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna clip that and put it in a little clip that says Jill rule gonna tells a story that no,</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.480" end="01:47:22.480" style="s2">sane man would believe</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.400" end="01:47:29.000" style="s2">Well, you know I was that was the first refuge that I had from my life of despair</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.400" end="01:47:32.449" style="s2">So for me, I wasn&#39;t gonna screw that up. Right right</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.449" end="01:47:36.769" style="s2">I felt like disrespecting the the Academy like that</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.989" end="01:47:41.388" style="s2">Would you like an adult that something is that&#39;s something when you&#39;re a teenager?</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.389" end="01:47:46.969" style="s2">You know like to actually be treated that way it&#39;s a good thing not to mess with if you&#39;re fortunate enough to have it</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.460" end="01:47:53.389" style="s2">Well, I wouldn&#39;t even walk on to the training floor by myself with no one around without bowing</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.329" end="01:47:55.920" style="s2">Uh-huh. I</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.920" end="01:47:58.609" style="s2">mean there was no one there, but I would never</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.159" end="01:48:05.659" style="s2">Leave the the common area and step on the training floor without bowing first. Great. Never never</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.690" end="01:48:09.289" style="s2">Never okay, so when you&#39;re in comedy now</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.289" end="01:48:12.469" style="s2">You said you said you were all in as a fighter and youth?</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.630" end="01:48:15.920" style="s2">Figure you went all in as a comedian - and did you do that right from the beginning?</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.980" end="01:48:20.000" style="s2">Yeah, yeah pretty much Yeah right away</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.000" end="01:48:21.599" style="s2">as soon as I realized that I could actually</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.599" end="01:48:22.710" style="s2">do this and</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.710" end="01:48:27.919" style="s2">As soon as I realized I decided I mean my first set that I ever did I had a bunch of my friends come down</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.920" end="01:48:30.409" style="s2">And watch me I wasn&#39;t good the first time I ever got on stage</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.510" end="01:48:36.440" style="s2">But I got a couple of little chuckles and laughs and then I realized this might be possible</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.510" end="01:48:40.940" style="s2">I might be able to do this and then I became obsessed with figuring out how to do it</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.010" end="01:48:44.659" style="s2">Because it was I I saw it as a path like okay</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.659" end="01:48:47.509" style="s2">This is a thing like this is a thing you could do that</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.510" end="01:48:52.070" style="s2">You actually love I got was a huge fan of the art form. I loved watching it</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.590" end="01:48:56.750" style="s2">Ever since my parents took me to the movies when I was like 14 or 15</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.750" end="01:48:59.419" style="s2">We saw a live on the Sunset Strip was a Richard Pryor</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.670" end="01:49:06.079" style="s2">movie in in the theater where he did stand-up and I never seen that before and I remember thinking how</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.179" end="01:49:10.189" style="s2">Crazy is it that this guy could just talk and it&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.190" end="01:49:12.859" style="s2">I was falling out of my chair laughing and I was looking around</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.860" end="01:49:20.789" style="s2">I remember looking around while the movie was playing but all these people in their chairs is rocking back and forth laughing so hard</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.579" end="01:49:23.579" style="s2">Gets really some amazing</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.280" end="01:49:26.460" style="s2">Association when you&#39;re a young teenager like</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.909" end="01:49:29.909" style="s2">16 I know</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.159" end="01:49:34.888" style="s2">Bill Cosby, but I saw him live and like I saw him lad too when I was a security guard</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.889" end="01:49:38.848" style="s2">Oh, yeah, I saw him like yeah, I was a security guard at great woods</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.059" end="01:49:45.689" style="s2">I saw Kinnison there when I was a security guard. So I Rodney Dangerfield there. Yeah, so I quite a few people there</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.690" end="01:49:49.169" style="s2">yeah, well, it was something to see him sit on his stool with his cigar and</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.690" end="01:49:52.499" style="s2">Get the whole audience like literally hysterical</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.499" end="01:49:58.559" style="s2">I mean the guy in front and walk rocking back and forth so hard he could hardly breathe. His wife kept telling him</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.579" end="01:50:03.659" style="s2">Back into something vaguely resembling a human being</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.940" end="01:50:10.259" style="s2">But it was it&#39;s really amazing to see someone with that much command in the audience and so consistently</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.139" end="01:50:12.730" style="s2">unbelievably funny</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.730" end="01:50:18.419" style="s2">He&#39;s the most tragic story in all of show business. Yes, I stood</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.059" end="01:50:26.069" style="s2">Next to Michael Jackson and OJ Simpson. I mean those are the three most tragic stories in show business in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.070" end="01:50:29.099" style="s2">Yeah, and and you know, he&#39;s a monster. It&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.659" end="01:50:36.538" style="s2">You know the thing that&#39;s so strange about Cosby you think well like was this really necessary</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.269" end="01:50:43.799" style="s2">Like man, the guy was famous in fifteen different directions and really well-respected. You wouldn&#39;t have saved</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.800" end="01:50:47.279" style="s2">He would have had to date rape his women, you know, it&#39;s just well</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.380" end="01:50:52.920" style="s2">Yeah, I mean he if he just he could have just had prostitutes. I mean if he really just needed sex</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.920" end="01:50:54.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what it was</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.690" end="01:51:00.929" style="s2">I think there was a sick perversion and I think he liked to do that to people he liked to trick them</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.929" end="01:51:05.308" style="s2">I mean, I&#39;m just guessing right it has to be something cuz it&#39;s so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.860" end="01:51:07.860" style="s2">counterproductive and so</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.289" end="01:51:12.779" style="s2">Psychotic it&#39;s psychotic. I mean, I don&#39;t understand it. You know, I tried to</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.360" end="01:51:18.659" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to sort of imagine what it must have been like to be around in the 50s or 60s</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.659" end="01:51:22.018" style="s2">I think people did that to each other way more</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.239" end="01:51:28.349" style="s2">often than we&#39;d like to admit and I think that it was more casual than we would think of today where people would</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.480" end="01:51:30.779" style="s2">slip someone a Mickey or you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.780" end="01:51:36.090" style="s2">I mean he even had a bit that he did back in the way back in the day about giving someone Spanish Fly</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.430" end="01:51:39.479" style="s2">That you&#39;d give someone something that would make them warning her</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.480" end="01:51:45.750" style="s2">I think he I think he was probably a guy that had an incredibly inflated opinion of himself</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.120" end="01:51:48.450" style="s2">Didn&#39;t want anybody to ever reject him</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.060" end="01:51:50.760" style="s2">experience that a few times again</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.760" end="01:51:55.380" style="s2">This is pure speculation and just decided that he was better than people that he could just drug them</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.380" end="01:52:00.839" style="s2">It&#39;s so safe though because his comedy was basically so like it was generally family-oriented</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.840" end="01:52:03.540" style="s2">it was ya know and he put himself forward as a</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.760" end="01:52:11.190" style="s2">role model and he was credible like he was credible as an actor as a role model and he seemed credible as a spokesperson is</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.380" end="01:52:14.279" style="s2">Kind of kind of makes me think, you know, there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.040" end="01:52:16.360" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.360" end="01:52:18.450" style="s2">psychoanalysts had this guy named Eric Newman</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.670" end="01:52:24.359" style="s2">Who is a student of carl jung&#39;s and one of the things that Norman said he wrote a book called depth psychology?</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.550" end="01:52:30.150" style="s2">And the new ethic right after world war ii and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a great book a little thin book, but it&#39;s a great book</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.940" end="01:52:36.390" style="s2">one of the things he says in that book is don&#39;t be better than you are and</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.570" end="01:52:42.900" style="s2">What he meant was he didn&#39;t mean don&#39;t improve like that would be foolish he meant</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.840" end="01:52:45.840" style="s2">beware of</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.000" end="01:52:52.410" style="s2">Adopting a persona that makes you a far better person than you actually are because all of that</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.770" end="01:52:59.160" style="s2">Part of you that you&#39;re not admitting to that&#39;s gonna go off and have its own life</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.890" end="01:53:01.780" style="s2">Because you&#39;re not integrating it, you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.780" end="01:53:07.860" style="s2">You&#39;re suppressing it in some way and you know it and and so it&#39;s a living thing, you know all that</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.860" end="01:53:11.940" style="s2">Well, like the aggression you had when you were a fighter, that&#39;s a big deep part of you</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.940" end="01:53:12.239" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.239" end="01:53:13.360" style="s2">you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.360" end="01:53:16.620" style="s2">push something like that aside and pretend that it&#39;s not there and</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.720" end="01:53:20.220" style="s2">Think that it&#39;s not gonna go off and have some fun when you not paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.980" end="01:53:28.230" style="s2">Yeah, I mean like something like that musta got him is that he was he was split between this reading good guy that he was</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.230" end="01:53:30.629" style="s2">trying to be which was like too good and</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.710" end="01:53:34.330" style="s2">And</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.330" end="01:53:41.729" style="s2">and this this like more monstrous side of his personality that he obviously never integrated or perhaps never even admitted to</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.040" end="01:53:45.599" style="s2">It&#39;s really a hell of a story man. It&#39;s like and it really is a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.699" end="01:53:52.019" style="s2">I think it was an absolute bloody catastrophe for his victims obviously and but just as a general</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.989" end="01:53:55.439" style="s2">Cultural phenomenon is so awful</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.380" end="01:54:02.400" style="s2">Yeah, I couldn&#39;t agree more and it you you know you they say you should separate the man from the art</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.099" end="01:54:07.739" style="s2">But in his case, it&#39;s almost impossible to do because his art was his perception of life</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.780" end="01:54:13.349" style="s2">It&#39;s like when you&#39;re watching him, it&#39;s not like a painter or even someone who makes a movie</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.510" end="01:54:19.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like when you&#39;re watching him you&#39;re watching him now and all you can think of as he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.179" end="01:54:22.649" style="s2">Talking about these different things and about I told my children</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.409" end="01:54:29.549" style="s2">Well, he&#39;s like he&#39;s doing this lovable dad. Yeah, you know all you can think of that guy rapes people</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.590" end="01:54:35.340" style="s2">Yeah, his rugs them and rapes them. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can&#39;t enjoy it anymore and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.730" end="01:54:40.199" style="s2">Unquestionably as far as like this skill. He was one of the greatest of all time</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.900" end="01:54:47.699" style="s2">Yeah, yeah. All right. So you got you got a manager and you got a good one. And what happened? Yeah, I</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.699" end="01:54:52.499" style="s2">Moved to New York and then once I moved to New York I started</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.710" end="01:54:55.500" style="s2">Doing a ton of stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.500" end="01:55:01.560" style="s2">I was traveling all over the place and I got better and better and I&#39;ve kept working on it working on it and just</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.780" end="01:55:06.270" style="s2">doing a lot of gigs and just going all over the place and and then</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.940" end="01:55:12.810" style="s2">Two years later you were about how old were you by the time you were like paying your bills?</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.000" end="01:55:17.009" style="s2">That was your first marker for success probably like 26</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.280" end="01:55:21.750" style="s2">25 26 was when they all started coming together</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.869" end="01:55:31.469" style="s2">a lot of money I was making enough money to eat and pay my rent and then</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.040" end="01:55:38.159" style="s2">Somewhere around then I did a thing called the MTV half-hour comedy hour. That was a</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.040" end="01:55:42.899" style="s2">It was a television show. They had on MTV and each comedian</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.900" end="01:55:45.029" style="s2">I mean, I don&#39;t know how much time I did on the show</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.030" end="01:55:49.679" style="s2">I think you do like seven to ten minutes or something like that wasn&#39;t a lot of time and</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.989" end="01:55:55.379" style="s2">I had a set and I did on television it went really well and then</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.930" end="01:56:02.579" style="s2">Next thing, you know, I got all these offers to do television shows. I got development deal offers and then</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.210" end="01:56:07.049" style="s2">Before you know it I&#39;m living in California. It was like that</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.050" end="01:56:11.070" style="s2">I mean within a year I was living in California and I was on a sitcom and</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.980" end="01:56:17.909" style="s2">And then that sitcom got cancelled and I thought I was gonna move back to New York what&#39;s called?</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.400" end="01:56:23.909" style="s2">Hardball, it was a baseball show on Fox as a sitcom about a baseball team</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.690" end="01:56:29.999" style="s2">That show got cancelled and then I got a development deal with NBC</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.160" end="01:56:32.700" style="s2">I was gonna move back to New York, but I had signed a lease</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.250" end="01:56:37.500" style="s2">For my apartment. I hated LA I hated actors. I didn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.500" end="01:56:43.980" style="s2">I didn&#39;t there was so it was so disingenuous the worlds that I had come from were the worlds of stand-up comedy</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.410" end="01:56:48.059" style="s2">which is about as real as you can get either you&#39;re funny or you&#39;re not and</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.220" end="01:56:50.789" style="s2">Then the world of fighting which was even more real than that</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.700" end="01:56:56.700" style="s2">and then all the sudden I was around all these people that were just full of shit and</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.860" end="01:56:59.670" style="s2">Weird and it was that they were put on these</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.160" end="01:57:03.389" style="s2">personas and they wanted the casting agents to like them and the</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.460" end="01:57:07.529" style="s2">producers to like them and everything was fake and everybody knew was fake, but they all</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.630" end="01:57:08.250" style="s2">Accepted it</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.250" end="01:57:11.040" style="s2">and they talked faking me and it was it was very</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.380" end="01:57:15.449" style="s2">Very strange very hard for me to deal with I really didn&#39;t like actors</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.450" end="01:57:17.730" style="s2">I didn&#39;t like being and the only place that I sought refuge</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.550" end="01:57:25.889" style="s2">It&#39;s a funny thing that there&#39;d be an automatic assumption that because you were a good stand-up comedian that somehow you&#39;d be an actor</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.530" end="01:57:28.800" style="s2">Yeah to be the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.530" end="01:57:31.530" style="s2">no, they&#39;re not but</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.840" end="01:57:39.569" style="s2">The thing is that a lot of comedians had gone on to be super successful in the world of sitcoms like Roseanne Barr</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.000" end="01:57:45.060" style="s2">Jerry Seinfeld Tim Allen those type of people that had these huge careers Brett Butler</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.160" end="01:57:47.550" style="s2">So because of that all that was happening at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.770" end="01:57:51.390" style="s2">This is like in 94 when I got on TV for the first time</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.000" end="01:57:53.950" style="s2">and they</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.950" end="01:57:59.280" style="s2">That was what they&#39;re pushing and then agents and managers have pushed that too because obviously can make tremendous amount of money</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.590" end="01:58:04.920" style="s2">So that show got cancelled, but I have leased for this apartment. So I was kind of stuck in LA</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.960" end="01:58:07.589" style="s2">so I was like, alright, let me just stay out here and</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.260" end="01:58:10.389" style="s2">See what happens for a year?</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.390" end="01:58:15.010" style="s2">That was my thought and then I got a development deal with NBC</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.230" end="01:58:17.890" style="s2">They wanted to do a sitcom with me and then I wound up</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.380" end="01:58:24.700" style="s2">auditioning for a show that they had already had called news radio and that was with Dave Foley and Phil Hartman and maura Tierney and</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.100" end="01:58:28.269" style="s2">Tandy Alexander and Stephen Roode and Andy Dick and</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.910" end="01:58:36.129" style="s2">vicki lewis and we did that show for five years and then you know by that time I</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.800" end="01:58:41.020" style="s2">Had done a lot of stand-up at The Comedy Store when that show was cancelled</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.240" end="01:58:45.519" style="s2">fear factor came along and I was touring as a comedian and now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.160" end="01:58:54.160" style="s2">There. Okay. So now you go from sitcoms to Fear Factor. So how the hell yeah, and why well, it happened</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.920" end="01:58:58.000" style="s2">NBC came up to me with the idea because I was on NBC</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.460" end="01:59:03.819" style="s2">Previously and they liked me and then part of the thing was that I didn&#39;t want to work with actress anymore</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.390" end="01:59:10.599" style="s2">I was I was happy that fear factor was no actors and I was like, oh good. This is easier to do</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.300" end="01:59:19.240" style="s2">It&#39;s just me talking to people and since I had a background in coaching because I had coached a lot of people at tournaments</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.790" end="01:59:25.149" style="s2">In competition and I taught a lot at Boston University. I taught at my own school. I</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.120" end="01:59:30.729" style="s2">you know with Taekwondo I was used to teaching people and I was used to encouraging people and</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.890" end="01:59:35.740" style="s2">And getting people motivated and I knew how to I knew how to get fired up for competition</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.780" end="01:59:40.839" style="s2">I understood you were actually in you were actually one of the rare people in the world who was actually trained</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.390" end="01:59:46.059" style="s2">To be the right host for fear factor. Yeah a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.880" end="01:59:52.420" style="s2">Luckily fortuitously because I like I would when someone was nervous they&#39;re about to do something. I</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.730" end="01:59:55.180" style="s2">Could grab them and go look at me you could do this</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.940" end="02:00:01.899" style="s2">this is gonna define you with you if you back off right now and you get scared you give in to your fears and your</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.030" end="02:00:08.409" style="s2">Anxieties this is going to define you or if you just press forward and realize you can do this and succeed</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.420" end="02:00:12.430" style="s2">It will define you in a positive way and you&#39;ll build momentum in that direction</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.430" end="02:00:15.970" style="s2">You could do this and I would I was really good at giving people pep talks</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.970" end="02:00:21.099" style="s2">I was really good at firing people up and it was part of the gig that it was like it was</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.040" end="02:00:23.270" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.270" end="02:00:27.520" style="s2">unexpected because I thought the gig was just gonna be these people do these crazy things and</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.040" end="02:00:30.580" style="s2">You know I make fun of it which is part of my job</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.580" end="02:00:31.690" style="s2">And I you know</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.690" end="02:00:37.390" style="s2">We all cheer and and it would all play itself out because it was a reality show. It was sort of a game show</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.940" end="02:00:40.030" style="s2">Slash reality show was like a hybrid</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.610" end="02:00:44.740" style="s2">But somewhere along the line, especially when they became really nervous</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.100" end="02:00:51.519" style="s2">it was very intense and there was moments where I really</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.550" end="02:00:57.399" style="s2">Are one of these people to win and I wanted these people to do their best and one of these people to succeed</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.550" end="02:01:00.969" style="s2">You know and to be able to have heard</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.090" end="02:01:05.140" style="s2">You know, yeah, that&#39;s the basis of psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.300" end="02:01:11.439" style="s2">So, you know, it&#39;s really something to get people to face their fears. I mean you were doing it in a very</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.180" end="02:01:16.809" style="s2">Idiosyncratic way very very</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.050" end="02:01:20.800" style="s2">What unique way but yeah</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.930" end="02:01:27.879" style="s2">Imagine it was psychologically compelling very often got any particular one got any particular stories from that time</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.880" end="02:01:29.880" style="s2">You got a good story from fear factor</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.440" end="02:01:32.240" style="s2">Well, there was one time</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.240" end="02:01:36.280" style="s2">Where there was this couple not a couple of family</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.280" end="02:01:42.519" style="s2">It was a father and a son competing against a mother and the daughter and the father and the son were kind of jerks</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.130" end="02:01:46.180" style="s2">Which was part of the competition. There was a lot of trash-talking</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.180" end="02:01:54.490" style="s2">but they were really cocky and they thought that they were gonna win, you know, and it was you know, they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.040" end="02:02:01.930" style="s2">This the parent and child teams had gotten down to two and it was the man and his son</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.270" end="02:02:04.540" style="s2">versus the woman and her daughter and</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.060" end="02:02:12.910" style="s2">Everybody thought these jerks were gonna win it were kind of bummed out about it</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.280" end="02:02:17.139" style="s2">but the the women the woman and her child</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.870" end="02:02:22.180" style="s2">you know, they just roast the occasion and I mean I remember</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.760" end="02:02:29.530" style="s2">Talking to them and firing them up, but I still I didn&#39;t know if they could do it. What what was the challenge?</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.140" end="02:02:33.849" style="s2">It was some crazy thing that they had to climb and do this thing</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.850" end="02:02:39.760" style="s2">And the the I I don&#39;t really remember all they like that and gather flags and was all for time</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.100" end="02:02:47.170" style="s2">but the Sun the kind of jerky Sun the jerky dad, they kept screwing up and they they fucked up because you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.170" end="02:02:50.920" style="s2">They&#39;d be kind of taking it for granted that they were gonna win</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.470" end="02:02:54.519" style="s2">And when the pressure hit them and they knew it was all on the line</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.520" end="02:02:58.120" style="s2">a lot of times jerks are just insecure and</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.490" end="02:03:03.969" style="s2">When they&#39;re under pressure when they&#39;re really faced with real pressure like this is the real moment</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.970" end="02:03:08.769" style="s2">Who are you really fuck? All that talk? Who are you? Really they fall apart and</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.620" end="02:03:15.370" style="s2">The mother and the daughter one and</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.890" end="02:03:22.240" style="s2">You&#39;re talking about a hardened crew of people that watch people eat animal dicks and jump out of helicopters</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.730" end="02:03:26.890" style="s2">for season after season episode after episode, you know, we did it a</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.560" end="02:03:31.749" style="s2">hundred and something shows a hundred and I don&#39;t even remember how many shows</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.140" end="02:03:36.280" style="s2">We got probably 140 episodes of that show</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.490" end="02:03:39.020" style="s2">everybody cried</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.020" end="02:03:44.080" style="s2">He the camera people I got cry now. I&#39;m thinking about it</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.130" end="02:03:51.699" style="s2">Was a mother and the daughter was affecting I mean there&#39;s a justice to it, right?</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.490" end="02:03:54.080" style="s2">There&#39;s a comeuppance</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.080" end="02:03:58.030" style="s2">It was a comeuppance. It was an underdog it was</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.810" end="02:04:01.550" style="s2">Just seeing</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.550" end="02:04:06.279" style="s2">Their spirit, you know when when they were figuring out a way to win</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.250" end="02:04:09.370" style="s2">Watching them win but to this day</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.250" end="02:04:14.979" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you one of the things this makes me really happy about this interview so far</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.980" end="02:04:22.690" style="s2">is that like I have a tendency to tear up in interviews as you may have noticed but this time it was you so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.210" end="02:04:25.210" style="s2">I&#39;m quite pleased about that</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.220" end="02:04:30.170" style="s2">You doing</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.170" end="02:04:32.409" style="s2">Yeah, yeah, but particularly like that</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.650" end="02:04:36.549" style="s2">Sad things I tear up for happy things</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.370" end="02:04:39.080" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.080" end="02:04:44.890" style="s2">That&#39;s an interesting thing to think about too because it&#39;s not exactly happy right? It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.950" end="02:04:49.360" style="s2">As you know, when these people come up to me, and they tell me their stories</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.679" end="02:04:58.208" style="s2">Often makes me tear up because it&#39;s like it&#39;s like this blast of dead bloody seriousness with a happy ending, you know, so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.209" end="02:04:59.510" style="s2">It&#39;s a comedy</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.510" end="02:05:06.909" style="s2">because it&#39;s a happy ending but it&#39;s rough and affecting and it it it it that makes me tear up and I think my</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.099" end="02:05:13.179" style="s2">Proclivity, I&#39;ve always kind of had that ever since I was a kid but seems to have come back - will you - way?</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.179" end="02:05:17.978" style="s2">Oh, yeah. Yeah always always but it&#39;s always been happy things. It&#39;s never been sad things</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.050" end="02:05:20.709" style="s2">It&#39;s very hard to get me to cry with sad things</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.769" end="02:05:26.289" style="s2">Sighs I sort of just yeah triumph success. Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.959" end="02:05:31.929" style="s2">people pulling through like post-fight interviews when I&#39;m when I work for the UFC, but someone has a</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.449" end="02:05:37.419" style="s2">Particularly incredible performance. I have to fight off tearing up. I</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.360" end="02:05:40.420" style="s2">Feel so happy for them</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.449" end="02:05:46.688" style="s2">This isn&#39;t it strange that it&#39;s that same response to sorrow</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.360" end="02:05:50.289" style="s2">It&#39;s the same response to sorrow and triumph</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.900" end="02:05:51.949" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.949" end="02:05:58.748" style="s2">You know, like what the hell&#39;s up with that? I don&#39;t I don&#39;t understand that at all. I mean it&#39;s also a sign of empathy</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.689" end="02:06:04.059" style="s2">Yes, it is. Definitely a sign of empathy but it&#39;s what&#39;s also odd is that?</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.699" end="02:06:07.748" style="s2">with sad things I can I can I</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.749" end="02:06:09.800" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.800" end="02:06:15.130" style="s2">Objectively analyze them and I could not get sad. I could understand that</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.130" end="02:06:19.989" style="s2">This is just life and it is what it is. And I mean, I won&#39;t feel good, but I won&#39;t start weeping</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.989" end="02:06:26.468" style="s2">I don&#39;t weep first like sad things the way I weep for happy things so you that&#39;s interesting. So</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.019" end="02:06:34.539" style="s2">So in some sense, you&#39;ve you&#39;ve trained yourself to detach yourself from that kind of sorrow, but not to detach yourself from triumph</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.539" end="02:06:36.879" style="s2">I can rationalize and</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.639" end="02:06:44.679" style="s2">Understand sorrow I can internalize it I get it. I know I know what it is. And you know, I</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.590" end="02:06:48.429" style="s2">Just get so happy for people sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.369" end="02:06:53.889" style="s2">when things go well, yeah one of my guilty pleasures is are I really like</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.530" end="02:07:00.309" style="s2">America&#39;s Got Talent and the baby so prevalent. What the hell&#39;s the BBC equivalent. Is it the x-factor?</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.189" end="02:07:03.189" style="s2">Something like that. Yeah and</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.680" end="02:07:08.479" style="s2">It does the same thing to me at sea somebody could slip out there love themselves out there on the stage</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.480" end="02:07:15.320" style="s2">Looking pretty pretty damn dreadful in about four different dimensions and then like knock it out of the park. Really? Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.750" end="02:07:17.750" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s really something to</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.210" end="02:07:26.000" style="s2">Scare somebody amazing. Well because I think we perfuming being you realize how hard it is to overcome</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.120" end="02:07:31.789" style="s2">Competition or these difficult moments. So these these moments when you&#39;re tested and you know</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.790" end="02:07:37.160" style="s2">There&#39;s fears and insecurities of these people have to battle as well as the actual physical task in front of them</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.160" end="02:07:41.329" style="s2">There&#39;s so much going on and if there&#39;s so much anticipation and nerves and anxiety</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.330" end="02:07:48.860" style="s2">Involved in that that to see someone triumph. I mean, it&#39;s I am a student of human will I</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.380" end="02:07:50.490" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.490" end="02:07:54.229" style="s2">Stories of discipline and success. I don&#39;t like bad story</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.230" end="02:07:58.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t even like going to movies where they&#39;re sad, but people tell me about sad movies and like stop</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.670" end="02:08:02.269" style="s2">I&#39;m not going that movie. I don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t want to see it. I&#39;m not interested</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.270" end="02:08:07.100" style="s2">I know what sadness is. I&#39;ve been sad. I get it. I&#39;m not interested in getting that in a form of entertainment</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.580" end="02:08:10.670" style="s2">I like success. I like I like seeing people triumph</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.670" end="02:08:17.899" style="s2">I like I like that being the human spirit manifest itself in spectacular ways. Yeah, that&#39;s why I like my lectures</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.150" end="02:08:19.820" style="s2">That&#39;s why it&#39;s so fun to do them</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.820" end="02:08:25.309" style="s2">You know because I&#39;m out there trying to tell people that they have the opportunity to do that and to point out to them</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.310" end="02:08:30.229" style="s2">too that if they watch themselves, they notice they love that because you know, there&#39;s other things you go to a</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.990" end="02:08:37.880" style="s2">Basketball game or a Hawks game or something like that? Somebody makes a spectacular play and it&#39;s little celebration of the human spirit</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.550" end="02:08:42.949" style="s2">ability, I don&#39;t think impossible in the moment and everybody&#39;s up on their feet like</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.920" end="02:08:45.330" style="s2">Go</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.330" end="02:08:47.689" style="s2">yeah, that&#39;s yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.420" end="02:08:52.249" style="s2">The more that the better as far as I&#39;m concerned, there&#39;s so much. Yep</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.160" end="02:08:59.990" style="s2">concentration on our on our you know the destruction we wreak on the planet and our original sin and our</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.510" end="02:09:07.159" style="s2">Weakness and that you know, the terrible things we do to each other. It&#39;s really nice to see those situations where</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.950" end="02:09:13.880" style="s2">People are celebrating the triumph of an individual in a group like that and really says something</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.310" end="02:09:20.989" style="s2">Wonderful about human beings deep in their core for all of our problems. It&#39;s really something I&#39;d be part of that</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.929" end="02:09:29.418" style="s2">Yeah, I couldn&#39;t agree more and I think we concentrate way too often and way too much on the negative aspects of people</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.459" end="02:09:31.459" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.489" end="02:09:38.898" style="s2">That doesn&#39;t happen, you know, it&#39;s kind of strange because you do concentrate on the positive in sports</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.899" end="02:09:46.159" style="s2">you celebrate the winners, you know, the cameramen don&#39;t go over and interview the losers, you know, I mean there and all that but and</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.979" end="02:09:49.458" style="s2">It&#39;s it I know why it is that in sports</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.459" end="02:09:56.688" style="s2">It&#39;s okay to just to celebrate the triumphant and the victorious but it is okay and no one questions</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.030" end="02:10:00.289" style="s2">its or well, that&#39;s not true because now they have like</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.929" end="02:10:03.109" style="s2">non-competitive games for kids and you know</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.110" end="02:10:03.679" style="s2">That&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.679" end="02:10:08.418" style="s2">I think we correct curriculum but most of the Natha most sane people will</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.699" end="02:10:12.259" style="s2">Celebrate along with the victorious athlete and that&#39;s really something</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.649" end="02:10:16.519" style="s2">All right, so fear factor how many years did that last?</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.309" end="02:10:19.639" style="s2">Six years, were they good years?</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.849" end="02:10:22.849" style="s2">Is good financially?</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.099" end="02:10:26.359" style="s2">yeah, well, that&#39;s something me I made a ton of money and it</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.969" end="02:10:28.969" style="s2">alleviated financial pressure</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.010" end="02:10:35.389" style="s2">But I enjoyed doing it some somewhat but it was not like the way I enjoy the other things that I do</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.459" end="02:10:39.438" style="s2">It&#39;s not like I enjoyed stand-up comedy. It&#39;s not like I enjoy working for the UFC</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.599" end="02:10:44.629" style="s2">It&#39;s not like I enjoy doing podcast all those things that I just talked about those three things</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.639" end="02:10:48.379" style="s2">those things are labors of love their passions are things that I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.590" end="02:10:52.849" style="s2">Genuinely fascinated by and interested in like this conversation</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.300" end="02:10:56.989" style="s2">I would have this conversation with you if it was just you and me and there was no cameras</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.989" end="02:10:58.989" style="s2">I would love to have this conversation. I love having</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.489" end="02:11:03.468" style="s2">Conversations with interesting people. I love stand-up comedy. I love all those things</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.469" end="02:11:07.759" style="s2">I didn&#39;t love being there for fear factor, but it was a great job and I knew it was a great job</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.760" end="02:11:11.599" style="s2">But I knew I was really lucky to have it. So it was great in that respect</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.599" end="02:11:16.339" style="s2">But when it was over I kind of decided I was done with television when it was over</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.340" end="02:11:20.360" style="s2">I was like, okay, I think I&#39;m done with this no more of this from like from here on out</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.360" end="02:11:24.739" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna concentrate on my own stuff and so from then on out</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.739" end="02:11:32.119" style="s2">I just really focused on stand-up comedy. And that&#39;s when my comedy career really took off was post fear factor</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.120" end="02:11:34.399" style="s2">I mean I had a comedy career during pure fact, er</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.400" end="02:11:39.140" style="s2">But it really took off post fear factor because I really gave it all of my attention</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.480" end="02:11:44.629" style="s2">And so what was what what happened after fear factor that boosted you on the comedies on the comedy circuit?</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.440" end="02:11:54.440" style="s2">Well, I did a special for Comedy Central and Spike TV called talking monkeys in space in 2009 that</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.440" end="02:11:58.010" style="s2">was like probably my best work up until then and then</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.380" end="02:12:05.960" style="s2">You know from then I&#39;ve been on a pretty steady pace of doing specials every two years or so ever since then, right?</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.960" end="02:12:12.859" style="s2">Right, right and that&#39;s being successful. Non-stop. Are you getting better? Yeah, and it&#39;s yeah, I think I am. I think I&#39;m getting better</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.860" end="02:12:17.930" style="s2">I think it&#39;s one of those things as long as you keep concentrating on it as long as you keep focusing on it you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.930" end="02:12:22.249" style="s2">Better I think my hour that I&#39;m doing now is as good as anything I&#39;ve ever done and it&#39;s not even done yet</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.560" end="02:12:24.830" style="s2">It&#39;s only you know, six months into this hour</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.110" end="02:12:29.360" style="s2">But I think it&#39;s some of my best work ever and was really excited to see where it comes</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.640" end="02:12:34.129" style="s2">Well, I mean probably there&#39;s no rush because it&#39;s only six months since my last one</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.130" end="02:12:36.380" style="s2">I probably will work on this friend of the year</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.020" end="02:12:39.000" style="s2">before I even think about</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.000" end="02:12:41.000" style="s2">Recording it. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.130" end="02:12:43.130" style="s2">Yeah, so it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.490" end="02:12:46.549" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s a let&#39;s like a samurai sword</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.550" end="02:12:51.050" style="s2">you&#39;re folding the metal and hammering the blade and folding the metal and hammering the blade and</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.360" end="02:12:57.290" style="s2">You got to know when it&#39;s ready and I&#39;ll start to get a sense of where it&#39;s ready in about a year in about one</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.290" end="02:12:59.569" style="s2">Year, then I&#39;ll start going. Alright, this seems pretty solid</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.150" end="02:13:05.359" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s time to rock and roll and then I&#39;ll contact Netflix and I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.940" end="02:13:07.970" style="s2">Hey, let&#39;s do it, you know</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.070" end="02:13:15.049" style="s2">But so set it up and whatever just whatever city I decide and I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll pick a city. I&#39;ll pick it</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.050" end="02:13:17.660" style="s2">I&#39;ll just run it over in my head. I&#39;ll pick a name for it</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.300" end="02:13:19.830" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.830" end="02:13:25.010" style="s2">Well, maybe I&#39;ll try to stay posted on what you&#39;re doing and come down and see it. That&#39;d be fun</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.010" end="02:13:29.719" style="s2">Yeah, I may come last time you&#39;re here in Toronto, but I&#39;d like to come and see one of your shows live</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.720" end="02:13:31.440" style="s2">I think that&#39;d be a blast</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.440" end="02:13:32.910" style="s2">So yeah</p>
<p begin="02:13:32.910" end="02:13:34.999" style="s2">Oh, the next was the UFC</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.000" end="02:13:43.669" style="s2">Yeah, there was TV Kona UFC happened Morrow&#39;s on Newsradio actually wells on dudes radio</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.670" end="02:13:46.210" style="s2">I started working for the see way back in 1997</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.520" end="02:13:54.160" style="s2">But it was the UFC was more of a sideshow back. Then it was banned from cable. You could only get it on satellite TV</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.250" end="02:13:58.989" style="s2">Ran it was it was a freak show people didn&#39;t know about it</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.989" end="02:13:59.260" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.260" end="02:14:05.739" style="s2">I loved it because as a lifelong martial artist to me was fascinating to watch all these different styles compete against each other, but</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.410" end="02:14:08.239" style="s2">It didn&#39;t pay much money</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.239" end="02:14:15.069" style="s2">And even though it was enjoyable for me it got in the way of other aspects of my life. And so I quit around</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.950" end="02:14:17.950" style="s2">1998 and then</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.489" end="02:14:21.999" style="s2">Somewhere along the line in around</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.520" end="02:14:28.959" style="s2">2001 the UFC was purchased by this new company and when they purchased this my earphones are dying</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.960" end="02:14:30.960" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have to take these off and</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.070" end="02:14:33.820" style="s2">Unplug this here. Can you hear me still? Is that good?</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.370" end="02:14:35.390" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.390" end="02:14:37.390" style="s2">It&#39;s good. Okay</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.530" end="02:14:41.530" style="s2">Once it started</p>
<p begin="02:14:41.780" end="02:14:46.509" style="s2">Once the new company took over they were trying to get people to</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.300" end="02:14:49.300" style="s2">to go to their events and</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.550" end="02:14:52.900" style="s2">They asked me to go to the event, you know as when I was doing fear factor</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.900" end="02:14:55.960" style="s2">and so I went and watched it live and</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.630" end="02:14:58.630" style="s2">When I was watching it live</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.910" end="02:15:06.369" style="s2">I was talking to Dana White who was the president of the UFC and just talking about the sport and all these different things</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.370" end="02:15:12.640" style="s2">I think about and are you interested in this guy? I was asking about various obscure fighters who were competing in Japan</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.980" end="02:15:17.469" style="s2">Maybe he didn&#39;t know about you try to get these guys and then somewhere along the line</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.469" end="02:15:22.689" style="s2">He said hey you want to do commentary and I I can&#39;t I was like, I don&#39;t want to work man</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.690" end="02:15:27.790" style="s2">I&#39;m just here. I just want to enjoy this, you know, he and I became friends and he talked me into doing it and</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.580" end="02:15:31.600" style="s2">I first did it for free. I did like 12</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.330" end="02:15:35.169" style="s2">Events or so for free just for fun</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.170" end="02:15:39.339" style="s2">I was like just get tickets for my friends and I&#39;ll go and I&#39;ll do commentary for you</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.340" end="02:15:44.469" style="s2">But I didn&#39;t take it that seriously. I just I didn&#39;t everything was going to be you know a career</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.080" end="02:15:47.080" style="s2">very baby this</p>
<p begin="02:15:47.719" end="02:15:49.040" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.040" end="02:15:55.629" style="s2">Well-known commentator and mixed martial arts. I thought I was doing it as a favor for them and for fun for me and</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.510" end="02:16:01.989" style="s2">You know lo and behold here we are 18 years later. I&#39;m still doing it. I</p>
<p begin="02:16:02.869" end="02:16:04.869" style="s2">Presume this paying job</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.119" end="02:16:11.559" style="s2">What&#39;s up, I presume they&#39;re paying you now. Oh, yeah, they pay me a lot. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s better bargaining position</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.600" end="02:16:13.489" style="s2">I would say yeah</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.489" end="02:16:15.489" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s they&#39;re very generous</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.590" end="02:16:16.670" style="s2">okay, so</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.670" end="02:16:21.819" style="s2">so that that&#39;s kind of an understandable transition in some sense because you know</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.340" end="02:16:27.940" style="s2">You got you you got your social skills highly developed and you got your ability to be witty on demand</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.369" end="02:16:34.389" style="s2">highly developed and to pay attention to an audience and you had the martial arts background and so</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.059" end="02:16:39.429" style="s2">You have see commentator that makes sense instead. All right, so now</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.070" end="02:16:42.070" style="s2">Where does the podcast come in?</p>
<p begin="02:16:42.920" end="02:16:45.129" style="s2">How about how does that happen next? I</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.859" end="02:16:48.939" style="s2">Guess isn&#39;t it? Yeah the podcast was</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.729" end="02:16:54.219" style="s2">2009 I guess when I first started and the podcast was basically</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.490" end="02:17:01.089" style="s2">Um, it was just for fun. It was like something to do with my friends me and my friend Brian</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.189" end="02:17:04.239" style="s2">we just decided to set up a laptop and</p>
<p begin="02:17:04.939" end="02:17:07.269" style="s2">People would ask questions and we would just start</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.820" end="02:17:14.589" style="s2">just talking about things and then it became a weekly thing and then we started uploading it to iTunes and then</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.380" end="02:17:19.630" style="s2">you know, I started getting guests then as the</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.300" end="02:17:23.439" style="s2">I mean it took years before was profitable</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.439" end="02:17:28.389" style="s2">I mean, I just it was just for fun forever like a lot of things that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.030" end="02:17:33.070" style="s2">It was originally just for fun. Well, that&#39;s pretty early podcast too though a</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.649" end="02:17:41.619" style="s2">2009 so very early me podcasts were I mean for lots of people there&#39;s still not a thing, although that&#39;s really changed in the last</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.290" end="02:17:46.179" style="s2">Three or four years. I mean, yeah, there are definitely a</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.820" end="02:17:48.530" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.530" end="02:17:51.879" style="s2">media phenomena now, but 2009 I mean</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.399" end="02:17:54.399" style="s2">That was that was fringe stuff</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.710" end="02:17:58.479" style="s2">Fundamentally. Yes. Yeah. It was very fringe. There was a</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.660" end="02:18:05.709" style="s2">Humanizing market at that point I wouldn&#39;t have thought not much one office. No, there was no ads we didn&#39;t have ads for years</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.649" end="02:18:08.649" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.719" end="02:18:14.678" style="s2">Slowly add started trickling in the first ad was the fleshlight, which is a masturbation device</p>
<p begin="02:18:15.469" end="02:18:23.289" style="s2">So it was a funny story about sam. Harris sam harris who was a guest really early on when the fleshlight was the only sponsor</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.229" end="02:18:28.479" style="s2">Requested that we not have the fleshlight as a sponsor on the episode that he was on</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.679" end="02:18:33.459" style="s2">And so I was like, okay so I took</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.010" end="02:18:36.370" style="s2">That week off I just decided no</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.920" end="02:18:39.009" style="s2">no sponsor that week and</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.090" end="02:18:47.830" style="s2">For very many reasons it&#39;s funny video first. Well, you don&#39;t pornography leads the way right? Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.830" end="02:18:49.830" style="s2">Well, you know in the internet</p>
<p begin="02:18:50.090" end="02:18:56.410" style="s2">Yeah, yeah, it is kind of funny. Yeah, and you know was even also funnier</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.410" end="02:18:58.410" style="s2">Is that the guy who was?</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.820" end="02:19:03.969" style="s2">I guess he was a CEO of the fleshlight or marketing something or another the fleshlight</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.309" end="02:19:07.809" style="s2">He went on to form on it with me</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.000" end="02:19:15.700" style="s2">So on it, which is my fitness and supplement company. He and I are partners in this and it came out of our</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.760" end="02:19:24.099" style="s2">The thing with the fleshlight our business agreement because it was really profitable for the fleshlight and he realized early on like wow</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.380" end="02:19:30.940" style="s2">Like having a podcast sponsor something can be incredibly lucrative see if the podcast is</p>
<p begin="02:19:31.309" end="02:19:36.459" style="s2">Well respected and well received like this is sort of an untapped advertising market</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.559" end="02:19:44.529" style="s2">Hey, let&#39;s start a business and just use the podcast as a method of launching this business and let&#39;s see how it goes</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.320" end="02:19:50.409" style="s2">great, so the project and that became very successful too, but the podcast sort of</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.470" end="02:19:58.599" style="s2">Took on a life of its own it went from being just me hanging out with comedians talking to me interviewing people like you</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.820" end="02:20:04.509" style="s2">were having conversations I should say more than interviewing people like you and you know scientists and</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.090" end="02:20:06.380" style="s2">archaeologists and</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.380" end="02:20:09.130" style="s2">Doctors and I mean everyone world. Oh</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.160" end="02:20:12.160" style="s2">You started talking to everyone</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.470" end="02:20:17.950" style="s2">Yeah, everyone really everyone it was mostly mostly comedians to begin with. Yes</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.020" end="02:20:23.410" style="s2">There was almost all comedians at the beginning and that every one part is interesting because that&#39;s something that people</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.260" end="02:20:32.080" style="s2">Resist or resent more than anything now like the thing about this that you see now you see this this this expression</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.420" end="02:20:37.120" style="s2">Giving someone a platform. How would you give some of someone a platform with those ideas?</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.310" end="02:20:40.240" style="s2">It&#39;s like it really comes down to this concept of</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.060" end="02:20:43.360" style="s2">silencing opinions that you don&#39;t agree with and</p>
<p begin="02:20:43.850" end="02:20:48.790" style="s2">my thought on it was has always been I want to talk to all kinds of different people and</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.580" end="02:20:54.490" style="s2">Even if I don&#39;t agree with them, I want to find out why they think the way they yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.490" end="02:21:00.189" style="s2">Well, there&#39;s also an element of useful disagreeable to stairs. Like I&#39;m gonna talk to whoever the hell I want to</p>
<p begin="02:21:00.560" end="02:21:06.910" style="s2">Yeah, I don&#39;t care what you think about it. I interviewed Marlo speaking of people that you&#39;re not supposed to be talking to refilling</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.920" end="02:21:08.920" style="s2">Yeah, like a week to go down</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.050" end="02:21:11.050" style="s2">So heat from that</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.720" end="02:21:17.229" style="s2">Hasn&#39;t been broadcast yet. I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to take a lot of heat for it</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.229" end="02:21:20.079" style="s2">You know because it was we didn&#39;t have a political discussion</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.990" end="02:21:24.669" style="s2">When had I talked about discussion? Oh that big thing</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.670" end="02:21:32.200" style="s2">I was really curious about how he got taken down. You know when he&#39;s talking about his his his sexual</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.750" end="02:21:35.110" style="s2">Abuse when he was a kid and yeah</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.420" end="02:21:41.170" style="s2">some sense, like I watched that that interview and I knew he was in trouble as soon as he</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.020" end="02:21:49.180" style="s2">Completed it. I figured no you&#39;re you said things that you&#39;re not allowed to say and I think the part of it was that</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.790" end="02:21:56.169" style="s2">see, I was split in two parts watching it part because I was also watching it as a clinician I thought</p>
<p begin="02:21:57.080" end="02:22:04.419" style="s2">But it was admirable of Milo to refuse to take the victim stance because he had been such an anti victim</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.689" end="02:22:08.769" style="s2">What would you call it? Agitate, er or Advan, right?</p>
<p begin="02:22:08.770" end="02:22:14.800" style="s2">And so he said well I was a full participant in this but then the grunting try to be thought no</p>
<p begin="02:22:15.380" end="02:22:20.290" style="s2">Man, you haven&#39;t updated your memory since you were 14 like you&#39;re still thinking of</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.320" end="02:22:26.860" style="s2">Adult Milo as 14 year old Milo and you&#39;re not thinking about 14 year old Milo as a kid</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.080" end="02:22:32.559" style="s2">And so that was sad for me to see that because often when people are traumatized in</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.050" end="02:22:36.099" style="s2">Some sense around the area of trauma</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.560" end="02:22:41.290" style="s2">They don&#39;t mature like it&#39;s like they get stuck. Well look</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.290" end="02:22:46.870" style="s2">Yeah, imagine that you&#39;re on a path and you you you come towards an obstacle that&#39;s impenetrable</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.390" end="02:22:52.840" style="s2">But you really need to get through it to fully develop like it&#39;s part of what you need to grow up</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.840" end="02:22:55.660" style="s2">But you can&#39;t so you walk around it, you know</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.670" end="02:23:02.259" style="s2">but you leave the part of yourself that could have matured behind there and because it didn&#39;t deal with the</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.450" end="02:23:07.119" style="s2">Challenge like this is sort of what you were experiencing. Maybe on fear factor. Maybe why you&#39;re such a</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.730" end="02:23:14.230" style="s2">What you saw mostly affected by triumph, it&#39;s like you get defeated by something like that. You can&#39;t overcome it</p>
<p begin="02:23:14.390" end="02:23:17.500" style="s2">there&#39;s partying that gets stuck there in a sense and</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.080" end="02:23:20.080" style="s2">something Freud observed like a hundred</p>
<p begin="02:23:20.960" end="02:23:24.040" style="s2">my damn near must be a hundred twenty years ago that people would</p>
<p begin="02:23:24.380" end="02:23:30.309" style="s2">Fixate at a certain age because something had happened to them or at least part of their personality would I could see that happening with?</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.310" end="02:23:34.510" style="s2">Milo and I thought that he was in the routing tough spot because he&#39;d be molested</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.970" end="02:23:42.790" style="s2">He didn&#39;t want to play the victim he yet he actually was a victim which was the person damned thing and that you know</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.790" end="02:23:44.799" style="s2">The way he spoke about it could easily have been</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.670" end="02:23:47.720" style="s2">Twisted</p>
<p begin="02:23:47.720" end="02:23:51.670" style="s2">Misinterpreted partly because of his own doing into a quasi</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.190" end="02:23:54.789" style="s2">Justification for pedophilia and then he also said well</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.790" end="02:24:00.370" style="s2">You know that this was relatively common practice in the gay community and I figured he&#39;d be cut to ribbons for</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.560" end="02:24:05.320" style="s2">Her for bringing that up but he&#39;s in the interview. It was really weird, you know</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.840" end="02:24:09.130" style="s2">He said that it wasn&#39;t the left wingers that took him out</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.980" end="02:24:11.980" style="s2">There was the Conservatives</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.350" end="02:24:16.990" style="s2">the Miller had because he he was slated to star speak at CPAC and</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.660" end="02:24:22.869" style="s2">and the straight Republican types North the Trump types, you know, but but the more</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.570" end="02:24:25.570" style="s2">classically conservative Republicans</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.610" end="02:24:31.150" style="s2">Didn&#39;t think that Marlo innopolis was the right kind of guy to have speaking at CPAC</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.150" end="02:24:33.789" style="s2">and so his sense is that it was actually the</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.310" end="02:24:38.530" style="s2">More turret right that wiped him out. And so that was WOW</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.590" end="02:24:44.469" style="s2">I was interesting and but I didn&#39;t expect that and he I we also talked a fair bit about I</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.990" end="02:24:51.459" style="s2">Can&#39;t tell you all of it because then nobody has to watch the damn podcast but or listen to it, but you know</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.500" end="02:24:52.910" style="s2">He&#39;s all so</p>
<p begin="02:24:52.910" end="02:24:59.920" style="s2">Shifted his viewpoint quite substantially on what happened to him when he was 14, and he he describes the process</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.921" end="02:25:06.550" style="s2">he went through to kind of rethink that not least the controversy had caused so, you know, I think</p>
<p begin="02:25:07.131" end="02:25:10.480" style="s2">Well, that was our conversation. It lasted a couple of hours it was</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.150" end="02:25:11.771" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.771" end="02:25:15.641" style="s2">I asked him how he was doing and what he was planning on doing and and</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.711" end="02:25:18.940" style="s2">and that so that was kind of interesting to find out too but</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.761" end="02:25:25.600" style="s2">We never got into anything that was remotely political and so I was happy to have had the conversation</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.910" end="02:25:30.250" style="s2">You know to think about people like Marlo is I don&#39;t give a damn what you say about them</p>
<p begin="02:25:30.251" end="02:25:35.950" style="s2">Alex Jones is the same sort of person. I think the same thing about Tommy Robinson for that matter. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.190" end="02:25:39.190" style="s2">These people are interesting</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.471" end="02:25:43.961" style="s2">like there&#39;s range people and they have they have an effect on the world and like</p>
<p begin="02:25:44.511" end="02:25:49.450" style="s2">What are you supposed to do? Are you supposed to where you&#39;re not supposed to be curious about that? It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:25:51.771" end="02:25:54.580" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s the deep platforming thing</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.580" end="02:25:59.860" style="s2">Like they did they have this idea that you should not have a differing opinion</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.860" end="02:26:03.310" style="s2">if you have a differing opinion, it should never get a platform and</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.450" end="02:26:11.289" style="s2">More perverse than that even it&#39;s the idea that if you give someone like that quote a platform</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.540" end="02:26:18.460" style="s2">So now you&#39;re willing to talk to them that you must agree with them merely that you&#39;re conversing with them and it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="02:26:18.650" end="02:26:20.739" style="s2">That and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.410" end="02:26:23.410" style="s2">Well that guilt by association</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.051" end="02:26:27.400" style="s2">Assumption is it&#39;s a terrible assumption. What does it mean?</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.620" end="02:26:34.329" style="s2">You&#39;re only going to talk to people hold exactly the same ethical views that you hold on anything whatever yet</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.580" end="02:26:35.650" style="s2">It&#39;s not sense</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.650" end="02:26:38.949" style="s2">it&#39;s like that data and society thing that came out connecting everybody is</p>
<p begin="02:26:39.290" end="02:26:43.360" style="s2">alright gateways because they&#39;ve talked to people that are on the right, you know, I</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.181" end="02:26:46.600" style="s2">Tweeted that lady when she wrote that I said</p>
<p begin="02:26:47.240" end="02:26:51.159" style="s2">That barbara walters interviewed castro. Does that make her a communist and</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.700" end="02:26:58.570" style="s2">Basically how I might take on all this stuff is there&#39;s nothing wrong with talking to people and I feel like Milo</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.790" end="02:27:05.230" style="s2">In a sense. Well Milo, you know almost been his own worst, enemy because he&#39;s such a provocateur and now they&#39;ve turned</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.761" end="02:27:08.310" style="s2">that stuff that he was saying as a</p>
<p begin="02:27:08.921" end="02:27:10.921" style="s2">Provocateur and they&#39;ve turned it against him</p>
<p begin="02:27:11.891" end="02:27:13.891" style="s2">but I think that</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.051" end="02:27:17.341" style="s2">You and him have this one thing in common in that</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.070" end="02:27:19.301" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="02:27:19.301" end="02:27:27.240" style="s2">Categorized by lazy people who are not good at nuance and they put you in this box that other people have created</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.730" end="02:27:34.380" style="s2">And this box is oh, this is an all right. This this is a conservative that this guy&#39;s a Nazi</p>
<p begin="02:27:34.381" end="02:27:40.020" style="s2">This guy&#39;s a white supremacist. These guys are that whatever it is. They put you in that box and then</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.690" end="02:27:41.891" style="s2">socially</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.891" end="02:27:49.230" style="s2">You have to in order to fit into the ideology in order to fit into this group think you have to sort of</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.200" end="02:27:53.490" style="s2">Accept these definitions that this person is bad</p>
<p begin="02:27:53.650" end="02:28:00.569" style="s2">You know that that person Gavin McGinnis is a Nazi my lowly innopolis would not see that these people with this</p>
<p begin="02:28:00.570" end="02:28:06.119" style="s2">These are the problem without any real understanding of who those people really are without any real grounds</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.120" end="02:28:08.120" style="s2">I&#39;d have to start going to the cab</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.521" end="02:28:11.971" style="s2">By the way, we&#39;re launching our</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.061" end="02:28:15.690" style="s2">alternative social media platform soon</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.511" end="02:28:21.390" style="s2">What going yeah, it&#39;s gonna be. Well, we we tried out the first of the technology</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.391" end="02:28:26.250" style="s2">I just did debate at Slava Lygia on Friday and last Friday</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.250" end="02:28:33.300" style="s2">He was hypothetically the world&#39;s foremost Marxist philosopher. Although it turned out that he wasn&#39;t really a Marxist at all</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.301" end="02:28:35.141" style="s2">He called himself a had a lien</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.141" end="02:28:39.780" style="s2">Which is actually way different than being a Marxist and so it wasn&#39;t really much of a debate</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.780" end="02:28:45.180" style="s2">It was more me attacking the Communist Manifesto for half an hour, which I found rather</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.730" end="02:28:46.780" style="s2">rather</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.780" end="02:28:49.920" style="s2">Straightforward thing to do and then I was having a rather</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.801" end="02:28:57.211" style="s2">Peculiar and productive discussion for about an hour and a half. But anyways and things far tested their technology</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.211" end="02:29:02.910" style="s2">So the live stream technology and we&#39;ve got some cool features that no other platform has</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.131" end="02:29:04.780" style="s2">So it&#39;ll be a subscription service</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.780" end="02:29:11.130" style="s2">And so that&#39;s partly what makes it a replacement for patreon to some degree, you know, because we want to build and monetize creators</p>
<p begin="02:29:11.381" end="02:29:18.780" style="s2">But we&#39;ve got new different Terms of Service. And so the central issue with the Terms of Service will be that</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.320" end="02:29:22.020" style="s2">once you&#39;re on our platform we</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.721" end="02:29:27.301" style="s2">Won&#39;t take you down unless we&#39;re ordered to by a US court of law</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.150" end="02:29:30.040" style="s2">That&#39;s basically the idea</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.040" end="02:29:32.070" style="s2">So we&#39;re trying to make an anti censorship</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.290" end="02:29:37.230" style="s2">Platform and then we&#39;ve got there&#39;s other features too that are quite cool and unique. So for example</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.471" end="02:29:41.761" style="s2">You might be interested in this with regards to your podcast. So</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.761" end="02:29:49.620" style="s2">If you listen to your podcast on our platform people will be able to like pick a time in the podcast</p>
<p begin="02:29:50.051" end="02:29:55.530" style="s2">like maybe a 30-second clip and just mark it out and then they&#39;ll be able to either make a</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.690" end="02:30:02.909" style="s2">written comment about it or an auditory comment and then send that to a friend or post it so that then running</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.790" end="02:30:05.380" style="s2">continual running</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.380" end="02:30:08.670" style="s2">conversations in audio and written form on podcast content</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.221" end="02:30:13.680" style="s2">Constant we want to do the same thing for YouTube videos so that people can append</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.351" end="02:30:22.290" style="s2">Their own video to any part of a video and then distribute that to their network or also post it so that people can watch</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.721" end="02:30:24.490" style="s2">You know so that</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.490" end="02:30:26.970" style="s2">We&#39;re hoping we can get a real dialogue</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.190" end="02:30:33.060" style="s2">We can really add dialogue to the to the podcast end at a YouTube world</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.311" end="02:30:38.011" style="s2">We&#39;re also going to do the same thing with books. So if you buy an e-book on the platform</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.650" end="02:30:44.609" style="s2">You&#39;ll be able to annotate publicly. And so what that should mean is that every book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:45.730" end="02:30:50.669" style="s2">Sold on our platform that many people purchase will become the center of multiple</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.130" end="02:30:55.260" style="s2">Conversations and we can do that with books that are in the public domain</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.410" end="02:30:57.570" style="s2">so for example</p>
<p begin="02:30:57.570" end="02:31:03.029" style="s2">One of the books we&#39;re going to post right away is Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche and I&#39;m gonna start annotating it</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.070" end="02:31:06.959" style="s2">You know, and so what what that should mean, you know if you look at the Bible</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.960" end="02:31:11.940" style="s2">it&#39;s good example people have been annotating it for like five thousand years, right every first has</p>
<p begin="02:31:12.460" end="02:31:18.150" style="s2">God books written on it. So it&#39;s just this incredibly expanded document that&#39;s pulled in</p>
<p begin="02:31:18.851" end="02:31:24.120" style="s2">thousands and thousands of people to this collective conversation and this platform should be able to</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.271" end="02:31:32.370" style="s2">Allow people to do that with with great works of art and well and then with also with current current affairs and events</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.730" end="02:31:38.609" style="s2">And such as well YouTube videos and podcasts and so it&#39;s nice looking to it</p>
<p begin="02:31:39.250" end="02:31:43.980" style="s2">It&#39;s got a fairly professional feel. We&#39;re hoping that we&#39;ll build a poll</p>
<p begin="02:31:45.101" end="02:31:48.000" style="s2">People who are interested in intelligent conversation</p>
<p begin="02:31:49.420" end="02:31:54.870" style="s2">Specifically into this platform, you know and maybe start to pull them away from YouTube and some of the less specialized</p>
<p begin="02:31:55.510" end="02:32:01.920" style="s2">Channels hoping it&#39;s a that that plus, you know, our anti-censorship stansson, but be invitation-only</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.470" end="02:32:04.470" style="s2">to begin with so that we can</p>
<p begin="02:32:05.290" end="02:32:10.919" style="s2">Well so that we can beta test that make sure the damn thing works and that we&#39;re not fooling ourselves about its appeal</p>
<p begin="02:32:11.110" end="02:32:13.110" style="s2">so that&#39;s come a long ways and</p>
<p begin="02:32:13.510" end="02:32:21.030" style="s2">Hopefully I think we&#39;ve got four or five six people who are interested who are lined up. Ruben is gonna use it</p>
<p begin="02:32:21.030" end="02:32:23.039" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use it James all ticker</p>
<p begin="02:32:23.920" end="02:32:28.320" style="s2">Chuckle willing Michael Shermer. I think those are oh and and</p>
<p begin="02:32:29.021" end="02:32:31.141" style="s2">Carl Carl Benjamin sargon of akkad</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.840" end="02:32:33.280" style="s2">It&#39;ll be our first</p>
<p begin="02:32:33.280" end="02:32:38.369" style="s2">Beta testers fundamentally, we look awesome. Yeah. I&#39;m looking forward to it, man</p>
<p begin="02:32:38.370" end="02:32:39.870" style="s2">If if it the bloody thing works</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.870" end="02:32:44.459" style="s2">So I&#39;d like to have a conversation with you about it at some point because so for sure I would love to try it</p>
<p begin="02:32:44.641" end="02:32:47.970" style="s2">Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I&#39;ll let the let the developer know and</p>
<p begin="02:32:48.521" end="02:32:53.190" style="s2">but I think that I think the annotation feature could be really cool and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="02:32:53.860" end="02:32:56.369" style="s2">Setting it up so that if you do comment</p>
<p begin="02:32:57.130" end="02:33:04.950" style="s2">Here all the comments will be up and down voted and if your ratio of down votes to up votes falls below</p>
<p begin="02:33:05.410" end="02:33:06.760" style="s2">50/50</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.760" end="02:33:12.840" style="s2">Then your comments will be hidden people will still be able to see them if they click but you&#39;ll disappear</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.970" end="02:33:16.920" style="s2">You know from from the Main Street Minh, we don&#39;t know if 50/50 is right</p>
<p begin="02:33:16.920" end="02:33:20.129" style="s2">We&#39;re gonna have to play with that because we&#39;re also trying to control</p>
<p begin="02:33:21.250" end="02:33:23.170" style="s2">stupid trolling and</p>
<p begin="02:33:23.170" end="02:33:27.660" style="s2">I think we&#39;re gonna put a minimum length requirement on four written comments</p>
<p begin="02:33:27.820" end="02:33:33.509" style="s2">So then you can&#39;t just say four words like this guy&#39;s a fucking, you know, like no, right</p>
<p begin="02:33:33.510" end="02:33:38.070" style="s2">No need that so that you know a minimum comment length is 50 words</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.290" end="02:33:44.580" style="s2">You&#39;re gonna have to put a little thought into it. Even if you&#39;re being a troll. Hopefully your quasi witty troll</p>
<p begin="02:33:45.130" end="02:33:47.070" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.070" end="02:33:53.209" style="s2">Anyways, that&#39;s the ultimate battle right? It&#39;s trying to combat the trolls in some sort of a way or mitigate their their impact</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.210" end="02:33:56.570" style="s2">Yeah, well, it&#39;s the ultimate battle is to do that without being</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.150" end="02:34:02.090" style="s2">censorious right because yeah to express their opinion, but there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="02:34:02.971" end="02:34:04.971" style="s2">sasame, but there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="02:34:06.061" end="02:34:08.061" style="s2">productive dialogue and and</p>
<p begin="02:34:10.110" end="02:34:11.940" style="s2">Provocation without wit</p>
<p begin="02:34:11.940" end="02:34:14.060" style="s2">For the price causing trouble</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.370" end="02:34:18.950" style="s2">There&#39;s so many people out there that are just bored and that&#39;s what they use the internet for they&#39;re at work</p>
<p begin="02:34:18.950" end="02:34:23.780" style="s2">They&#39;re in a cubicle all day and they get their jollies out of just fucking with people online</p>
<p begin="02:34:24.150" end="02:34:27.470" style="s2">And my producer Jamie he has a friend. Who does that?</p>
<p begin="02:34:27.471" end="02:34:30.620" style="s2">I mean this was this friend does he has a bunch of accounts and</p>
<p begin="02:34:30.870" end="02:34:35.690" style="s2">He just trolls people he tries to troll celebrities and he tries to get them to respond to him</p>
<p begin="02:34:35.690" end="02:34:37.690" style="s2">he says mean things to them and</p>
<p begin="02:34:38.070" end="02:34:39.990" style="s2">you know, that&#39;s how he</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.990" end="02:34:44.270" style="s2">that&#39;s how he entertains himself what he&#39;s at worst a dark side that</p>
<p begin="02:34:44.700" end="02:34:48.530" style="s2">Was manifested to a much greater degree in bill call down</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.110" end="02:34:52.579" style="s2">You know now right guys the guy is also depressed</p>
<p begin="02:34:52.681" end="02:34:57.110" style="s2">He&#39;s also a depressed guy is a failure in life. And you know, is everything you would expect</p>
<p begin="02:34:57.480" end="02:35:00.470" style="s2">Yeah, who uses that kind of time for recreation, right?</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.471" end="02:35:06.740" style="s2">So, you know the issue with him is like he should take some without him. So if he would admit to himself his aggression</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.410" end="02:35:09.391" style="s2">He&#39;d come to terms with it</p>
<p begin="02:35:09.391" end="02:35:17.150" style="s2">He could take that damn aggression and he could integrate it into his personality and that would make him able to focus on his life</p>
<p begin="02:35:17.521" end="02:35:21.891" style="s2">You know, like you said when he you know, you started your your martial arts fighting</p>
<p begin="02:35:22.591" end="02:35:24.620" style="s2">and that you were obsessed and</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.990" end="02:35:30.110" style="s2">You were also sick of being pushed around at all of that and you were like willing to do something about it</p>
<p begin="02:35:30.110" end="02:35:36.140" style="s2">but obviously and it&#39;s obvious just talking to you that the aggressive part of your character is like</p>
<p begin="02:35:36.450" end="02:35:38.330" style="s2">Deeply integrated inside of you</p>
<p begin="02:35:38.330" end="02:35:41.629" style="s2">It&#39;s not high note some corner doing stupid things that you know</p>
<p begin="02:35:41.630" end="02:35:47.150" style="s2">You&#39;re not paying attention to it&#39;s right there at hand and you get a guy like the one you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:35:47.150" end="02:35:54.140" style="s2">He split into meek and depressed and ineffectual on the one hand and cruel and resentful and bitter</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.870" end="02:35:58.850" style="s2">Another hmm if those two things would marry, you know</p>
<p begin="02:35:58.980" end="02:36:03.108" style="s2">He get half his personality back and and maybe some of his dynamism</p>
<p begin="02:36:03.659" end="02:36:05.659" style="s2">So yeah waste of time</p>
<p begin="02:36:05.779" end="02:36:06.390" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="02:36:06.390" end="02:36:08.659" style="s2">think a lot of people just feel just</p>
<p begin="02:36:09.359" end="02:36:10.949" style="s2">totally powerless and</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.949" end="02:36:17.449" style="s2">They feel like this is the only way they can affect others is by reaching out and trolling or saying mean things</p>
<p begin="02:36:17.609" end="02:36:18.779" style="s2">I think that</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.779" end="02:36:26.299" style="s2">Many people take these terrible paths and lives in their lives which are not productive and they don&#39;t they don&#39;t feel good about it</p>
<p begin="02:36:26.300" end="02:36:33.199" style="s2">They don&#39;t they don&#39;t respond well to whatever they&#39;re doing with their life and they have this constant state of anxiety</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.449" end="02:36:37.549" style="s2">It&#39;s like Thoreau&#39;s quote most men live lives of quiet desperation</p>
<p begin="02:36:41.279" end="02:36:43.279" style="s2">Desperation</p>
<p begin="02:36:43.590" end="02:36:45.510" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:36:45.510" end="02:36:50.809" style="s2">That&#39;s what the Internet has allowed this. Yeah, dude, I gotta wrap this up. I got to get out of here</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.119" end="02:36:55.549" style="s2">Unfortunately, this is a long wonderful conversation though. Like we always have</p>
<p begin="02:36:56.970" end="02:36:59.929" style="s2">You got 30 seconds. Yes, okay</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.010" end="02:37:07.550" style="s2">Okay, look, what are you up to next man, like what do you want to have happen you&#39;ve got this crazy reach</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.550" end="02:37:12.170" style="s2">You&#39;ve got this crazy platform. What&#39;s what what&#39;s what&#39;s on your horizon?</p>
<p begin="02:37:12.989" end="02:37:15.589" style="s2">And I just what you&#39;re doing. No</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.109" end="02:37:21.649" style="s2">No, I just enjoy what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;d like to continue doing what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m very happy that people enjoy the show</p>
<p begin="02:37:21.659" end="02:37:29.659" style="s2">I&#39;m very very happy that it&#39;s affecting people in a positive way that they&#39;re getting inspiration out of it and they&#39;re getting information and entertainment</p>
<p begin="02:37:29.909" end="02:37:31.909" style="s2">and education and</p>
<p begin="02:37:32.069" end="02:37:38.179" style="s2">It means the world to me. I love it. I love doing the podcast. I love doing stand-up. I love everything that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.180" end="02:37:43.939" style="s2">I mean, I&#39;m very very happy with my my career and family life. I couldn&#39;t be happier</p>
<p begin="02:37:43.949" end="02:37:48.949" style="s2">So I just like to keep doing what I&#39;m doing. I don&#39;t have any crazy aspirations other than</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.949" end="02:37:53.689" style="s2">Continuing to get better at everything that I try to work at. Yeah</p>
<p begin="02:37:53.689" end="02:37:58.879" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s a crazy aspiration man because you well, you&#39;ve got a lot of things going for you</p>
<p begin="02:37:58.880" end="02:38:00.000" style="s2">You know that are very very unlikely</p>
<p begin="02:38:00.000" end="02:38:05.989" style="s2">You know and to and to hope I don&#39;t mean to hope that they&#39;ll get better but to continue to work to get those better</p>
<p begin="02:38:06.119" end="02:38:09.349" style="s2">That seems like sufficient aspiration from my perspective</p>
<p begin="02:38:09.420" end="02:38:15.919" style="s2">So low, I think you can work at anything if you work at anything, you&#39;re trying to improve and if you there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:38:16.049" end="02:38:17.279" style="s2">You know, there&#39;s always room</p>
<p begin="02:38:17.279" end="02:38:24.798" style="s2">There&#39;s always room for improvement and everything and there&#39;s a personality and your work and everything and that&#39;s what I strive for</p>
<p begin="02:38:24.799" end="02:38:31.549" style="s2">I strive for improvement. Yeah, well that edge of improvements a good place to be look I wanted also to thank you</p>
<p begin="02:38:33.029" end="02:38:37.998" style="s2">Just just so you know what, you know, you&#39;re especially that first interview he did with me</p>
<p begin="02:38:38.669" end="02:38:40.189" style="s2">That was really helpful to me</p>
<p begin="02:38:40.189" end="02:38:45.979" style="s2">and I mean, I&#39;ve enjoyed all the talks that we&#39;ve had and and they&#39;ve been really productive and they they&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="02:38:46.499" end="02:38:48.180" style="s2">Law a very big impact on my life</p>
<p begin="02:38:48.180" end="02:38:54.049" style="s2">But lots of people have watched them and so they seem to me seems to me that we&#39;ve had a pretty productive</p>
<p begin="02:38:54.930" end="02:39:01.849" style="s2">Series of interactions, but I do you&#39;ll do all yourself some. Thanks, and also thanks for coming on this podcast, man</p>
<p begin="02:39:01.890" end="02:39:03.510" style="s2">It was really much blood</p>
<p begin="02:39:03.510" end="02:39:07.459" style="s2">Matter and I will definitely talk to you about thanks lot</p>
<p begin="02:39:07.459" end="02:39:10.729" style="s2">if once we get it going and see that it works because</p>
<p begin="02:39:10.859" end="02:39:16.668" style="s2">It&#39;s look I didn&#39;t have any hope for its success when it first, you know, it was a little ugly baby thing</p>
<p begin="02:39:17.310" end="02:39:23.359" style="s2">Because you know, it&#39;s too impossible, but it&#39;s looking pretty damn good and it&#39;s got some cool features</p>
<p begin="02:39:23.359" end="02:39:27.559" style="s2">So it&#39;d be nice to have a censorship free platform if we can figure out how to do that</p>
<p begin="02:39:28.169" end="02:39:31.729" style="s2">That sounds very exciting. I&#39;m very interested. I can&#39;t wait to try it</p>
<p begin="02:39:32.249" end="02:39:33.989" style="s2">All right, man</p>
<p begin="02:39:33.989" end="02:39:36.408" style="s2">Thank You Jordan hey, thanks a lot</p>
<p begin="02:39:37.619" end="02:39:44.659" style="s2">My put it locked. Okay. Good luck with your improvement, and I&#39;m looking like you already special. Thank you. My brother. Take care. Ciao. Ciao</p>
