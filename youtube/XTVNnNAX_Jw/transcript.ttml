<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.160" style="s2">to the store</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.559" end="00:00:41.840" style="s2">howard has been one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.160" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">authors since i read his book the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.840" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">lucifer principle back in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:49.039" style="s2">it remains one of my most influential</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:51.760" style="s2">books i&#39;ve ever read</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:52.480" style="s2">i just discovered the field of mimetics</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.760" end="00:00:54.399" style="s2">at the time</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.480" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">so the the study of memes or mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:00:57.840" style="s2">viruses</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">and the lucifer principle was about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.840" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">memes turn</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">individual humans into super organisms</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:06.080" style="s2">and how they compete for</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.039" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">power and influence and resources</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s not really a stretch to identify</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:11.600" style="s2">superorganisms with cultures and these</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">conflicts with wars</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.600" end="00:01:15.439" style="s2">which means that howard was writing</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">about the culture wars way before it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.439" end="00:01:20.080" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:21.520" style="s2">uh since then uh so the lucifer</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.520" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">of many books that he wrote to develop</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:27.759" style="s2">his theory of mass behavior so following</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">the lucifer principle there was a god</p>

<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">autobiographical in nature i noticed</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">mangled the story of galileo</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">it told it as if galileo had been</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">willing to go to the stake in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">defend his truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">that turned out to be wrong but i needed</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">the heroic version of the story at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m glad i told it wrong and uh the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">second rule of science</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">says is look at things right under your</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:50.720" style="s2">nose as if you&#39;ve never seen them before</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">and then proceed from there look for</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.720" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">things that everybody that around you</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">take for granted and you take for</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">granted too</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">things that are invisible to you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">bring them into the realm of visibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">and it gave the example of anton von</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">loenhoek who invented the microscope</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">and looked at pond water and discovered</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">it was filled with an entire realm</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">of animals with which we&#39;ve shared this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">planet for as long as we&#39;ve been around</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">um invisible microscopic or</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">well more microorganisms he called them</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">animal cules</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">um and all of a sudden i had</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">a religion those first two rules</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">and all of a sudden i had companions</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">people like galileo</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">anton van loon and hope men who could</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">not reject me the way the kids did the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">way my parents did for a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">they&#39;d been dead for 350 years um</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">i started reading two books a day</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">science and science fiction one book</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">under the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">desk at school another book when i got</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">home at night</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">and then i had a peculiar experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">first of all one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">that i derived from those books that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">books seem to be saying to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">is that science is about the aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">toward omniscience</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">um there is no god there is no</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">omniscient being</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">but omniscience is an aspiration that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">exists in us</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">and as science people it is our job to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">look at even the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">overlooked phenomena and to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">into the world of science</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">so when i was 12 i realized</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">probably after reading bertrand russell</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">that i was an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">but i kept that idea out of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">mainstream of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">hidden away in a little closet because i</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">had the first party i was ever going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">be invited to in buffalo new york coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">it was my bar mitzvah and there were</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">going to be presents</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">so i did the bar mitzvah</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">um the rabbi called me the voice which</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">was very sweet of him</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">um i spent two months writing thank you</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">notes to all the people who had sent me</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">presents the stash of presents was</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">enormous</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">and then in september i was finally free</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">to call myself an atheist but there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">one small problem in the jewish calendar</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">september is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">very important because the high holidays</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">the most important</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">days of the jewish year take place in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">september</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">now my parents were not religious my</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">parents were not</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">observant they very seldom went to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">synagogue unless a friend&#39;s kid was</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">having a bar mitzvah</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">but when it came to the high holidays</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">there was a ferocity</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">in their desire to get me to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">synagogue whether i was an atheist or</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">so they got me in a suit i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">how they did that i hate suits</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">they got me into their blue four-door</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">fraser automobile i don&#39;t know how they</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">accomplished that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">either they drove me all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">richmond avenue where the synagogue was</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">and i refused to go any further</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">so i&#39;m holding on to the door frame of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">sturdily american-made car and my</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">parents are</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">yanking at my socks literally trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">drag me up the street like a sack of me</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">and something hits me galileo made his</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">discoveries by taking a brand new</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">instrument that had been</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">developed for military purposes a tube</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">with a lens on</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">this end and a lens on that end um it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">was used for looking over the horizon so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">you see the troops of the spanish</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">it was developed in holland so holland&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">arch enemies were the spanish</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.079" style="s2">and this was developed so you could see</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">the spanish long before</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">they realized you had seen them um</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.040" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">galileo had the audacity to take this</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">instrument that was designed for</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">horizontal viewing</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">and to turn it up at the sky this was</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">outrageous everybody knew</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">what was in the heavens</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">that&#39;s god&#39;s underwear that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">underside of god&#39;s living room rug you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">do not keeping tom god</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">plus god is perfect and aristotle told</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">us that the perfect form</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">is the sphere or the circle so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:56.399" style="s2">everything up there had to be spheres</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">and circles</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.399" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">galileo did the outrageous he lifted his</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">telescope and pointed it at the sky and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">saw that there were a bunch of rocks up</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">there pock marked imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">rocks and thus began a total</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">redefinition of our relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">um anton von luenhoek took his lens</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">which he used for horizontal viewing</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">to look at fabrics he was a draper and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">he looked at the fabrics he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">importing from all over the world to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">how fine weave was</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">and instead of pointing that um</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">horizontally the way he</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">normally did he pointed it down and he</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">discovered the entire</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">micro world and i realized as my parents</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">were trying to drag their firstborn up</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">the street</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">um hamburgering my face on the sidewalk</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">um that there were gods in this picture</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">um there are no gods of the heaven there</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">are no gods under the earth</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">but there were gods inside the passion</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">with once my</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">parents were absolutely determined to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">drag me to the synagogue</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">and if there are gods inside my parents</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">then there are gods</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">inside of me now look science</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:11.519" style="s2">is about the aspiration to omniscience</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">understand it in scientific terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">meanwhile um when i was 12 my</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">and my parents said look if we send you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">to this place you have to promise us</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">any of those positions</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">but we had functional committees that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">had to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">things done and kids who are popular</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">don&#39;t like to get things done they like</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">to get things</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">solely on the ability of their looks and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">their charm</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">so when it came to the program committee</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">i was voted the head of the program</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">committee two years in a row now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">the program committee the program</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">committee</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">you have five school assemblies a school</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">assembly at the first 45 minutes that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">you arrive in the school</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">every single day um i got to program two</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">and i got to emcee five of them and one</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">day the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">the juniors um came to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">and they said we&#39;re having a dance could</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">you advertise it for us no they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">realize the absurdity of this request</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">if there was a dance or a party anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">in buffalo new york my hometown</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">i was cordially invited to stay as far</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">away as possible preferably cleveland or</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">austin texas</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">um nonetheless they wanted me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">advertise to their dance</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">so i put a record on a turntable i went</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">on stage i was by now accustomed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">appearing in front of 350 people</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">every single day and something really</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">weird happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">i can&#39;t dance i can&#39;t do the box step i</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">can&#39;t do the fox trot i can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">waltz i can&#39;t do any of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">um i started free-forming and apparently</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">i was free-forming in a way that no one</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">in that room had ever seen before it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">like a looney tune drew on</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">on a night when chuck jones the creator</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">of the looney tunes</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">had dropped lsd and i saw</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">the face of the girl who loathed me the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">most i saw her</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">eyes widening i saw her pupils dilated</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">i saw her face melting i saw all the 349</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">other people&#39;s faces melting at the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">i saw them melting into one giant</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">communal blob of energy</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">i saw that amoebic blob of energy reach</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">the pseudopod out to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">and send the energy of 350 people</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">through me as if i were an empty pipe</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">i had an out-of-body experience i was on</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">the ceiling</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">watching all of this take place and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:20.600" style="s2">saw that energy go up around</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">some place around my head become utterly</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.600" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">transmogrified and flow back to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">and when i finished when the song was</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">over three and a half minutes later</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">the audience did something it looked</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">like it had practiced</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:35.920" style="s2">all its life it was so good at it but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:37.519" style="s2">had never done in my time at that school</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.920" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">not for homecoming queens</p>

<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">um it surged down to the foot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:49.839" style="s2">it picked me up on its shoulders and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">carried me out of the auditorium and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.839" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">carried me carried me all the way up the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">walkway to the building</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">where we had classes so all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">the the ecstatic experience that i had</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">been pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">for scientific purposes and personal</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">purposes since i was 12 years old</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">had hit me over the head and carried me</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">utterly away</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">and it became my key to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">people like michael jackson prince bob</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">you have to reverse that order i want</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">physics first</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">so that you would teach me the origins</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">of the first elementary</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">particles teach me about the big bang by</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">controversial</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">at that point um fred hoyle the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">was behind steady state theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">universe thought that that was the year</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">he would knock big bang out of existence</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">forever um big bang theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">so i want you to teach me physics you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">teach me the big bang and the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">the first particles</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">social groups i want you to teach me</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:36.240" style="s2">biology third because that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">you have to teach me what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.240" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">molecules get together in</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">mega molecules and achieve the ability</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">then i want you to teach me anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">so that we get to the origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">first human societies</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">then i want you to teach me history and</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">are feelers we are antennae for a cosmo</p>

<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">that is a lot to process um</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">so i&#39;ve noticed that you often use</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">religious language</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">in your your books you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">gods within you&#39;ve mentioned divinity</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">and soul of course is the subtitle of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">your latest book</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.799" style="s2">um as a scientist how do you understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">these terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.799" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">um that&#39;s a good question because as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">scientist</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">it is hard look you have certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">sciences where you could define your</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">um but the reality of science is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">feeling out things that are unknown</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">and right now soul and the gods within</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">are unknown now</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">back when i was uh 14 years old i had</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">as you know utterly fascinated by the</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">for two years and then i heard that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">there was a book called the varieties of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">the religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">by william james now we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">amazon in those days and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">buffalo was not exactly a book rich town</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">but i went on a hunt</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">for that book and i finally found it at</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">the university of buffalo bookstore</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">and it was as if william james had</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">laid out a bunch of these ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">on a lab bench and said directly to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">in 1902 i do not have the tools with</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">which to understand these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">but you&#39;re coming along in the 1950s and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">1960s</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">and you will have the tools</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">with which to understand these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">but he left me well he gave examples of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">people like george fox</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">who saw blood raining down from the sky</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">and gushing through the streets</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:10.320" style="s2">of litchfield he gave the example of um</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">of theresa saint teresa who was a nun</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.320" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">alone in a stone a dark stone cell</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">at night and she felt angels penetrate</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.640" style="s2">the walls</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">and push uh spears</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.640" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">into her entrails and that push gave her</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.000" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">ecstasies beyond belief</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">and she felt that in the arms of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">angels in the arms of christ himself</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">that she soared over the landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">and she was filled with the love of god</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">that is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:41.039" style="s2">uh the powers of description well you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">know that at the age of 16 i</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.039" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">had one of those experiences william</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">james did say this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:47.840" style="s2">he said every one of the experiences</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">that i&#39;ve described to you as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.840" end="00:27:52.440" style="s2">psychopathology</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">yet in the hands of certain people</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.440" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">psychopathologies</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">can become the engines of history</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">so with my scientific tools i had</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">started in microbiology and theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">physics i had my</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">first meeting with the head of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">graduate physics department at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">university of buffalo</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">when i was 12 we discussed big bangers</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">to steady state degree of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">and the interpretation of the doppler</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">shift and he came out of his office and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">put his hand</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">on my shoulder and said to my mom you</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have to save for grad school for</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:23.840" style="s2">he&#39;ll get fellowships and theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">physics at any school he wants</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">but i knew those tools had to be applied</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">to one of the most obvious things</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">under our noses and behind our noses the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">gods within</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">to our emotions um to our passions</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve been on the track of joining</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">these things together</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">they are in the same universe david and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">they&#39;re in the same universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">for a reason if we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">things like consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">and human passion and the gods within us</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">our understanding even of the big bang</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">and its first elementary particles</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">is going to be missing something big and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.799" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">in fact it is something too big</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">because we take the er sicilian approach</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">of breaking things down to their</p>

<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">and understanding them we fail to</p>

<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">and those are the really big deal we</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">to understand the super-sized surprises</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">not only can&#39;t we predict them we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">even recognize that they exist</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">which means our science is a primitive</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">that welded them to their audience</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">if we don&#39;t understand those mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">we don&#39;t really understand this cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">we are still in science 101.</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">right um yeah i understand that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">the the things that you&#39;re referencing</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">with religious</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">they&#39;re important they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.039" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">emergent properties i just wonder if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">the same things that religious people</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">are talking about when they use the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">well they they couch it in a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">world view</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">in their world view there is a god</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">in their worldview there is a heaven</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">and a hell in my worldview because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">uh a secular humanist is what i guess</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">you could call me</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">um there is no god and the trick is to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">explain these things without a god</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">um because they are real as you said</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">they are real</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">if you you need to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">passion</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:08.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to understand the rise</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:11.279" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.720" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">islamic civilization and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">extremely important part of human</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">and science is about the aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">toward omniscience</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">so science has to grab everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">and try both to experience it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">explain it</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">right um just want to mention</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">at least would what domain would it</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">appear in uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">you know would it be an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">property of human social interactions or</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">a property of our technological systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.399" style="s2">could you make any predictions about its</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">attributes</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">um i think it does remember we humans</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">like every species that ever existed</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">are antennae feelers for a cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">feeling out her potential</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">and through us she&#39;s found a way to feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">out her potential much faster</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">than any previous system has ever been</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">able to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">so back around 1800</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">super-sized surprises has happened at</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">the rate of one every 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:06.399" style="s2">um massive technological revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">happened at the rate of less than one</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.399" end="00:33:10.399" style="s2">every 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">and all of a sudden in 1800 things</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.399" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">accelerated</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">and whole new technologies began to come</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">into existence</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">every 15 years um</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">there was the telegraph there was</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">the railroad these two things alone</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">utterly changed the way we see ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">on this planet because up until then our</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">effective range of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">had been 20 miles um it was 20 miles</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">because people used to go out on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">sunday and walk 40 miles in those days</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">20 miles out and 20 miles back as hard</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">as that is to believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.840" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">just for pleasure but all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.480" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">these that were far far apart</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">the railroad um an expert said sorry</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">howard</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">um you froze for a few seconds here can</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">repeat the last 10 seconds or so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">the railroad</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">uh for the telegraph once there was were</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">trans uh transcontinental and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">trans-oceanic tables</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">made it possible for you to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">with people thousands</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">of miles away um</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">experts said when the idea of railroads</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">were first being floated</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">that humans could not possibly possibly</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">travel at a speed greater than 11 miles</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">an hour</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">if you try to get humans traveling at 20</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">miles an hour the wind would suck the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">breath</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:43.599" style="s2">out of your lungs and would kill you um</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">that did not exactly prove to be right</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.599" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">um what&#39;s his name scott&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">walter scott you know the famous</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">novelist</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">said there is there will never be a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">in which you can use</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">steam engines for a locomotion never</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">and yet somebody managed to take a steam</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">engine which tended to be the size of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">small building</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">turned it on its side put wheels on it</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">and all of a sudden you had the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">locomotive so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">people like uh herbert spencer and his</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">friends uh john stuart mill</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">um and his and the woman who really</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">wanted him more than anything</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">travel 40 miles and then walk</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">this changed the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">humans and their sense of</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">and remember the second rule of science</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">they are changing the very nature of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">what it means to be a human being</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">when i first met elon musk in 2005</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">and he had never flown anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">and the people at nasa were laughing</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">he said when i got out of college i</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">asked myself</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">what three things would do the most to</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">change humanity</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">in my lifetime and his answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">question was</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">the internet alternative energy and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:19.040" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">so he went into the internet business</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.040" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">and you know help build paypal</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">and then have it made between 800</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">million and a billion dollars when he</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">sold his share</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">um i skipped over number two alternative</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">although he&#39;s been working steadily on</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">that for years without a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">publicity</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">and went to number three rocketry um</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">getting humans uh beyond the gravity</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">um what was important was the way he</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.760" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">phrased it</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:48.839" style="s2">i asked what three things would do the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">most to change</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.839" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">humanity in my lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">we are somehow we&#39;re like gyroscopes</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">a gyroscope maintains its position</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">no matter what you try to do to disturb</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">it and we have a gyroscopic</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">sense of what it means to be a human</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">and we absorb all of these shape shocks</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">all of these super-sized surprises</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">hitting us right and left and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">normalize them somehow</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:20.880" style="s2">and then we sit down and we read plato</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">and we imagine that he had a mind</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.880" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">exactly like ours and that he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">directly to us</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">or saint augustine who&#39;s so contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">in the way he writes that it defies</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">no they lived in an utterly different</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">perceptual cosmos than</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">we do and the cosmos we live in</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">contains humans like you and me who have</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">broken so many of nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">rules and do it so much every day that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">it utterly</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">defies belief for example in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.400" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">you wake up you swing your feet</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">off the bed and you put your feet on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">floor</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">and then you stand up um i am online</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">nature loves those who oppose her most</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve just said [ __ ] you to nature</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">nature&#39;s most basic law is gravity</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">then there are her laws of physics which</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">say if you stand a pencil on its end</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s going to fall over</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">and you&#39;ve just done the pencil on its</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">end act not only have you defied gravity</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.560" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">by standing up instead of laying there</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">limpy like a jellyfish on a mattress all</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">um you you have done it with a software</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">your vestibul the vestibular part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">your brain handles balance</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">and manages to pull off the pencil on</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">its point trick</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">and it does it all the rest of the day</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">and you don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">how nature has made you to say [ __ ] you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">to her that&#39;s how nature explores</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">who&#39;s her next super sized surprise but</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">she&#39;s achieving those every five years</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">through human technological innovation</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">thank you um i&#39;ve got a question from</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">anjen</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">to paraphrase the grand theory is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">tendency for parts to come together</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">into holes that have new properties</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">really and everything that exists</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">is the furthering of this trend so why</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">is there a tendency towards coming</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">together complexity and efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">uh that&#39;s a very good question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to pythagoras have you</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:37.119" style="s2">pythagoras ted trap tech tractus</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a little pyramid made of dots at</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">the top is one dot below that are two</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">dots below that or three dots below that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">or four dots</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s a total of ten dots well what</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">er</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">what pythagoras is saying is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">universe begins as a one</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:56.079" style="s2">and it does it begins not just with</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">nothingness it begins with a sheet of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:40:59.640" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">time and speed and then it</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.640" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">individuates into two</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">and then it individually</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">further and i don&#39;t remember what three</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">means probably groups as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:15.359" style="s2">pairs</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">one way or the other this cosmos if our</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">theories of the big bang</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">are correct started as a singularity</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">a singleness um that differentiated into</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">spacetime and speed</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">giant super-sized surprises if you and i</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.960" end="00:41:32.160" style="s2">had been sitting at a coffee table</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">before the beginning of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.160" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">and you had predicted that a dot</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">infinitely smaller than a dot</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">not far away from us would suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">burst</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">open like a flower and produce time</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">space and speed i would say you were</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">time is simply too bizarre a concept to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">ever exist</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">so is space and speed</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">is the product of time and space</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s totally whacked out too and all</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">of a sudden it would be there</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">and then you would make another bizarre</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">certainly thank you uh you want me to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">read my question</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:53.119" style="s2">there were just two uh basically uh two</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.119" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">statements that science uh is omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">or will be an omniscient as the sense i</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.119" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">i understood and that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">science under science 101</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">which is kind of more something i would</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">be able to get behind</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">so which which is your belief howard my</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">belief is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">science contains the aspiration toward</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">omniscience</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">um omniscience is something we can chase</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">for the rest of our lives and never get</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">omniscience is something that the that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">the human race</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">can continue to chase after for the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">200 generations</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">and never achieve because the universe</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">is constantly complexifying</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">um we are helping it do that among other</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">things and catching up with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.480" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">complexification process would be very</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">difficult but that is our mission</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">that is what we need to attempt so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">see that as</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">you see that as a singularity that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">trying to achieve well it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">singularity it&#39;s a continuous process</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">um but it&#39;s a continuous process we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:08.079" style="s2">to throw ourselves into with all our</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:08.079" style="s2">hearts souls and brains</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s a destiny yeah it&#39;s a destiny</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a destiny is what you feel inside</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">of you that you make happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">not that makes you happy even though it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">does drive you</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">okay so i mean answer to that question</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:36.640" style="s2">because i&#39;ve imagined that every</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.119" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">universe values the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.640" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">super-sized surprises but</p>

<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">in its competition with other cosmoses</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:02.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">and if indeed there are different</p>

<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">that is driven inevitably toward them</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">just can&#39;t stop herself from producing</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">them as god i would think a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">edge if it&#39;s in a world of other</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">cosmoses</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.319" end="00:54:01.680" style="s2">nature of consciousness and how it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">relates to physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.680" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">um so i&#39;m kind of wondering uh if</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:07.359" style="s2">anything like resulting in monism</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:09.839" style="s2">and you mentioned bertrand russell</p>

<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">reflections are there and then the last</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">piece i want to throw in just based on</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">was um uh whether or not there</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">is kind of an observer effect or um</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:28.319" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">universes that have this property of</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.319" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">being able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">create new um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">basically creating uh you know an</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">emerging properties of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">a universe are more likely to create</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:40.799" style="s2">consciousness and therefore be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:42.960" style="s2">of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.799" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">so well that&#39;s uh we could do a whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">night on that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">um dualism dualism is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">properties of the cosmos it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">show up between</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">it&#39;s there from the very get-go and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">know one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">rules of the grand unified theory is</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">opposites are joined to the hip so we</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:07.200" style="s2">tend to regard two</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:08.799" style="s2">things as opposites when in reality you</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.200" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">know how a curtain rod</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.799" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">has a big ball on one end a big</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">decorative ball and a big decorative</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">ball on the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">but they&#39;re joined by the rod in between</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s how opposites are</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:26.880" style="s2">i mean just the molecule that makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">um oh god i&#39;m trying to think of uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.880" end="00:55:30.799" style="s2">what tends to happen is if you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">molecules that have opposite impacts</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.799" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">like one is a vasoconstrictor and one is</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">a vasodilator</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">they tend to come from the same parent</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">they are different ends of the very same</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">parent molecule um think about</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">sharingtonian behavior um it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:55.119" style="s2">talked about much these days at all</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">but sharingtonian behavior in</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.119" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">neuroscience is you&#39;ve got a system</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">it has an exciter and it has</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:08.160" style="s2">an inhibitor and the maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">balance between these two</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.160" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">is excruciatingly important when you</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">hear</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">a loud bang out on the street that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">if you watch carefully when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">having that experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a sharing newtonian system</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">with an exciter and an inhibitor</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">and that that works like uh a</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">what do they call those dials on</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:34.240" style="s2">automobiles that give you the rpm</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">um but it has a red zone it has a green</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.240" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">zone</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">so at any rate all of a sudden you go</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">over into the red zone of stress because</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.280" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">you have no idea what the sound is</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">once you are whatever you call your mind</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">consults its uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:51.520" style="s2">conscious centers and comes up with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">notion that this is just a motorcycle</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.520" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">um making a a a big burp a banging burp</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.920" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">then all of a sudden that that thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">back up into the middle zone</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:06.640" style="s2">again and it&#39;s all because of a balance</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.640" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">um exciters and inhibitors</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:13.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s an entire system in the body</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.359" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">seems to be studying that&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">this kind of a balance</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the glutamate and gaba system</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">glutamate is the cider and gaba</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">is the inhibitor and i had to discover</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">this the hard way</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">because i came down with an illness that</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">landed me in bed</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">for five for 15 years and too weak to</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:38.640" style="s2">or to have another person in the room</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:41.200" style="s2">with me for five</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.640" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">and what i discovered was that this i</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.200" end="00:57:45.599" style="s2">call it a stress handling system</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">with yabba on one side and glutamate on</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.599" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">was way out of whack and my body was</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">constantly in the very</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">very end of the end zone because it had</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:56.640" style="s2">no inhibitors</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:59.440" style="s2">so first i discovered that one thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">that could help me enormously was valium</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.440" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">and i could take as many as 27 valium in</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">a day and it would just make me a little</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">bit more normal</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">then i discovered oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">well it turns out that oxytocin and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">valium</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">both go to the gaba system the inhibitor</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:20.960" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">and then i discovered gabapentin and</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">gabapentin is</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">i take 30 things today because i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">healthy as a horse since 2005</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:32.160" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been out of bed but without the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">gabapentin if i forget my gabapentin in</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.160" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">the afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">i begin to show chronic fatigue syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:39.599" style="s2">systems are</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">symptoms within about five hours um</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.599" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">and all of this is based on dualities</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">dualities are one of the most fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">things the universe has ever existed</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">it has has ever come up with um</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:56.319" style="s2">a an electron has a</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:57.760" style="s2">negative charge or a positive i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.319" end="00:58:59.040" style="s2">remember it&#39;s mixed up</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.760" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">one of them has one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.040" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">electromagnetic charge the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">the uh proton has the other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">electromagnetic</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">charge they have opposite charges you</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.240" end="00:59:09.599" style="s2">put them together</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:10.799" style="s2">and you get all of those amazing</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.599" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">of hydrogen which were</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">utterly inconceivable on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">simply knowing what an electron is all</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">about and what a proton is all about</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">so put put opposites together and</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:29.359" style="s2">sometimes if they&#39;re the right opposites</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">you get a super size surprise</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.359" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">well i can have</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:36.160" style="s2">sadly we have come to the end of our</p>
