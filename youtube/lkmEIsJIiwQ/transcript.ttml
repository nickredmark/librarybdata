<p begin="00:00:05.009" end="00:00:08.970" style="s2">that&#39;s on the agenda to rename these and</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.049" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">figure out what we named them so we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.970" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">do a thumbnail for them but I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">say fix our world Friday met a project</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">meeting at the moment we&#39;re live for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">first time on both Facebook and YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:22.430" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see how that does for</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">technology I don&#39;t know if it uses more</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.430" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">bandwidth when that happens and there is</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">he can add himself actually if he wants</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">to or I can add him there we go so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">like crazy hair just came from at a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">meeting and haven&#39;t had ties right</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">you&#39;re looking very I&#39;d ask yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.190" end="00:00:45.300" style="s2">right good to hear I expect there to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">more brilliance with that hair that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.300" end="00:00:49.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a direct correlation it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:51.059" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s like the brain power</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.320" end="00:00:53.329" style="s2">pushes the hair out and it sticks out</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">that&#39;s my excuse for my whole life all</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.329" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">right so we&#39;re live for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:03.500" style="s2">on both Facebook and YouTube it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:05.909" style="s2">because it&#39;s post it as you on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.500" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">make sure there&#39;s I guess it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.909" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">profile picture right on the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">one so one of the things we need we</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">don&#39;t need to but could discuss today is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:16.950" style="s2">naming this meeting whatever it is and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">then I can do a thumbnail so that can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.950" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">what is because both on YouTube where</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">it&#39;s just gray and on on Facebook where</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:25.650" style="s2">it shows your picture I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">better to have one that being said I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.650" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">made one for our solution raising there</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">was the two brains and I think less</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">people click on it because it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">picture of us like they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:42.630" style="s2">know what it is and so it&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">versus the other but it could just be</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.630" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">maybe a picture of us a thumbnail and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">could use that as and then we could name</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">that whatever the thing is something</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">like the last time I don&#39;t know it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.869" end="00:01:57.540" style="s2">possibly just the way that I did the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:01:59.909" style="s2">thumbnail where it kind of looks like</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.540" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be an explanation cartoon as</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.909" end="00:02:07.069" style="s2">opposed a conversation whereas if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:12.629" style="s2">name this something much more clear than</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.069" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">solution raising then yeah then doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.629" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">the thumbnail it could be the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:17.880" style="s2">all sports not it looks more perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">slightly more professional because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.880" end="00:02:25.610" style="s2">not great at making the thumbnails but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">can do it I&#39;ve been doing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.610" end="00:02:30.420" style="s2">hopefully next week last night as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:32.430" style="s2">sure both of you realized I posted our</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.420" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">project consume wasn&#39;t posting it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.430" end="00:02:37.520" style="s2">oh sorry group thanked group projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:41.850" style="s2">and so we now have twenty members and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.520" end="00:02:44.930" style="s2">that is from no MIT nobody commenting on</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.850" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">it&#39;s about eight people liking it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.930" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">Jim not being the one to post it so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">think it will be a popular group if it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:03:02.760" style="s2">when Jim posts it or we&#39;re able to help</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:03:04.620" style="s2">the algorithm salience and what we want</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:06.989" style="s2">yes sorry badly you were gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.620" end="00:03:09.600" style="s2">something let&#39;s just say he also hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.989" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">added to the game B homepage yet but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.600" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">imagine that&#39;ll happen yes exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:19.110" style="s2">then people can see what the different</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:21.329" style="s2">project or the different groups are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.110" end="00:03:23.070" style="s2">I think projects is one that most people</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.329" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">want to join because they&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.070" end="00:03:28.200" style="s2">looking for a project that in the Soglin</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">t1 are the two and then the wiki just</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.200" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s if they want to help get</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">it if the like team together and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">information they&#39;ve also asked me to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">in an min on the game B page or men and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:40.950" style="s2">moderator utter action of the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:43.140" style="s2">between I think moderator and and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.950" end="00:03:44.940" style="s2">like oh let&#39;s try I can&#39;t really type a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.140" end="00:03:46.980" style="s2">lot during the day so I&#39;m like as long</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.940" end="00:03:48.420" style="s2">as it&#39;s not a lifelong commitment I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.980" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">pull out without getting be falling</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.420" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">apart yes I will try I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:59.160" style="s2">that had to do anything but so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">last week we had talked about having</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.160" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">instead of this kind of being a board</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">meeting and having more of a topic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:08.070" style="s2">then talking about that so that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">could come and join and so the topic we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.070" end="00:04:12.410" style="s2">had picked for this week or briefly</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:15.209" style="s2">discussed last week was poking holes in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.410" end="00:04:16.919" style="s2">omega rule was figuring out i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.209" end="00:04:19.530" style="s2">codes of conduct that we want to holder</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.919" end="00:04:22.950" style="s2">in these but that might be something we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.530" end="00:04:24.900" style="s2">want to start doing but more solidifying</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.950" end="00:04:27.750" style="s2">what this meeting looks like for when</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.900" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">people come in join what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.750" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">the rules or when they&#39;re on camera</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">versus just in the comments right like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">everyone can watch right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:40.230" style="s2">comments or not zero viewers but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:42.600" style="s2">yeah if they become a couple times or</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.230" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2">can they just watch a couple get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.600" end="00:04:48.360" style="s2">gist of it and then say yes I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:51.900" style="s2">comfortable I know what is going on and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.360" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">then Wednesday I think we&#39;re fine and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.900" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">with that rule where you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">attended in order to go I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:59.130" style="s2">start there because I&#39;m Blu&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:01.050" style="s2">get people to show up we do kind of want</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.130" end="00:05:02.280" style="s2">that to be a low bar and then over time</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.050" end="00:05:03.690" style="s2">especially if we&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.280" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">people show up that have no idea how</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.690" end="00:05:06.680" style="s2">anything works we&#39;re like all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:08.310" style="s2">let&#39;s start to talk about some</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.680" end="00:05:11.270" style="s2">requirements for what you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.310" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">done and the the level of participation</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.270" end="00:05:17.070" style="s2">the level of participation you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:18.810" style="s2">have shown in order to show up so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.070" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">guess part of it is what is our</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.810" end="00:05:26.130" style="s2">objective for this not this hour but</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:27.900" style="s2">this our ongoing right it&#39;s what from</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.130" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">what I understand it&#39;s to move the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.900" end="00:05:31.350" style="s2">matter project forward and yet not move</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:33.030" style="s2">them in a project forward right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.350" end="00:05:35.340" style="s2">not having this be a board meeting for</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.030" end="00:05:37.350" style="s2">like where&#39;s our next steps it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.340" end="00:05:39.419" style="s2">how can we bring people to a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.350" end="00:05:42.360" style="s2">where you&#39;re representing your project</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.419" end="00:05:45.450" style="s2">you&#39;re also you and then how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.360" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">discuss a topic that will generate more</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.450" end="00:05:49.830" style="s2">interest generate like you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">participate in and then from there once</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.830" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">we have more participation we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.100" style="s2">figure out the first like I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">do this is already the Menna project</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.100" end="00:06:00.270" style="s2">right media and having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:02.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the Facebook group and but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.270" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">first thing we make together right that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.100" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">might be tech related op related a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">spreadsheet related right like could be</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:13.110" style="s2">literally anything already doing those</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:14.850" style="s2">things so yes thoughts comments or do we</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.110" end="00:06:17.880" style="s2">want to start a topic and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.850" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">content so I think one thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.880" end="00:06:21.690" style="s2">believe there was talk about alternating</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:23.370" style="s2">did this meeting so we do still have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.690" end="00:06:24.690" style="s2">board meeting but I think we said it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.370" end="00:06:26.630" style="s2">probably doesn&#39;t need to be every week</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.690" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">and then every other week we alternate</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.630" end="00:06:30.900" style="s2">something else that&#39;s not board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">but is you know together tech met a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.900" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">project related</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.120" end="00:06:47.110" style="s2">yeah it looked like you were going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.940" end="00:06:49.090" style="s2">say come no I yeah I forgotten now but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.110" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">think you&#39;re right we were gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.090" end="00:06:54.250" style="s2">alternating topic I just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">remember which time was for which</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.250" end="00:06:59.169" style="s2">meetings cuz we talked about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:04.300" style="s2">different options yeah I need to write</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.169" end="00:07:07.389" style="s2">something down next time so so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.300" end="00:07:11.080" style="s2">is both of our weekly meetings are</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.389" end="00:07:13.300" style="s2">alternating so the Saturday one is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.080" end="00:07:15.550" style="s2">project raising one week solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.300" end="00:07:19.450" style="s2">raising the next and we might also be</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.550" end="00:07:21.430" style="s2">doing tiny differences right I think in</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.450" end="00:07:22.900" style="s2">a one month period having two of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.430" end="00:07:25.540" style="s2">at two o&#39;clock and two of those at nine</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.900" end="00:07:27.880" style="s2">o&#39;clock is good for our Australia and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.540" end="00:07:29.380" style="s2">New Zealand the European people can kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.880" end="00:07:33.250" style="s2">of come to either depending on which one</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.380" end="00:07:36.910" style="s2">is right of course for them but doing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.250" end="00:07:38.620" style="s2">that way and then this one&#39;s at 11:00</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.910" end="00:07:41.770" style="s2">a.m. and we&#39;re alternating between</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.620" end="00:07:42.940" style="s2">having it be a topic that people can</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.770" end="00:07:44.260" style="s2">come to and have a conversation you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.940" end="00:07:47.020" style="s2">don&#39;t need to know what&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.260" end="00:07:48.460" style="s2">the Mehta project and a board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.020" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">type how do we move them at a project</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.460" end="00:07:52.440" style="s2">forward it sounds like this meetings a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">little bit of both as we hammer that out</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.440" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">right and I think like as you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.530" style="s2">they&#39;re both both versions at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.870" style="s2">meeting that were alternated that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.530" end="00:08:04.120" style="s2">alternating between there&#39;s all them are</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.870" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">still involved with the Mehta project</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.120" end="00:08:06.970" style="s2">one of them is the board meeting how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">we want to operate and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.970" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">rules and then the other one will be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:12.580" style="s2">topics to do like what problems are we</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:14.349" style="s2">trying to solve what questions are we</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.580" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">trying to answer to do with the Mehta</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.349" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">project and you know the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:21.880" style="s2">that would that we&#39;d be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:24.310" style="s2">and like the obvious example that jumps</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.880" end="00:08:25.150" style="s2">to my mind is trust whereas they at some</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.310" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">point we want to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.150" end="00:08:28.599" style="s2">around what does it mean to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:30.910" style="s2">trust an app well what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.599" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">be able to trust like the DPP the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.910" end="00:08:39.339" style="s2">information etc topics that are more</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">they touch many of the projects exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.339" end="00:08:43.750" style="s2">one of the problems that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:45.370" style="s2">solve for projects in general which</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.750" end="00:08:47.530" style="s2">would be you know take either tack</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.370" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">reasons go or book with a wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.530" end="00:08:50.860" style="s2">all them after I sort of have that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:52.510" style="s2">concept of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.860" end="00:08:55.149" style="s2">what do we need to do for you to trust</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.510" end="00:09:02.110" style="s2">us trust us dammit</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.149" end="00:09:05.769" style="s2">that works we&#39;re done world song let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.110" end="00:09:06.490" style="s2">call it a day go to Hawaii celebrate and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.769" end="00:09:10.990" style="s2">call it a day</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.490" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">alright so do we want to actually set a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.990" end="00:09:17.800" style="s2">schedule as in for both this and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.930" style="s2">tomorrow one toros of course the project</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.800" end="00:09:21.940" style="s2">raising for Ritchie&#39;s project culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.930" end="00:09:23.769" style="s2">creation and then the week after we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.940" end="00:09:26.350" style="s2">doing I&#39;ve yet to post it in game B but</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.769" end="00:09:28.209" style="s2">the solution raising do we want that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.350" end="00:09:30.190" style="s2">solution raising to be a to or do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.209" end="00:09:31.959" style="s2">want it you already mean like do we want</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.190" end="00:09:37.899" style="s2">to two&#39;s and then to nines or you want</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.959" end="00:09:40.420" style="s2">to nine to nine I think you kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.899" end="00:09:42.519" style="s2">to like - nine - nine wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:44.709" style="s2">unless we&#39;re planning on having like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.519" end="00:09:47.560" style="s2">projects always be at nine and solutions</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.709" end="00:09:51.430" style="s2">always being at two he might go nine</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.560" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">nine two - yeah I&#39;m fine with either way</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.430" end="00:09:57.520" style="s2">like it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">might want to try it - like well one or</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.520" end="00:10:02.310" style="s2">two times before we like to think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.540" style="s2">do we want this to be a regular thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.310" end="00:10:06.910" style="s2">because if no one shows up there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.540" end="00:10:09.250" style="s2">you know there&#39;s no there&#39;s no movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.910" end="00:10:13.149" style="s2">than men but it feels like it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.250" end="00:10:14.440" style="s2">better than maybe we just mmm all - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.149" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">well part of the reason I&#39;m not having</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.440" end="00:10:20.980" style="s2">them it - is I don&#39;t want my day my two</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:22.600" style="s2">days I have off with my kid to be right</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.980" end="00:10:23.980" style="s2">in the middle but I can&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:26.829" style="s2">really before and I can&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.980" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">anything after um with my health</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.829" end="00:10:29.140" style="s2">challenges as well anyone else can</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:32.950" style="s2">figure out how to work around two</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.140" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">o&#39;clock but um so doing it twice a month</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.950" end="00:10:36.250" style="s2">is fine but I don&#39;t want to do it every</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:37.720" style="s2">Saturday at 2:00 but that also could</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.250" end="00:10:38.829" style="s2">mean that like if that is what we decide</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.720" end="00:10:42.029" style="s2">and that&#39;s what moves the project</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.829" end="00:10:45.699" style="s2">forward I just come to every other one</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.029" end="00:10:47.199" style="s2">and if full disclosure probably be the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.699" end="00:10:49.660" style="s2">solution raises because those are the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.199" end="00:10:51.430" style="s2">ones that that I enjoy I just not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">enjoy all of them it&#39;s it&#39;s really fun</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.430" end="00:10:56.589" style="s2">to see someone&#39;s project but also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:57.640" style="s2">solution raises have a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.589" end="00:10:59.260" style="s2">of my heart I love it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.640" end="00:11:04.029" style="s2">although I&#39;m really looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.260" end="00:11:04.510" style="s2">Richie&#39;s one tomorrow so do we are we</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.029" end="00:11:06.130" style="s2">going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.510" end="00:11:07.540" style="s2">just on a case-by-case basis like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.130" end="00:11:08.890" style="s2">whoever we kind of have lined up if</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.540" end="00:11:12.910" style="s2">they&#39;re australian we&#39;ll do it at 2:00</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.890" end="00:11:14.500" style="s2">and otherwise it&#39;s an eye and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.910" end="00:11:17.050" style="s2">nothing how the 2 p.m. goes and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.500" end="00:11:19.210" style="s2">adjust from there the end goal is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.050" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">to move the project forward if we try</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.210" end="00:11:22.090" style="s2">that too and you know there&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:26.620" style="s2">traction there&#39;s an argument to be made</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.090" end="00:11:32.730" style="s2">for having it a to more often all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.620" end="00:11:36.850" style="s2">I might not be able to make tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.730" end="00:11:43.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll try but something commit during</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.850" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">that time you know I believe since it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.630" end="00:11:50.080" style="s2">a to the other person we have this in</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:53.110" style="s2">that part of the hemisphere is Kylie and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.080" end="00:11:55.540" style="s2">she has a project comments trust I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.110" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">gonna butcher the name but she also</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.540" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">wants to do a project raising on that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:02.770" style="s2">and I want to do one on that too it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">really cool concept and to hers would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.770" end="00:12:06.550" style="s2">at 2 p.m. as well and she&#39;s coming to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">Ritchie&#39;s I believe tomorrow and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.550" end="00:12:15.010" style="s2">she might come to a solution racing as</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:16.470" style="s2">well cool and you you said she&#39;s it in</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.010" end="00:12:19.000" style="s2">or near the same time zone</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.470" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">she&#39;s yes she&#39;s in Australia so she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.000" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">not ridiculously waking up at 3 a.m.</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.880" end="00:12:43.540" style="s2">difference between but both ridiculously</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.210" end="00:12:48.790" style="s2">early yeah dealing with this time zone</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.540" end="00:12:53.010" style="s2">thing alright do we want to talk about</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.220" end="00:13:20.740" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.460" end="00:13:22.390" style="s2">want to do I mean maybe not I&#39;ll run it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.740" end="00:13:24.940" style="s2">by you since idea cafe is more my baby</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.390" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">but Colleen the one that is topic</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.940" end="00:13:30.130" style="s2">related idea cafe and even running it in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:32.260" style="s2">the same type of format where we for</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.130" end="00:13:34.750" style="s2">made a question or not and just have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.260" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">topic but everyone takes a brief part to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.750" end="00:13:37.570" style="s2">share in the beginning and then just</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:41.140" style="s2">have an open discussion for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.570" end="00:13:42.760" style="s2">it or is that is that resonate with you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.140" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">cuz then I feel like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.760" end="00:13:48.700" style="s2">introducing yet another concept yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:50.380" style="s2">think that&#39;s worth trying out and again</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.700" end="00:13:52.330" style="s2">you know we can see if the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.380" end="00:13:56.050" style="s2">that word is already falling around if</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.330" end="00:13:58.540" style="s2">that helps you know piggyback on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.050" end="00:13:59.800" style="s2">understanding and then this meeting is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.540" end="00:14:01.480" style="s2">still the D board meeting so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.800" end="00:14:03.850" style="s2">alternate between the board meetings and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.480" end="00:14:05.020" style="s2">the idea kept X perfect and I already</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.850" end="00:14:11.110" style="s2">have a little I already have the logo</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.020" end="00:14:13.540" style="s2">Dennis made smoke and and then yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.110" end="00:14:15.160" style="s2">just because it&#39;s just about crafting</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.540" end="00:14:17.230" style="s2">the topic into a question which helps</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.160" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">focus it anyway and hold on stabilize it</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.230" end="00:14:22.630" style="s2">like trust how do we build trust with</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:24.610" style="s2">our customers right and then we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.630" end="00:14:35.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not about having the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.610" end="00:14:41.529" style="s2">it&#39;s about having a space to share ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.080" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">off a look at meets another tag like is</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.529" end="00:14:45.339" style="s2">theirs idea cafe the channel and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.600" style="s2">it&#39;s we talk about game B every Tuesday</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.339" end="00:14:47.980" style="s2">on there but they&#39;re not we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.600" end="00:14:49.230" style="s2">talking about projects rockin what can</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.980" end="00:14:51.400" style="s2">be as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.230" end="00:14:54.010" style="s2">Facebook group from Davey in the future</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.400" end="00:14:56.709" style="s2">and anyone can come to that one this one</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.010" end="00:14:58.900" style="s2">is theoretically designed people to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.709" end="00:15:01.990" style="s2">bring their projects to and represent</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.900" end="00:15:05.020" style="s2">their project so I mean idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.990" end="00:15:09.430" style="s2">projects or Enterprise occurred for can</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.020" end="00:15:13.870" style="s2">be projects or yes that&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.430" end="00:15:22.450" style="s2">that was not just idea cafe I think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.870" end="00:15:26.050" style="s2">make sense it&#39;s very wordy but it gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.450" end="00:15:28.270" style="s2">the point across definitely you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.050" end="00:15:29.790" style="s2">more concise names but that at least it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.270" end="00:15:32.120" style="s2">gets the point across</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.790" end="00:15:35.090" style="s2">yes and then what do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.120" end="00:15:39.340" style="s2">that&#39;s good for now so what do we want</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.090" end="00:15:39.340" style="s2">to call our meta project or meeting I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.780" end="00:15:48.290" style="s2">think this is fine for now I think it</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.930" end="00:15:57.290" style="s2">won&#39;t really gather tech board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.290" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">the yeah perfect and then when we lay it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.290" end="00:16:01.540" style="s2">out like that - it&#39;ll be a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:04.220" style="s2">also people know which one to come to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.540" end="00:16:05.660" style="s2">the calendar on the Facebook site is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.220" end="00:16:07.400" style="s2">still very like I don&#39;t have to add it</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.660" end="00:16:08.690" style="s2">to the events have a new event every</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.400" end="00:16:10.340" style="s2">time because you can&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.690" end="00:16:12.650" style="s2">event with a different URL that people</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.340" end="00:16:16.430" style="s2">are going it like it&#39;s a little weird</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.650" end="00:16:18.350" style="s2">but having one calendar that does say</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.430" end="00:16:20.900" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing as it comes up and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.350" end="00:16:24.190" style="s2">people can like watch here participate</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.900" end="00:16:26.660" style="s2">here because especially if it&#39;s the UM</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.190" end="00:16:28.310" style="s2">like I there&#39;s clearly gonna be a lower</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.660" end="00:16:31.070" style="s2">I think a lower barrier for</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.310" end="00:16:34.430" style="s2">participation to the idea cafe then to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.070" end="00:16:35.630" style="s2">the board meeting right like I probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.430" end="00:16:37.910" style="s2">need to know what&#39;s going on with them</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.630" end="00:16:38.960" style="s2">to be at the board meeting you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.910" end="00:16:40.580" style="s2">necessarily need to know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.960" end="00:16:43.510" style="s2">with you can come and just have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.580" end="00:16:45.710" style="s2">project to participate in that idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.510" end="00:16:47.590" style="s2">you just maybe need to know then the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.710" end="00:16:49.940" style="s2">basic structure which is in that heart</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.590" end="00:16:56.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve been it&#39;s up to five minutes each</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.940" end="00:16:59.630" style="s2">share then open conversation so together</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.300" end="00:17:01.580" style="s2">tech board meeting thumbnail which I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.630" end="00:17:05.660" style="s2">might do with with a picture of the four</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.580" end="00:17:07.940" style="s2">of us me you like with the onus and just</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.660" end="00:17:08.990" style="s2">take it out of one of our ones on yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.940" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">won&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to take it out</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.990" end="00:17:11.540" style="s2">of one of these ones cuz I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:15.590" style="s2">access to the YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.540" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">behind the scenes um and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.590" end="00:17:18.770" style="s2">because I think it would get me out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">my idea cafe and proud of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.770" end="00:17:24.740" style="s2">which I don&#39;t know what um so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:28.010" style="s2">can take a picture a screenshot from one</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.740" end="00:17:30.050" style="s2">of those videos and just make a can be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.010" end="00:17:32.780" style="s2">placeholder for now so people can kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.050" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">of see what it looks like cuz otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.780" end="00:17:38.390" style="s2">I&#39;m working with their their thumbnails</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:39.770" style="s2">and a lot of them are like people and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.390" end="00:17:41.510" style="s2">and like things that don&#39;t really work</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.770" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">for what we&#39;re doing so I think having</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.510" end="00:17:48.110" style="s2">art for faces actually works</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:49.880" style="s2">or medians if we&#39;re close across it or</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.110" end="00:17:52.750" style="s2">whatever I&#39;ll figure it up it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.880" end="00:17:57.650" style="s2">perfect but it will be a please older</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.750" end="00:17:59.990" style="s2">and so do we want them to set what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.650" end="00:18:02.930" style="s2">next week this was kind of a board</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.990" end="00:18:10.100" style="s2">meeting mm-hmm is next week we want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.930" end="00:18:12.200" style="s2">have an idea cafe yeah sure and do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.100" end="00:18:13.370" style="s2">want to pick a topic slash question that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.200" end="00:18:20.030" style="s2">might be the easiest or we can pick</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">three and then send it to vote I&#39;m fine</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.030" end="00:18:23.960" style="s2">either way</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:29.540" style="s2">so it&#39;s about three that we think are</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.960" end="00:18:31.910" style="s2">promising I think there is also because</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.540" end="00:18:34.430" style="s2">we&#39;re already asking the three questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.910" end="00:18:36.620" style="s2">for the solution raising I wonder if we</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.430" end="00:18:38.360" style="s2">just want to pick it for the first one</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.620" end="00:18:40.370" style="s2">or two and then wait until we start</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.360" end="00:18:41.810" style="s2">getting an audience in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.370" end="00:18:43.940" style="s2">channel and then start posting questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.810" end="00:18:45.860" style="s2">there once we actually have like people</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.940" end="00:18:52.340" style="s2">interacting and more members and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.860" end="00:18:54.050" style="s2">kind of thing so how do we want to I</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.340" end="00:18:57.380" style="s2">think Trust is trust resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.050" end="00:18:59.660" style="s2">everyone as something that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.380" end="00:19:01.430" style="s2">be top of my list so I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.660" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the same for everyone else but so</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.430" end="00:19:04.610" style="s2">then we just need to craft it into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:08.420" style="s2">type of question that anyone can answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.610" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">which is just right I think how can we</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.420" end="00:19:16.340" style="s2">get strangers to trust us in our</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:19.550" style="s2">projects I was thinking like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.340" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">need to trust an organization or</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.550" end="00:19:22.730" style="s2">something like that where it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:26.390" style="s2">protect because I can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.730" end="00:19:27.770" style="s2">answer what people need to trust you</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.390" end="00:19:29.540" style="s2">know quickly election or reason score</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.770" end="00:19:31.940" style="s2">but I can say what I need in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.540" end="00:19:35.420" style="s2">trust you know Google or wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.940" end="00:19:38.900" style="s2">or anything else yeah no I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.420" end="00:19:41.240" style="s2">an important because it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.900" end="00:19:43.010" style="s2">answer is the individual like you I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.240" end="00:19:45.260" style="s2">this I also have an opinion of what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.010" end="00:19:48.200" style="s2">would trust in entres I clearly admit a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.260" end="00:19:49.640" style="s2">trust wiki lection and reasons for more</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.200" end="00:19:52.130" style="s2">than a random other one because I know</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.640" end="00:19:54.860" style="s2">the two of you right and so that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.130" end="00:19:56.270" style="s2">different than it&#39;s like but yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.860" end="00:19:57.590" style="s2">how that is my that&#39;s right I need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.270" end="00:19:59.530" style="s2">know the person and have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.590" end="00:20:02.440" style="s2">with them to trust better</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.530" end="00:20:04.360" style="s2">their app right yeah I feel for the kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.440" end="00:20:04.630" style="s2">of person they are but it comes into</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.360" end="00:20:07.000" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.630" end="00:20:09.820" style="s2">yeah so what do you need to trust what</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.000" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">do you need to trust an organization is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.820" end="00:20:12.550" style="s2">that it clear enough when we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:15.610" style="s2">have this conversation maybe what do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.550" end="00:20:19.690" style="s2">need what do you need what if it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.610" end="00:20:23.680" style="s2">what what builds your trust an</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.690" end="00:20:28.150" style="s2">organization what what do you need in</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.680" end="00:20:29.910" style="s2">place to trust an organization and do</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.150" end="00:20:35.170" style="s2">wanna say it&#39;s like four new</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.910" end="00:20:36.730" style="s2">organizations or do it I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.170" end="00:20:38.950" style="s2">it is for it to be as broad as possible</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.730" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">so like you know we&#39;ll probably start</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.950" end="00:20:42.700" style="s2">out with maybe some examples of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:45.130" style="s2">well here&#39;s what caused me to lose trust</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.700" end="00:20:47.980" style="s2">in organization so the opposite of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.130" end="00:20:50.530" style="s2">and then what okay on top of that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.980" end="00:20:52.330" style="s2">things we haven&#39;t seen like for me I</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.530" end="00:20:54.010" style="s2">have a lot of questions up because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.330" end="00:20:56.590" style="s2">not just what do you need in order to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.010" end="00:20:58.360" style="s2">trust in organization what I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.590" end="00:21:00.220" style="s2">of us are getting at is what do you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.360" end="00:21:02.050" style="s2">both to trust the outcome and to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.220" end="00:21:04.210" style="s2">willing to contribute both your time and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.050" end="00:21:06.490" style="s2">or like actually you know some money on</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.210" end="00:21:07.960" style="s2">patreon or Kickstarter or whatever what</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.490" end="00:21:10.090" style="s2">do you need to see what questions do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.960" end="00:21:14.430" style="s2">have what makes you go from there to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.090" end="00:21:17.140" style="s2">like okay I&#39;ll support that and so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.430" end="00:21:18.850" style="s2">because this is also our first one do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.140" end="00:21:20.530" style="s2">want to focus that do we want to pick</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.850" end="00:21:23.410" style="s2">because that&#39;s gonna be all very</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.530" end="00:21:25.090" style="s2">different right who do I trust to fund</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.410" end="00:21:27.520" style="s2">their project who do I trust to use</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.090" end="00:21:30.010" style="s2">their product once it&#39;s in existence who</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.520" end="00:21:32.740" style="s2">do I trust to be part of creating their</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.010" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">project my time and once it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.740" end="00:21:35.860" style="s2">out there and I have no involvement in</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:38.920" style="s2">it but I want to be just a customer</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.860" end="00:21:40.360" style="s2">right what I do I yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.920" end="00:21:41.140" style="s2">it&#39;s good to start broad and just say</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.360" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">what do you need to trust the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.140" end="00:21:44.470" style="s2">organization and then people can say</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.450" style="s2">what that means to them somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.470" end="00:21:48.220" style="s2">might say like here&#39;s what you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.450" end="00:21:49.450" style="s2">Google could do to make me trust them</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.220" end="00:21:51.700" style="s2">and then somebody else can say well a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.450" end="00:21:53.020" style="s2">brand new organization here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.700" end="00:21:55.330" style="s2">would need this trust that organization</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.020" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">I think that is generally how I word it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.330" end="00:21:59.080" style="s2">is it&#39;s not a you it&#39;s an AI so what do</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.690" end="00:24:00.690" style="s2">that into place using omega rule and yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.630" end="00:24:03.030" style="s2">not using omega roll right so yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.690" end="00:24:04.410" style="s2">this start or the answer that is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.030" end="00:24:06.150" style="s2">the purpose of these session if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.410" end="00:24:08.940" style="s2">don&#39;t want to poke holes don&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.150" end="00:24:10.410" style="s2">your project a project raising if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.940" end="00:24:12.420" style="s2">just want people to say good things</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.410" end="00:24:15.090" style="s2">about your project you have a mirror at</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.420" end="00:24:16.830" style="s2">home like go handle that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:19.680" style="s2">trying to build it and move forward and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.830" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">they said like that in my mind like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.680" end="00:24:22.590" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t attend something that someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:24.840" style="s2">is like I don&#39;t want any negative</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.590" end="00:24:26.070" style="s2">feedback or constructive criticism just</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.840" end="00:24:28.290" style="s2">tell me good things</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.070" end="00:24:31.380" style="s2">like that&#39;s cool that&#39;s fine that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.290" end="00:24:32.700" style="s2">want that I&#39;ll pass I feel like I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.380" end="00:24:34.560" style="s2">really cool if someone came and said</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.700" end="00:24:36.750" style="s2">that I would then know the rule and be</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.560" end="00:24:38.820" style="s2">like okay I can do that the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.750" end="00:24:40.500" style="s2">when people feel bad and in no way</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.820" end="00:24:45.270" style="s2">communicate that and then you&#39;re poking</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.500" end="00:24:47.460" style="s2">holes in it and it&#39;s going like what not</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.270" end="00:24:49.860" style="s2">poking why I mean even when we first</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.460" end="00:24:51.690" style="s2">introduced project raising it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.860" end="00:24:53.100" style="s2">actually under it was like well practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.690" end="00:24:55.500" style="s2">Omega rule will tell you about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.100" end="00:24:58.050" style="s2">beauty of your project and then we you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.500" end="00:25:00.060" style="s2">say the aspirations right if you&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.050" end="00:25:01.950" style="s2">of your aspirations or clearly things we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.060" end="00:25:03.810" style="s2">need to pull holes in then we almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.950" end="00:25:05.940" style="s2">have like we can&#39;t meet that aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.810" end="00:25:09.030" style="s2">without doing that but if the aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.940" end="00:25:11.460" style="s2">is help me find the value in this then</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.030" end="00:25:12.570" style="s2">we&#39;re not finding the opposite right</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.460" end="00:25:16.650" style="s2">we&#39;re not finding the holes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.570" end="00:25:18.990" style="s2">finding the value but I want permission</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.650" end="00:25:19.770" style="s2">to poke holes like I want to be them to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.990" end="00:25:23.040" style="s2">be like yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.770" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">anything goes I don&#39;t want to have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.040" end="00:25:27.660" style="s2">guess as a participant right I want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:28.620" style="s2">know what the level is that you want</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.660" end="00:25:31.950" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.620" end="00:25:33.450" style="s2">yeah well poked in and holes I want you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.950" end="00:25:35.340" style="s2">to see anything yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.450" end="00:25:36.930" style="s2">we almost provide like a menu of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.340" end="00:25:39.720" style="s2">here&#39;s the kind of feedback we can offer</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.930" end="00:25:40.740" style="s2">pick which ones as opposed to like only</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.720" end="00:25:42.330" style="s2">good things I only want positive</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.740" end="00:25:44.130" style="s2">feedback and for you to say that my idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.330" end="00:25:46.800" style="s2">is great there&#39;s multiple ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.130" end="00:25:48.120" style="s2">can frame feedback like instead of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.800" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2">saying that won&#39;t work saying have you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.120" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">thought about this it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:52.920" style="s2">poking a hole but it still kind of is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:54.930" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like how do you want that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.920" end="00:25:57.750" style="s2">frame I guess I&#39;m just trying to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.930" end="00:26:00.110" style="s2">the I only want good things just tell me</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.750" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">my ideas great and that I can keep going</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.110" end="00:26:10.170" style="s2">well there&#39;s there&#39;s times in a project</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:13.850" style="s2">where it&#39;s not of much value to point</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.170" end="00:26:18.840" style="s2">out all the potential problems but to</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.850" end="00:26:22.230" style="s2">try and add you know depth to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.840" end="00:26:24.900" style="s2">or or something in that value and I also</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.230" end="00:26:28.170" style="s2">sometimes find it&#39;s counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.900" end="00:26:31.500" style="s2">when people talk about Edra when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.170" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">said have you thought about this now</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.500" end="00:26:35.370" style="s2">that a lot of that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:36.930" style="s2">but everyone small it&#39;s like Oh have you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.370" end="00:26:39.790" style="s2">thought about doing this it&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.930" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">the same area of your project</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.790" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">but completely unrelated to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:47.460" style="s2">doing and it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:49.810" style="s2">idea but it&#39;s not what I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.460" end="00:26:52.450" style="s2">right yeah I think all the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.810" end="00:26:54.250" style="s2">should be going back to what they want</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.450" end="00:26:56.170" style="s2">to get out of it and so like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.250" end="00:26:57.910" style="s2">trying to get you know I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.170" end="00:26:59.560" style="s2">funding okay great so we&#39;ll keep that in</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.910" end="00:27:01.300" style="s2">mind and you say okay well there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.560" end="00:27:02.590" style="s2">thing you might be able to do that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.300" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2">really what you&#39;re doing but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.590" end="00:27:07.990" style="s2">parallel or analogous or close enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:09.670" style="s2">and might help funding so but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.990" end="00:27:12.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that if that wasn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.670" end="00:27:13.690" style="s2">they want so maybe if we do keep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.160" end="00:27:15.940" style="s2">the concept of asking what are your</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.690" end="00:27:19.030" style="s2">aspirations or what do you want out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.940" end="00:27:23.410" style="s2">this and have them mention that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.030" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">should probably say I want critical</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.410" end="00:27:29.740" style="s2">feedback as one of those things on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:33.100" style="s2">idea or if I just want a brainstorm how</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.740" end="00:27:37.180" style="s2">to meet this goal you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.100" end="00:27:41.050" style="s2">closer to a solution raising than a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.180" end="00:27:44.590" style="s2">project right raising well they might</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.050" end="00:27:47.080" style="s2">have a germ of an idea or if started and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.590" end="00:27:50.280" style="s2">that way we can kind of get a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.080" end="00:27:52.540" style="s2">and maybe propose a couple of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.280" end="00:27:59.350" style="s2">aspirations for people to choose from</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.540" end="00:28:01.300" style="s2">right because I&#39;m part of what is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.350" end="00:28:03.460" style="s2">issue I find when I&#39;m when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.300" end="00:28:05.110" style="s2">interacting with somebody on my idea I</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.460" end="00:28:06.550" style="s2">don&#39;t have a problem with them poking</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.110" end="00:28:07.690" style="s2">holes in it at all I want to have an</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.550" end="00:28:10.600" style="s2">hour-long conversation where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.690" end="00:28:12.700" style="s2">poking holes in it the issue is if every</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.600" end="00:28:14.590" style="s2">conversation is always that then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.700" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">poking the same holes in it again and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.590" end="00:28:17.470" style="s2">again and again and it&#39;s like I&#39;ve dealt</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">with it yes I&#39;ve thought of that yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.470" end="00:28:22.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve done and so part of it is like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.950" style="s2">not don&#39;t poke holes it&#39;s like yes I get</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.660" end="00:28:25.810" style="s2">that I guess that&#39;s a problem we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.950" end="00:28:27.160" style="s2">figure that out later or I have figured</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.810" end="00:28:29.890" style="s2">it out but I&#39;m not getting into that oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.160" end="00:28:31.630" style="s2">and part of this is for the project</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.890" end="00:28:32.590" style="s2">raising right when someone brings their</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.630" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">project they can give us their</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.590" end="00:28:38.980" style="s2">aspirations but part of this is also for</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:42.280" style="s2">the Facebook group what are what is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.980" end="00:28:43.510" style="s2">code of conduct life of like posting in</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.280" end="00:28:48.100" style="s2">there about your project</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.510" end="00:28:50.200" style="s2">I think yay but with that there how much</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.100" end="00:28:52.330" style="s2">will be poking holes in it and what kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.200" end="00:28:53.860" style="s2">of holes right like the community rules</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.330" end="00:28:56.770" style="s2">for if I post a ball</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.860" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">Wiki election in game b projects the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.770" end="00:28:59.950" style="s2">kinds of comments that were wanting like</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:02.350" style="s2">what is allowed what isn&#39;t allowed</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.950" end="00:29:03.490" style="s2">what&#39;s the point what&#39;s like not even</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.350" end="00:29:05.080" style="s2">necessary the rules remember was</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.490" end="00:29:08.580" style="s2">involved but like what do we actively</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.080" end="00:29:12.309" style="s2">want what kind of feedback do we want</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.580" end="00:29:16.210" style="s2">that yeah because I mean the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.309" end="00:29:18.280" style="s2">group itself isn&#39;t really the place to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.210" end="00:29:19.750" style="s2">get every like every poked a hole and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.280" end="00:29:21.309" style="s2">then fix the hole and poke like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.750" end="00:29:25.000" style="s2">just not designed for that type of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.309" end="00:29:26.500" style="s2">conversation right it&#39;s even like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.000" end="00:29:29.140" style="s2">Facebook Messenger is hard to do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.500" end="00:29:30.340" style="s2">have that that manually and then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.140" end="00:29:31.390" style="s2">ones with more holes you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.340" end="00:29:33.610" style="s2">the algorithm it&#39;s gonna be higher</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.390" end="00:29:34.990" style="s2">anyway and it&#39;s like how often is wiki</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.610" end="00:29:36.700" style="s2">election yet like I think that if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.990" end="00:29:39.070" style="s2">have a problem and you want help right</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.700" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">and say hey theoretically hopefully we</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.070" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">know what wiki election is right already</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:44.770" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like this is the thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">dealing with and posting that sound</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.770" end="00:29:49.059" style="s2">screen then we can help you cuz you gots</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:52.450" style="s2">an actual question or you post what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.059" end="00:29:54.790" style="s2">wiki lection and then you put the call</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.450" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">out for what you want right like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.790" end="00:29:58.210" style="s2">posting my ideas I actually don&#39;t I want</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">people to comment some of the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.210" end="00:30:02.169" style="s2">to be increased but I don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:04.120" style="s2">the conversation there because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.169" end="00:30:06.910" style="s2">find it useful I want to have an actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.120" end="00:30:08.650" style="s2">conversation I think the conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.910" end="00:30:11.110" style="s2">the group should be trying to arrange</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.650" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">these kinds of meetings where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.110" end="00:30:14.919" style="s2">we all projects what goal were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:16.510" style="s2">solve over three are trying to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.919" end="00:30:19.240" style="s2">same thing right let&#39;s set up some kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.510" end="00:30:20.740" style="s2">of a live stream or arrange some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.240" end="00:30:22.900" style="s2">a more in-depth conversation that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.740" end="00:30:25.620" style="s2">through facebook comments because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.900" end="00:30:25.620" style="s2">not very useful</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.510" end="00:30:34.750" style="s2">yeah but this is all kind of making me</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.870" end="00:30:38.020" style="s2">think back through the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.750" end="00:30:40.429" style="s2">conversations just like you to where</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.020" end="00:30:44.030" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to explain the project and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.429" end="00:30:46.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a very frustrating experience some</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.030" end="00:30:48.770" style="s2">of that is because it takes a while for</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.340" end="00:30:52.160" style="s2">us to learn how to express it away but</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.770" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">also a lot of people do too like I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.160" end="00:30:57.410" style="s2">imagine Adria when when you do your idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:59.960" style="s2">and someone comes and says oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.410" end="00:31:04.190" style="s2">never going to stop all misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.960" end="00:31:08.090" style="s2">and you&#39;re like well okay yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.190" end="00:31:11.770" style="s2">do miracles but it will make the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.090" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">better right yeah I don&#39;t like to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.770" end="00:31:16.610" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s just have a blanket</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:19.370" style="s2">understanding that no one&#39;s project is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.610" end="00:31:22.940" style="s2">going to be perfect and has to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.370" end="00:31:24.740" style="s2">problem a hundred percent yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.940" end="00:31:26.870" style="s2">it&#39;s very reasonable to make a list of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.740" end="00:31:28.370" style="s2">feedback that&#39;s not useful like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.870" end="00:31:31.640" style="s2">not a perfect solution that is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.370" end="00:31:34.280" style="s2">useful feedback yeah so I think it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.640" end="00:31:38.120" style="s2">good to make a little guidebook of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.280" end="00:31:39.799" style="s2">and also not like Jubilee was saying you</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.120" end="00:31:42.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have to have a solution to every</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.799" end="00:31:44.270" style="s2">potential I mean a lot of people seem to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.500" end="00:31:45.650" style="s2">be just like here&#39;s the wall you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.270" end="00:31:46.760" style="s2">gonna have to climb over here&#39;s a wall</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.650" end="00:31:50.090" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to climb over and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.760" end="00:31:53.240" style="s2">like yeah I mean I&#39;ve seen that wall but</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.090" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">I&#39;m not a every mention of the wall they</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.240" end="00:31:58.549" style="s2">phrase it like that&#39;s a reason not to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">it right like this is going to stop you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.549" end="00:32:04.190" style="s2">as opposed have you thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:05.900" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah so yeah I&#39;m working it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.190" end="00:32:10.520" style="s2">be interesting to work up a document a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.900" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">short document on hear some feedback</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.520" end="00:32:16.850" style="s2">that&#39;s not generally useful and how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">write re you know get that same idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.850" end="00:32:21.799" style="s2">across like a tree like you said do we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:25.220" style="s2">consider this yet right I think that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.799" end="00:32:26.750" style="s2">will end up being from a living document</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.220" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">where as we&#39;re going through this for</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.750" end="00:32:30.799" style="s2">various projects a we&#39;re gonna end up</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:32.750" style="s2">identifying kind of stages where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.799" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">like okay so your project is in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.750" end="00:32:36.350" style="s2">stage based on the kinds of content and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">the you know your capability to explain</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.350" end="00:32:40.280" style="s2">it like if you&#39;re having problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:42.169" style="s2">explaining your project okay then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.280" end="00:32:42.600" style="s2">not at this stage yet you&#39;re here or</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.169" end="00:32:44.460" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.600" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">because in order for you to be you know</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.910" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">a catalog of here&#39;s the things people</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.520" end="00:33:06.780" style="s2">have asked and here&#39;s the common answers</p>

<p begin="00:33:26.270" end="00:33:34.620" style="s2">and I think the more structure the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.370" end="00:33:36.539" style="s2">person posting for feedback gives the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.620" end="00:33:38.970" style="s2">better like like how we help them set</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.830" end="00:34:26.909" style="s2">obviously it may end up being just like</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.869" end="00:34:28.500" style="s2">we&#39;ll have a catalog of like who knows</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.909" end="00:34:30.179" style="s2">what so if we&#39;re saying oh you want a</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.510" end="00:34:39.570" style="s2">levels and here&#39;s the kinds of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:40.440" style="s2">that they tend to give like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.570" end="00:34:42.270" style="s2">person&#39;s a whole poker</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.440" end="00:34:43.109" style="s2">you don&#39;t want whole spoke don&#39;t talk to</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.270" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">them because that&#39;s what they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.109" end="00:34:49.350" style="s2">do that&#39;s their skill set yeah I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:51.089" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to not do you want all</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.350" end="00:34:54.570" style="s2">the things that are wrong with it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.089" end="00:34:55.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what I want to do it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.570" end="00:34:58.770" style="s2">is this skill set if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.950" end="00:35:01.859" style="s2">that horrible if you don&#39;t and there</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.770" end="00:35:04.680" style="s2">might be a good questionnaire also</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.859" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">before we do and maybe this is good for</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.680" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">the project raising at some point is</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:14.760" style="s2">like what are some common feedback that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:16.740" style="s2">you get that you have answers to and do</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.760" end="00:35:18.869" style="s2">you want to take a little bit of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.740" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">time upfront to cover that or do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.869" end="00:35:24.570" style="s2">want to just know that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:26.430" style="s2">thought it&#39;ll be solved in the future</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.570" end="00:35:28.500" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the focus of this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.430" end="00:35:30.540" style="s2">right and then also what happens if we</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.500" end="00:35:32.280" style="s2">have they&#39;re like here&#39;s the questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.540" end="00:35:33.390" style="s2">and here&#39;s the answers and we read it</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.280" end="00:35:36.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re like that doesn&#39;t answer that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.390" end="00:35:38.820" style="s2">question is that&#39;s very flexible realize</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:40.740" style="s2">yeah really get the explanation like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.820" end="00:35:42.089" style="s2">where it&#39;s almost challenging that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.740" end="00:35:44.070" style="s2">their stage for like much better term</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.089" end="00:35:45.630" style="s2">like you think you have this sorted we</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.070" end="00:35:47.970" style="s2">all read it and none of us understand it</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.630" end="00:35:51.510" style="s2">yeah so maybe whether they want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.970" end="00:35:54.060" style="s2">explore that right now because they may</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.510" end="00:35:56.250" style="s2">know their answers not great right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.060" end="00:35:58.619" style="s2">I think the other part to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.250" end="00:36:00.060" style="s2">is that this isn&#39;t just about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.619" end="00:36:03.270" style="s2">project that&#39;s coming on this is also</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.060" end="00:36:04.950" style="s2">about our you know the the the together</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.270" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">tech journey of figuring out what does</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.950" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">it take to assess a project to be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:09.960" style="s2">to sort of structure them to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:11.640" style="s2">set up what are the stages like be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.960" end="00:36:14.369" style="s2">to test it up what kind of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.640" end="00:36:15.420" style="s2">actually leads to useful learnings if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.369" end="00:36:18.270" style="s2">go through five of them or like you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.420" end="00:36:21.270" style="s2">what poking holes works like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.270" end="00:36:22.470" style="s2">given us our best stuff why are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.270" end="00:36:24.180" style="s2">this if we&#39;re not trying to move things</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.470" end="00:36:25.740" style="s2">forward and you might end up with here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.180" end="00:36:26.940" style="s2">the kinds of feedback if you really</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.740" end="00:36:28.470" style="s2">don&#39;t want this okay here&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.940" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">options but they aren&#39;t as good in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.470" end="00:36:33.060" style="s2">explanation you want those either okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:34.349" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the session for you because</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.060" end="00:36:36.510" style="s2">here&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.349" end="00:36:38.970" style="s2">this session as well it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.510" end="00:36:42.089" style="s2">what the project wants out of it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.970" end="00:36:43.619" style="s2">trying to work we can quite possibly not</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.089" end="00:36:45.690" style="s2">necessarily the three of us but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.619" end="00:36:48.030" style="s2">bigger group as a whole have different</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.690" end="00:36:50.220" style="s2">types of sessions that are like this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.030" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">a project raising when you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.220" end="00:36:53.400" style="s2">for funding this is a project raising</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:55.020" style="s2">for marketing and this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.400" end="00:36:57.480" style="s2">beginning and you just had the problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.020" end="00:36:59.250" style="s2">and you it&#39;s your baby solution because</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.480" end="00:37:00.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like very helpful actually to poke</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.250" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">holes in the baby solution because</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.839" end="00:37:04.950" style="s2">nothing&#39;s been done yet and so like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:07.500" style="s2">both helpful and not helpful depending</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.950" end="00:37:08.750" style="s2">on the person whereas hey this is my app</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.500" end="00:37:12.530" style="s2">that I&#39;m releasing it to more</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.750" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">and your leg did you think about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.530" end="00:37:16.610" style="s2">care if it breaks it let&#39;s just release</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:19.390" style="s2">it because the the works been done the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.610" end="00:37:21.620" style="s2">money&#39;s there right like cubes spa needs</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.390" end="00:37:23.630" style="s2">$250,000 to move forward saying don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.620" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">start isn&#39;t an option right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.630" end="00:37:29.120" style="s2">like you&#39;ve already put in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:31.100" style="s2">time and yet I know I&#39;m getting consent</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.120" end="00:37:33.470" style="s2">and stuff all the time it&#39;s like no stop</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.100" end="00:37:36.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve put in all of your family&#39;s money</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.470" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">and this is not a profit project and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.500" end="00:37:41.930" style="s2">it&#39;s up to that person to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:42.770" style="s2">listen listen or not and and decide is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.930" end="00:37:45.500" style="s2">this worth the risk</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.770" end="00:37:48.650" style="s2">right it&#39;s different because we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.500" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">are attempting game B so it&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.650" end="00:37:54.590" style="s2">the case of cubes bond it might not be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:59.060" style="s2">financially lucrative for James to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.590" end="00:38:01.400" style="s2">continue for the planet and society I</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.060" end="00:38:04.250" style="s2">really want him to continue right right</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.400" end="00:38:05.870" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like how and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.250" end="00:38:08.810" style="s2">like the Better Project how do we fund</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.870" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">things how do we get people&#39;s projects</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.810" end="00:38:12.590" style="s2">made that have huge impact that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">necessarily that need more funding or</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.590" end="00:38:16.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have the story figured out don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.540" end="00:38:18.380" style="s2">have the media piece right that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.790" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not the charismatic leader that</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.520" end="00:38:32.840" style="s2">interesting to have a YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.540" end="00:38:34.550" style="s2">that features these projects so they</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.840" end="00:38:36.980" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.550" end="00:38:39.770" style="s2">which is kind of what we&#39;re doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.980" end="00:38:41.390" style="s2">they can take it a step further and you</p>

<p begin="00:41:51.190" end="00:41:56.470" style="s2">YouTube channel at the time yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.070" end="00:41:56.980" style="s2">that person comes about that would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.470" end="00:41:58.900" style="s2">awesome</p>

<p begin="00:42:06.730" end="00:42:10.060" style="s2">whether they understand cuz like they</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.500" end="00:42:12.339" style="s2">have to get the information and and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.060" end="00:42:14.050" style="s2">do that for now it makes more sense to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.339" end="00:42:16.300" style="s2">have the person with the project do it</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.810" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">part of kind of at least my vision of</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.329" end="00:42:30.220" style="s2">together tech is like right now under</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:31.810" style="s2">game a you have to be everything for</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.220" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">your project be the spokesperson you</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.810" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">have to be perfect you have to edits</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:38.230" style="s2">like that is broken in and of itself you</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:39.910" style="s2">know I mean like James Jones is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.230" end="00:42:41.800" style="s2">at the engineering stuff I want that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.910" end="00:42:43.540" style="s2">project to exist he might not be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.800" end="00:42:45.310" style="s2">best at being the person to go into</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.540" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">medians and get funding or to go into</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.310" end="00:42:49.900" style="s2">meetings you know like and yet he should</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">absolutely be the person doing what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.900" end="00:42:54.520" style="s2">doing and I&#39;m the same way for my stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:56.260" style="s2">like I can think this in my sleep I</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.520" end="00:42:58.900" style="s2">could come up with tech ideas that can</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.260" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">change the world I can&#39;t make them and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.900" end="00:43:02.020" style="s2">can&#39;t even communicate them and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:04.150" style="s2">broken look it&#39;s like that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.020" end="00:43:05.710" style="s2">you can&#39;t have an idea and not be able</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.150" end="00:43:07.510" style="s2">to communicate it and hope it gets into</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.710" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">the world but I&#39;m figuring that P so</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.510" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">like showcasing that journey as well of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:13.810" style="s2">like right even if you can&#39;t communicate</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:15.310" style="s2">and communicate it for now until someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.810" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">comes on board and wants to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.310" end="00:43:19.000" style="s2">yours and we can do that and we find the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:20.770" style="s2">holes right someone needs marketing for</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.000" end="00:43:22.089" style="s2">this someone needs this and it&#39;s finding</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.770" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">the people who&#39;re the projects in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.089" end="00:43:27.490" style="s2">projects with the people it right I</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:29.500" style="s2">think one of my goals for together Tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.490" end="00:43:31.839" style="s2">and the Amanar project is to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.500" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">have that library of like here&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.839" end="00:43:35.140" style="s2">that did you know each project is trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:36.940" style="s2">or some of the projects are trying right</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.140" end="00:43:38.890" style="s2">so some of them might be Oh some of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.940" end="00:43:40.599" style="s2">are trying doing project raises some of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.890" end="00:43:42.369" style="s2">them are trying this monthly updated</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.369" end="00:43:46.300" style="s2">then you can see who&#39;s trying it you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.740" end="00:43:47.740" style="s2">see the content and you can sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.300" end="00:43:49.210" style="s2">their feedback on you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.740" end="00:43:51.160" style="s2">they think it helps if it&#39;s easy to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.210" end="00:43:53.080" style="s2">how much time is taking them how many</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.160" end="00:43:54.400" style="s2">views it gets like whatever kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.080" end="00:43:57.010" style="s2">things we want to track to see if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">working but in my mind that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.010" end="00:44:00.910" style="s2">things that together Tech can give to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">projects is that library of like here</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.910" end="00:44:06.010" style="s2">are some ideas that you know the various</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:07.630" style="s2">project owners have started doing and</p>

<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:35.160" style="s2">figure out a project like hey we did a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.880" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">Facebook group right I think at least</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.160" end="00:47:38.670" style="s2">for the first while it&#39;s better if</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:40.710" style="s2">everyone is kind of doing their own spin</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.670" end="00:47:43.559" style="s2">because then we start to get an idea of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.710" end="00:47:45.269" style="s2">okay people love Bentley&#39;s updates what</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.559" end="00:47:47.940" style="s2">is he doing what&#39;s unique about his</p>

<p begin="00:47:47.940" end="00:47:51.329" style="s2">then the runs the Adriel does no one</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.559" end="00:47:53.880" style="s2">cares even though people like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.329" end="00:47:55.950" style="s2">project like you start to learn what</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.880" end="00:47:58.769" style="s2">works and what doesn&#39;t and then every</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.950" end="00:48:01.799" style="s2">time you post do you like okay let&#39;s do</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.180" end="00:48:09.539" style="s2">here&#39;s alternate ideas that people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.650" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">trying just some general like if this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.539" end="00:48:13.740" style="s2">the first when you&#39;re doing go read this</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.119" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">other things are like just random things</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:30.540" style="s2">you can try if you want yeah like if I</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:33.030" style="s2">can do I&#39;ll do it</p>

<p begin="00:49:27.390" end="00:49:33.030" style="s2">alternate through us because yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.630" end="00:49:35.340" style="s2">like together tech might also be a good</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.030" end="00:49:37.350" style="s2">example of a more complex project as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.340" end="00:49:39.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a project about projects and B</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.350" end="00:49:41.010" style="s2">there&#39;s already more of us like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.480" end="00:49:42.900" style="s2">something unique about it I think a lot</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.140" end="00:49:52.740" style="s2">which I don&#39;t think many others do and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.150" end="00:49:54.660" style="s2">so it&#39;s we actually have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.740" end="00:49:57.810" style="s2">say like it&#39;s off all three of us or</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.660" end="00:50:00.119" style="s2">four of us and who you know whoever else</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.810" end="00:50:01.770" style="s2">joins then we can start to say like oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.119" end="00:50:03.180" style="s2">here&#39;s what we&#39;re trying for multi</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.770" end="00:50:05.730" style="s2">people projects and that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.180" end="00:50:07.170" style="s2">probably a later stage or like one of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.730" end="00:50:09.350" style="s2">the things to track on a project is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.170" end="00:50:12.090" style="s2">there&#39;s more than one project owner</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.350" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">here&#39;s how we&#39;re handling that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.090" end="00:50:18.390" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s true so um can we do a</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:20.040" style="s2">guideline I mean we have like 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.390" end="00:50:23.340" style="s2">left a guideline of what we want and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.040" end="00:50:24.930" style="s2">those updated it knows monthly we just</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.340" end="00:50:25.750" style="s2">do our own first because if we&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.930" end="00:50:28.120" style="s2">we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.750" end="00:50:30.610" style="s2">just doing our own I think the only</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.120" end="00:50:32.680" style="s2">guideline is under five minutes under</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.610" end="00:50:34.810" style="s2">five minutes and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.680" end="00:50:36.760" style="s2">preferably under - but like definitely</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.810" end="00:50:38.410" style="s2">under five I guess like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.760" end="00:50:40.720" style="s2">covering in that is it literally</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.410" end="00:50:43.090" style="s2">anything or is it like hey I explained</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:45.300" style="s2">Enix we&#39;ve never explained like because</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.090" end="00:50:48.070" style="s2">I actually did and it wasn&#39;t nobody</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.300" end="00:50:50.740" style="s2">caught I can even delete it we could do</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.070" end="00:50:52.540" style="s2">a new one but like what is your project</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.740" end="00:50:53.560" style="s2">and I have listed a few things it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.540" end="00:50:55.360" style="s2">like what&#39;s your name what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.560" end="00:50:56.680" style="s2">project where&#39;s the link outside and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.360" end="00:50:59.110" style="s2">nobody answered I might have been too</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.680" end="00:51:01.480" style="s2">much stuff but like hey if we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.110" end="00:51:03.850" style="s2">upload an explainer video not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.480" end="00:51:07.360" style="s2">professional one you&#39;ll see you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.850" end="00:51:11.230" style="s2">like it&#39;s like this level of hey what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.360" end="00:51:13.750" style="s2">together tech what is idea cafe right um</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.230" end="00:51:15.490" style="s2">which is because that&#39;s not it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.750" end="00:51:17.380" style="s2">where were ass but you kind of need that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.490" end="00:51:18.550" style="s2">to get to the where we&#39;re at right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.380" end="00:51:21.190" style="s2">then it&#39;s like and then the next one is</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.460" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">having that be everyone because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.630" end="00:51:37.450" style="s2">that&#39;s too much but we&#39;ll all spread out</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.940" style="s2">with okay you start out with your</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.450" end="00:51:41.950" style="s2">elevator pitch and then you go into like</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.940" end="00:51:43.540" style="s2">where your project is at you the first</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.950" end="00:51:46.570" style="s2">one will probably just be aware that</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.540" end="00:51:48.940" style="s2">right now and then future ones are let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.570" end="00:51:50.680" style="s2">move since the last update and you&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.680" end="00:51:55.150" style="s2">at now like if there&#39;s any you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.380" end="00:51:58.270" style="s2">thing that might bridge multiple videos</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.150" end="00:52:01.300" style="s2">and sort of current projects are like</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.270" end="00:52:03.370" style="s2">curtain yeah a project within the front</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.300" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">a task I guess is a better would say</p>

<p begin="00:52:28.900" end="00:52:35.530" style="s2">meeting for a few months we are figuring</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.020" end="00:52:37.540" style="s2">out what tools are going to be in common</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.530" end="00:52:38.950" style="s2">that we all need what solutions can we</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.540" end="00:52:39.470" style="s2">solve together how can we create all new</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.950" end="00:52:41.869" style="s2">in salute</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.470" end="00:52:45.260" style="s2">one we just started the Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.869" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">we&#39;re doing trial and error as we go and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.260" end="00:52:49.640" style="s2">having hopefully have any fun along the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">way right and that is where we&#39;re at so</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.640" end="00:52:53.030" style="s2">I hope they&#39;ve kind of the explainer and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.650" style="s2">where we&#39;re at and then what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.030" end="00:52:58.579" style="s2">looking to do is have more people join</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.650" end="00:53:00.230" style="s2">and get involved in the meta project to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.579" end="00:53:02.690" style="s2">the much as they want to so it can also</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.230" end="00:53:06.349" style="s2">help their personal project their</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.690" end="00:53:07.819" style="s2">individual project um but that then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.349" end="00:53:11.270" style="s2">like the explainer the elevator pitch</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.819" end="00:53:12.410" style="s2">and where you&#39;re at right at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.270" end="00:53:14.780" style="s2">beginning stages and they were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.410" end="00:53:17.380" style="s2">far along maybe what we do is the three</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.780" end="00:53:20.270" style="s2">of us before or I guess what we&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.550" end="00:53:46.910" style="s2">the list of you know okay the five</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.770" end="00:53:48.770" style="s2">minutes work or not even the five</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.910" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">minutes was too long or the elevator</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.770" end="00:53:52.369" style="s2">pitch worked but you know this one was</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.680" style="s2">too long and that one was maybe too</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.369" end="00:53:57.770" style="s2">short like start to use real examples to</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.680" end="00:54:00.410" style="s2">build the framework for okay so we just</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.770" end="00:54:02.270" style="s2">did our first round of these here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.410" end="00:54:04.040" style="s2">we learned we&#39;re asking anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.270" end="00:54:05.780" style="s2">that also wants to do this go make you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.040" end="00:54:07.069" style="s2">know your own video either just make it</p>

<p begin="00:54:12.020" end="00:54:18.230" style="s2">round one I definitely know two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.280" end="00:54:21.829" style="s2">for us to do this in the Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.230" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">I want to like have people submitting</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.829" end="00:54:25.640" style="s2">videos right away because whatever even</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:27.770" style="s2">if they&#39;re horrible if they&#39;re unlisted</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.640" end="00:54:31.430" style="s2">we&#39;re watching them internally right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.770" end="00:54:32.890" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily like I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.430" end="00:54:35.300" style="s2">want to be like this is how</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.890" end="00:54:37.670" style="s2">unprofessional it is you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.300" end="00:54:41.210" style="s2">get a video tog refer and edit it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.670" end="00:54:44.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like stumble on your words your</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.250" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">not as part of it it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.230" end="00:54:51.349" style="s2">explainer video this is the best I got</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:53.300" style="s2">this is the 30 second elevator pitch</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.349" end="00:54:55.850" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna change from time to like</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.300" end="00:54:57.950" style="s2">every time I say it and here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.850" end="00:54:59.630" style="s2">we&#39;re at and if I did another one it</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.950" end="00:55:00.740" style="s2">would be probably completely different</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.630" end="00:55:02.630" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s not scripted</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.740" end="00:55:04.040" style="s2">you could script it if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.630" end="00:55:05.840" style="s2">right but then we&#39;re having the met more</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.040" end="00:55:08.120" style="s2">of the meta conversation on what works</p>

<p begin="00:55:45.380" end="00:55:49.610" style="s2">most of videos they&#39;ll assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.210" end="00:55:52.340" style="s2">person is at least watch the first one</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.610" end="00:55:55.010" style="s2">so they have the context and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.340" end="00:55:57.020" style="s2">just enough day yeah I think the very</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.010" end="00:55:59.300" style="s2">first video is like an extended elevator</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.020" end="00:56:01.340" style="s2">pitch and then I would plan on every</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.300" end="00:56:02.840" style="s2">video like you know 10 15 second</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.340" end="00:56:04.790" style="s2">elevator pitch like super short right</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.840" end="00:56:06.560" style="s2">like in mine it&#39;s trying to fight</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.790" end="00:56:08.870" style="s2">misinformation and politics science and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.560" end="00:56:10.790" style="s2">news that&#39;s it yeah well I would go in2</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.870" end="00:56:12.800" style="s2">bla bla bla but the first one might be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.790" end="00:56:14.300" style="s2">little bit more you know in the politics</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.800" end="00:56:16.040" style="s2">and news and this this this like doing a</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.300" end="00:56:17.870" style="s2">bit more because it&#39;s the first one and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.040" end="00:56:20.570" style="s2">then you can go into where things are at</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.870" end="00:56:21.590" style="s2">we&#39;ll figure that overtime to like if</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.570" end="00:56:23.630" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve watched three or four</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.590" end="00:56:25.640" style="s2">Bentley&#39;s might be like okay it actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.630" end="00:56:28.820" style="s2">does make sense to have the elevator</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.640" end="00:56:30.790" style="s2">pitch or maybe that&#39;s a separate thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.820" end="00:56:33.110" style="s2">you know we can figure it out as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.790" end="00:56:34.940" style="s2">doing them especially if we&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.110" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">each other&#39;s then we can start to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.940" end="00:56:40.760" style="s2">like okay I get it yeah maybe we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:42.110" style="s2">do the other yeah I just like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.760" end="00:56:45.380" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re not catching up with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.110" end="00:56:48.260" style="s2">project to to binge-watch and the less</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.380" end="00:56:50.270" style="s2">of an intro and an outro the easier the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.260" end="00:56:55.220" style="s2">been watching binge watching is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.270" end="00:56:56.810" style="s2">actually wanted to it&#39;d be neat oh you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.220" end="00:57:00.860" style="s2">there might be a way to do this actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.810" end="00:57:02.800" style="s2">but like in Netflix you can skip the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.860" end="00:57:06.470" style="s2">intro and then what happened last</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.800" end="00:57:07.160" style="s2">episode right so kind of that we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.470" end="00:57:10.970" style="s2">here&#39;s a stir</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.160" end="00:57:12.530" style="s2">of everything and then if I think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.970" end="00:57:15.740" style="s2">people gonna stumble cross and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.530" end="00:57:18.740" style="s2">individual video I might choose to throw</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.740" end="00:57:21.260" style="s2">a head or an opening and a closing or</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.740" end="00:57:22.850" style="s2">something but yeah yeah right if I give</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.260" end="00:57:24.740" style="s2">my elevator pitch the beginning of each</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.850" end="00:57:26.510" style="s2">one and I watch it and I know that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.740" end="00:57:28.790" style="s2">30 seconds and then I share it from this</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.510" end="00:57:31.100" style="s2">to 30-second mark if you don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.790" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">can go back and if you do know you just</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.100" end="00:57:36.020" style="s2">watch forward yeah yeah I what we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:37.670" style="s2">also do is if we do you know three to</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.020" end="00:57:39.290" style="s2">five videos with an elevator pitch</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.670" end="00:57:40.820" style="s2">we might each just go through our videos</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.290" end="00:57:42.770" style="s2">pick our favorite one and make that a</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.820" end="00:57:44.810" style="s2">standalone video and then that can be</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.770" end="00:57:46.430" style="s2">using context for everything you want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.810" end="00:57:48.830" style="s2">know what we collection is great go</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.430" end="00:57:50.930" style="s2">watch this pretty second elevator pitch</p>
