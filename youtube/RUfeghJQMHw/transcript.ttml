<p begin="00:19:38.410" end="00:19:42.250" style="s2">little bit more time on Fridays so today</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.600" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll just deal probably with one</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.250" end="00:19:48.280" style="s2">question or two one that have is from</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:50.020" style="s2">Kirk roller I noticed that I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.280" end="00:19:51.820" style="s2">struggling to feel as I&#39;m getting a full</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.020" end="00:19:55.090" style="s2">breath with belly breathing without</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.820" end="00:19:56.770" style="s2">raising my shoulders this might be too</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.090" end="00:19:58.450" style="s2">much information but I think this might</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.770" end="00:20:01.630" style="s2">be a result of wearing a bra for 30</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.450" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">years often ones that are very tight for</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.630" end="00:20:04.510" style="s2">aesthetics would it be good just to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:07.240" style="s2">spend some time practicing breathing</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.510" end="00:20:09.550" style="s2">spreading my lungs yes so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.240" end="00:20:16.420" style="s2">is a very prevalent problem actually for</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.550" end="00:20:23.140" style="s2">a lot of women and so the thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.420" end="00:20:25.420" style="s2">to don&#39;t try to force your breath try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.140" end="00:20:27.940" style="s2">see instead if you can relax into</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.420" end="00:20:30.460" style="s2">deepest deepest breath that is naturally</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.940" end="00:20:33.540" style="s2">occurring and you may not get your</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.460" end="00:20:35.980" style="s2">breath very far down into your belly and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.540" end="00:20:38.380" style="s2">you may need to raid your shoulder now</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.980" end="00:20:40.690" style="s2">see if what you can do is relax and open</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.380" end="00:20:43.930" style="s2">your shoulders and let that shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.690" end="00:20:48.280" style="s2">maybe as so as you know subtle and as</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.930" end="00:20:50.950" style="s2">supple as possible and then again don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.280" end="00:20:52.210" style="s2">try to free to to force it the fuming</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.950" end="00:20:54.160" style="s2">they can maybe not getting enough breath</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.210" end="00:20:57.160" style="s2">see if you can relax more and feel more</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.160" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">that you&#39;re open inside that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.160" end="00:21:03.160" style="s2">restrictions inside your chest rather</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:06.790" style="s2">than just lifting see if you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.160" end="00:21:10.300" style="s2">sort of opening and melting and trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.790" end="00:21:12.940" style="s2">as much as you can to let a natural kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.300" end="00:21:15.580" style="s2">of breathing slowly erode to the tension</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.940" end="00:21:17.860" style="s2">and slowly afford a sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.580" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">actually are getting complete enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.860" end="00:21:24.370" style="s2">breath and see if you can work with this</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:26.560" style="s2">over time until you then the motion that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.370" end="00:21:30.520" style="s2">you&#39;re allowing in your shoulders is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.560" end="00:21:32.170" style="s2">very subtle and you&#39;re getting a sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.520" end="00:21:33.580" style="s2">that there&#39;s an inner opening around</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.170" end="00:21:35.800" style="s2">your lungs</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.580" end="00:21:38.830" style="s2">and that it&#39;s beginning very gradually</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.800" end="00:21:41.650" style="s2">of its own accord to deepen into optimum</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.830" end="00:21:44.950" style="s2">you might also want to do some exercises</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.650" end="00:21:46.630" style="s2">that are chest opening exercises there&#39;s</p>
