<p begin="00:00:38.549" end="00:00:46.269" style="s2">recommend going back to the previous</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.760" end="00:00:48.940" style="s2">videos especially the the two</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.269" end="00:00:51.250" style="s2">instructional videos and then join us</p>

<p begin="00:00:55.600" end="00:01:00.850" style="s2">the previous videos in order to do that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.970" end="00:01:03.610" style="s2">I&#39;m going to briefly review what we did</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.850" end="00:01:05.830" style="s2">last time then we will sit together and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.610" end="00:01:09.250" style="s2">then we will have some times for some</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.830" end="00:01:11.140" style="s2">Q&amp;A so of course we we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.250" end="00:01:13.060" style="s2">center now and then last time we</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.140" end="00:01:15.729" style="s2">practice the kind of relaxation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.060" end="00:01:17.649" style="s2">cultivating in meditation part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.729" end="00:01:19.390" style="s2">core for we&#39;re finding our root we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.649" end="00:01:21.850" style="s2">finding relaxation that doesn&#39;t take us</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.390" end="00:01:23.829" style="s2">into unconsciousness and sleep we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.850" end="00:01:25.960" style="s2">finding relaxation that gives us a sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.829" end="00:01:28.810" style="s2">of sensitivity but also within that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.960" end="00:01:30.820" style="s2">flowing sensitivity stability and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.810" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">what we do is we move our attention to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.820" end="00:01:38.200" style="s2">four locations front back and center</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:41.020" style="s2">hears click first locations I area in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.200" end="00:01:45.580" style="s2">the front heart area don.t an area</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.020" end="00:01:47.770" style="s2">contact area back back of the skull</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.580" end="00:01:51.220" style="s2">between the shoulders opposite solar</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.060" end="00:01:59.080" style="s2">awareness with the area you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.460" end="00:02:01.270" style="s2">that kind of sensitization you do when</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.080" end="00:02:03.400" style="s2">you&#39;re listening out of particular at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.270" end="00:02:05.830" style="s2">party to a particular conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.400" end="00:02:07.720" style="s2">then you&#39;re loosening for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.830" end="00:02:09.729" style="s2">listening you relax a not to make things</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.720" end="00:02:13.780" style="s2">feel better or make things go away but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.729" end="00:02:15.130" style="s2">to open up open up your awareness you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.780" end="00:02:17.500" style="s2">letting it flow which means you let it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.130" end="00:02:19.270" style="s2">fill write your introspective awareness</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.500" end="00:02:21.460" style="s2">so you&#39;re trying to get this deep fusion</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.270" end="00:02:23.530" style="s2">between your introspective awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.460" end="00:02:25.540" style="s2">your introspective awareness and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.530" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2">you let it go you don&#39;t get a meshed or</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.540" end="00:02:29.020" style="s2">attached to it and then you do the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.100" end="00:02:31.600" style="s2">opening and melting and draining down</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.020" end="00:02:35.890" style="s2">you do that as I said for each one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.600" end="00:02:37.600" style="s2">the center&#39;s front back and center when</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.890" end="00:02:39.610" style="s2">you get to the base each time you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.600" end="00:02:41.530" style="s2">imagine it sinking into the earth three</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.610" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">feet like the root of a tree really</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.530" end="00:02:47.170" style="s2">enhancing that sense of groundedness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:49.330" style="s2">connectedness a sense of increased</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.170" end="00:02:51.610" style="s2">stability and nourishment so that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.330" end="00:02:53.980" style="s2">come eventually to be sitting as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.610" end="00:02:56.650" style="s2">tradition says as still as they Mountain</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.980" end="00:02:57.130" style="s2">others the stability but as alert as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.650" end="00:02:58.750" style="s2">warrior</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.130" end="00:03:01.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a sensitivity and I gave you some</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.750" end="00:03:04.510" style="s2">martial art ideas in order to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.780" end="00:03:08.590" style="s2">of that so when we sit first I&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.510" end="00:03:14.140" style="s2">time right at your own pace now I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.590" end="00:03:15.550" style="s2">find your Center then find your root all</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.140" end="00:03:17.019" style="s2">three lines and there were all three</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.550" end="00:03:18.760" style="s2">roots become one root and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.019" end="00:03:20.200" style="s2">done adjust your Center and roots so</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.760" end="00:03:22.030" style="s2">they you&#39;re a root feels like an</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.200" end="00:03:25.720" style="s2">extension and deepening of your Center</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.030" end="00:03:28.060" style="s2">and then begin to follow your breath all</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.720" end="00:03:29.380" style="s2">right so let&#39;s prepare make sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.060" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2">comfortable ready to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.380" end="00:03:36.090" style="s2">we&#39;ll sit for 15 minutes and then we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">will come out for questions and answers</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">begin</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.690" end="00:18:27.780" style="s2">slowly begin to come out of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.650" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">practice trying as best you can to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.780" end="00:18:31.880" style="s2">integrate your practice with your</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">everyday consciousness and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.880" end="00:18:37.080" style="s2">sorry some of you are watching I had to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:40.920" style="s2">come out of my meditation I have many</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.080" end="00:18:43.260" style="s2">years in my left ear and I was having an</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.920" end="00:18:44.550" style="s2">immense attack and so I needed to come</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.260" end="00:18:47.240" style="s2">out of the meditation in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.550" end="00:18:50.580" style="s2">stabilize for a bit that may happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.240" end="00:18:53.580" style="s2">please don&#39;t take any worry about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.580" end="00:18:56.340" style="s2">just continue with your practice so</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.580" end="00:19:02.310" style="s2">today I&#39;d like to now move to answering</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.340" end="00:19:04.740" style="s2">some questions that you may have what if</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.310" end="00:19:07.380" style="s2">you need to change position well as it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.740" end="00:19:09.840" style="s2">just showed sometimes things happen and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.380" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">you need to change positions I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.840" end="00:19:13.890" style="s2">having a manners attack and so I needed</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.570" style="s2">to come out of the meditation if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.890" end="00:19:20.850" style="s2">having that kind of thing of course you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:24.270" style="s2">need to shift position if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.850" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2">pain or discomfort like in your arm or</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.270" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2">your leg</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.600" end="00:19:34.190" style="s2">and then return your breath centering</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.169" end="00:19:36.169" style="s2">your breath as you do now it may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.190" end="00:19:39.610" style="s2">though that you do that multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.169" end="00:19:41.929" style="s2">and then the pain is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.610" end="00:19:44.330" style="s2">oppressive so here&#39;s a general principle</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.929" end="00:19:47.570" style="s2">and this is a principle I just adjust</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.330" end="00:19:49.820" style="s2">myself at first I was just meditating</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.570" end="00:19:52.669" style="s2">through the minions attack but if it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.820" end="00:19:55.010" style="s2">gets to the point where you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.669" end="00:19:58.340" style="s2">capable of learning as all you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.010" end="00:20:01.630" style="s2">is trying to endure with the distraction</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.340" end="00:20:07.070" style="s2">then shift your position right</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.630" end="00:20:10.429" style="s2">maybe recenter reroute start all over</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.070" end="00:20:13.100" style="s2">again so the general principle here is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.429" end="00:20:15.260" style="s2">if you are all you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.100" end="00:20:18.590" style="s2">struggling to endure with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.260" end="00:20:22.460" style="s2">distraction then you make the movement</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.590" end="00:20:23.929" style="s2">you need maybe you just maybe you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.460" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">to open your eyes for a sec and then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.929" end="00:20:32.210" style="s2">go back into the practice if on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:34.549" style="s2">other hand you think you need to move</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.210" end="00:20:36.980" style="s2">because you feel that you&#39;ve lost mentor</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.549" end="00:20:38.630" style="s2">or connection to your root and just make</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.980" end="00:20:41.630" style="s2">the minor adjustments you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.630" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">in order to find your Center in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.630" end="00:20:47.030" style="s2">root again there&#39;s a question what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:49.549" style="s2">why the quick succession between</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.030" end="00:20:51.230" style="s2">listening seeing relaxing etc yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.549" end="00:20:53.210" style="s2">it felt as if more time was needed to</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.230" end="00:20:57.500" style="s2">sense the body better this is from</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.210" end="00:20:59.240" style="s2">Philip and yes Philip I did that because</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.500" end="00:21:01.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve done this for a long time and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.240" end="00:21:04.490" style="s2">sort of try to get the average amount of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.610" end="00:21:06.110" style="s2">time that people liked also I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.490" end="00:21:09.890" style="s2">to work within the time limits that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.110" end="00:21:12.710" style="s2">have to work with and so you can do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.890" end="00:21:14.750" style="s2">routing of course at your own pace but</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.710" end="00:21:17.419" style="s2">you&#39;ll find over time that the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.750" end="00:21:22.520" style="s2">time you have to dedicate to it will</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.419" end="00:21:28.130" style="s2">will shrink so I want to thank everybody</p>
