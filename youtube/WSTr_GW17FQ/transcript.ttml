<p begin="00:00:00.080" end="00:00:04.240" style="s2">well what if we grounded in in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.000" end="00:00:05.920" style="s2">community community like ours</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.240" end="00:00:08.080" style="s2">you know where this is a new community</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.920" end="00:00:09.280" style="s2">where we we&#39;ve just formed in really the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.080" end="00:00:12.080" style="s2">last two months we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.280" end="00:00:12.880" style="s2">almost at our two-month anniversary uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.080" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">how would how would you recommend for</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:19.359" style="s2">example we</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:20.480" style="s2">what what should we be thinking of in in</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.359" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">setting up</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.480" end="00:00:24.320" style="s2">you know our network we&#39;re in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">you know of crafting roles and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.320" end="00:00:27.439" style="s2">responsibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">you know different roles that people are</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.439" end="00:00:30.960" style="s2">are taking within the community</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:32.480" style="s2">or some some will be organizing events</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.960" end="00:00:33.760" style="s2">other people will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">you know you know maybe leading</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.760" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">meditations or or other type of sessions</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:39.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:41.840" style="s2">uh others will be working on structure</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.520" end="00:00:46.480" style="s2">you know what what what can we take from</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.840" end="00:00:46.480" style="s2">your work to help direct us</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:50.079" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s actually a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.079" end="00:00:55.199" style="s2">let&#39;s begin with i&#39;m going to put it in</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.360" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">form of recommendations as opposed to in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.199" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">the form of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:01.359" style="s2">options because the option space is</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">quite large in terms of recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.359" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">some things that i would point out</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">are a network design</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">one of the variables you can look at is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:14.320" style="s2">the degree to which a particular node</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.000" style="s2">and domain which is to say a cluster of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.320" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">nodes is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.000" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">specialized or generalized and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">if for example in the military you tend</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">high levels of specialization in</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">in for example decision making and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:31.360" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">major function in army has a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.360" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">specific domain of in scope of decision</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s very very important that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:40.640" style="s2">particular node know when a decision</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:42.159" style="s2">is is in its scope if it&#39;s too big it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">has to go up if it&#39;s too little has to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.159" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">go down like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">structure and notice what happens there</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">is that once you&#39;ve made a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">commitments</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:53.360" style="s2">to how you&#39;re designing your network a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">bunch of other stuff comes with it right</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">so if you design</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">a network that is of the sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">post-world war ii military</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">then if you wanted to be effective at</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">all a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.040" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">energy a lot of attention a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">capacity given individuals actually has</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">to be focused on questions like</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">is this particular area of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">is right for my level of authority or</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">should i push it down or should i send</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">it up</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">um so you may or may not have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">planning on that as being part of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">you&#39;re spending people&#39;s time on but</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">ultimately it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">you have to and so it gets smuggled in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s a i think a thing that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">miss a lot is that the there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:32.480" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">natural network design clusters that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.480" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">once you&#39;ve made a few choices</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">a lot of other things follow now in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">context of what you guys are doing what</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">my sense is there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">or three things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">simultaneously that may be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">of tension that may be a healthy tension</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">so on the one hand i&#39;ve mentioned i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">heard you mention the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">community and it feels to me like in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">tone of your voice when you say it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">that you actually mean that in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">of communitas like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">sense of togetherness or wholeness in</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">being together</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">yes um maybe in the monastic sense more</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">than in the uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">village sense but you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">all in in direction in that way</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">equally there seems to be a sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">some sort of mission or objective or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">purpose more than just shared values</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">but interestingly that&#39;s oriented</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">towards something which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">uh how would i say this singular in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">in the domain of purpose which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion for</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">example in that document</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">it feels like that may be a particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.720" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">area of interest and as you said</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">the meaning crisis right there is a not</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">just a calling</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">that there&#39;s a gap people are gathered</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">into this community as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">the bell that john is wrong but also</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">there seems to be an</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">awareness or intent to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">focus in the direction of that calling</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like hey we all gathered for</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">the meeting crisis but now that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">just kind of become</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">a barbecue um but actually a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">there&#39;s something about this column that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">has meaningfulness to it no pun intended</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">and therefore should have a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">or uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">so again that kind of that pulls more in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">the direction of a monastic community</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">and less in the direction of a uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">sort of general purpose where people</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">live um</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">if you know if you look at the topology</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">of monastic communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">it&#39;s actually interesting because there</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">is there&#39;s a real distinction you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">villages have a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">natural topology and by necessity than</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">monastic communities the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">community has to have more formal</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">structure it actually has to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">certain levels of certain roles that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">people play</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">and a lot of rituals that keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">uh disciplined attention while still</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">maintaining the real integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">community like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">many monks who i know feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">live human relationship and community</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">and monasteries is much stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">any other place they&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">but this would imply uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">orienting towards um</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">like ritual being thoughtful about</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">having certain kinds of ritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">create a an easy and ease</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">maintain</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">integrity in relationship to the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">while</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">well and holding like making relatively</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">ease full</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">the the that level of rigor</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">so that it can then also happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">context of community</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">um you would also want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">because you&#39;re doing something in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">domain of community that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">virtual we don&#39;t really know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:58.479" style="s2">easy human beings naturally do communal</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">stuff in physical space particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.479" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">around things like food and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">kind of viviality uh it&#39;s harder to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">that in a virtual space because you</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">don&#39;t have the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">context and signals so i would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:12.639" style="s2">playfully and experimentally but</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.639" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">thoughtfully making that an object of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">intent</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">so wonder what kinds of things might</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">we do to support a deeper felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">humanness like</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">and do we want to have um if you play</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">dungeons and dragons or a roleplaying</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">like have our identities have our</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">identities have a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">richness and playfulness to them so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">when people encounter each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">they&#39;re already drawn into something</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">like how do you render the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">texture and feel uh of relationality</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary for community</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">in a virtual environment in certain you</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">know aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">is one possible way and playfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">another possible way</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s another chunk so i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">putting in there the toolkit includes</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">ritual and intentionally thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">creating rituals</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">largely to increase rigor while also</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">increasing easefulness</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">the second one would be to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">intentional</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">around things like playfulness and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">of expression of self into a shared</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">a third and this is now again i&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">starting to get a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">fluid is um how would i say this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">a there&#39;s a distinction what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">is between</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">uh two kinds of design there&#39;s a uh what</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">i might call</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">after my forest landry an omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">design or a uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">propositional design a blueprint kind um</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">and a transcendent design or a um</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">sense oriented design has more of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">feeling of intuitive or</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">felt sense actually it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">intuitive mentions felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">and so i might recommend</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">practices that orient groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">who build their capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">gathering a shared felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">in themselves enhancing their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">capacity of their own felt sense and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">then using</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">the individual and collective capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">to discern</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">rightness through felt sense as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">primary mode of collective design and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">decision making</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">in how the the environment progresses</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">um and and and evolves</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s more oh keep on keep on going</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">no no i do not want you to stop keep on</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">um so so the two more that come up i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">actually seeing john in my mind&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">now and hearing his voice which</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">uh i can&#39;t remember her name she&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">influence of both johns and of dave</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">snowden&#39;s and one of the sort of primary</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">in uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.300" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">like how complex systems actually emerge</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">or how you can design for emergence</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">has to do with sort of enabling</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">constraints and disabling constraints</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">thinking in that way and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">thinking about this as having a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">necessary autopoaces to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">is to think about how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">identify what are the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">enabling constraints and disabling</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.040" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">that actually makes it be a felt organic</p>
