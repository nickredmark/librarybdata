<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">bit of good news it&#39;s rather personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.140" end="00:03:04.890" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve actually got my tenure since</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:12.390" style="s2">I sent the thing and so I&#39;m now an</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.890" end="00:03:19.290" style="s2">associate professor alright so let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.390" end="00:03:22.739" style="s2">right to it so if you take a look at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.290" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">recent survey in the United Kingdom you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.739" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">get this kind of result eighty-nine</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">percent of the people 16 to 29 the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">up-and-coming people claim that their</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">lives are meaningless not sort of off</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">what sort of could be better</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:42.269" style="s2">meaningless that&#39;s how they actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">responded right the average overall was</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.269" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">80% for all groups and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:55.380" style="s2">United Kingdom not some war-torn tore</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:57.720" style="s2">war-torn part of the world right those</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.380" end="00:04:01.140" style="s2">over 60 which includes I guess some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.720" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">you here you do the best you do the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.140" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">where the best is only 55% of that group</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.670" end="00:04:12.450" style="s2">report that their lives are meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:14.519" style="s2">that&#39;s the best group now a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.450" end="00:04:16.140" style="s2">people say that the reason why their</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:19.169" style="s2">lives are meaningless is due to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">financial reasons but this actually goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.169" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">against a lot of evidence that shows</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">that once you&#39;re out of poverty finances</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:28.380" style="s2">do not contribute significantly to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.669" style="s2">meaning in life poverty really does</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.380" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">Hamra meaning in life but once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.669" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2">out of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">the things that seem to matter well</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.370" end="00:04:34.380" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about some of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:36.600" style="s2">but their connection there&#39;s two other</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.380" end="00:04:38.940" style="s2">people connectedness to reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.600" end="00:04:40.289" style="s2">those are the main issues but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.940" end="00:04:42.990" style="s2">interesting to note that many people</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.289" end="00:04:46.830" style="s2">don&#39;t actually get that they think their</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.990" end="00:04:50.700" style="s2">finances are what&#39;s the key problem many</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.830" end="00:04:53.400" style="s2">of the elderly people or older people at</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.700" end="00:04:56.520" style="s2">least 73 percent of them in fact say</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.400" end="00:04:59.610" style="s2">that they are very lonely and have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.520" end="00:05:01.979" style="s2">that way for years what we do know is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.610" end="00:05:02.600" style="s2">and this is more accurate 34 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.979" end="00:05:05.240" style="s2">the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.600" end="00:05:07.850" style="s2">said that mental health issues were</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.240" end="00:05:10.360" style="s2">causing the lack of meaning and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.850" end="00:05:13.730" style="s2">makes more sense because we know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.360" end="00:05:21.200" style="s2">anxiety rates depression rates etc are</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.730" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">on the rise okay so this is yeah see</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.200" end="00:05:29.540" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna get dark for a while so</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:31.940" style="s2">Chris mr. Pietro and I we we do a thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.540" end="00:05:33.470" style="s2">where we talk about sort of what we call</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">the symptom ology in the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.470" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to show a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:39.200" style="s2">different factors that make sense given</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:40.520" style="s2">some of the data you just saw there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.200" end="00:05:42.590" style="s2">lot more data you can check out the book</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.520" end="00:05:45.230" style="s2">so that that survey is just an</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.590" end="00:05:47.270" style="s2">indication and one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.230" end="00:05:49.430" style="s2">talked about is you know that suicide</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.270" end="00:05:51.310" style="s2">now worldwide suicide is going down</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.430" end="00:05:55.880" style="s2">because poverty is going down worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.310" end="00:05:57.500" style="s2">but for young people and for actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.880" end="00:06:00.410" style="s2">some affluent parts the United States</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.500" end="00:06:02.660" style="s2">like the Silicon Valley suicide rate is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.410" end="00:06:04.910" style="s2">going up child suicide rate in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.660" end="00:06:07.870" style="s2">United States child means under 12 has</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.910" end="00:06:07.870" style="s2">doubled in the last ten years</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:13.670" style="s2">interestingly as I just mentioned you</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">have the overlap with the mental health</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.670" end="00:06:19.250" style="s2">crisis and boy do I see this at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:21.800" style="s2">University when I started teaching 25</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.250" end="00:06:22.460" style="s2">years ago in a galaxy far far away long</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.800" end="00:06:25.490" style="s2">time ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.460" end="00:06:28.850" style="s2">alright I would get a student coming in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.490" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">in distress maybe one or two a semester</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.850" end="00:06:38.170" style="s2">I now get three or four a week which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.520" end="00:06:38.170" style="s2">a very taxing on me as you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.500" end="00:06:48.050" style="s2">so we know that again this is going up</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:51.170" style="s2">pretty much across North America Europe</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.050" end="00:06:54.620" style="s2">I already mentioned there&#39;s increase in</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.170" end="00:06:56.630" style="s2">loneliness the UK the UK is setting up a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.620" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">Ministry of loneliness which sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.630" end="00:07:06.500" style="s2">something out of Orwell the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:08.660" style="s2">we know about is the rise of lots of new</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.500" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">forms of addiction I want to talk a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.660" end="00:07:13.500" style="s2">about addiction now let&#39;s in order to</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.500" end="00:07:18.090" style="s2">modes of existence existential modes so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.220" end="00:07:19.950" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna give you some philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.090" end="00:07:21.420" style="s2">terms here they&#39;ll be they will be multi</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.950" end="00:07:26.580" style="s2">syllabic with the intent to try and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.420" end="00:07:28.410" style="s2">impress you and so let&#39;s talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.580" end="00:07:30.990" style="s2">idea from the psychologist Erich Fromm</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.410" end="00:07:34.110" style="s2">that you have two basic kinds of needs</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.990" end="00:07:35.610" style="s2">you have a having needs these are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.110" end="00:07:38.610" style="s2">needs that are met these are largely</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.610" end="00:07:40.260" style="s2">homeostatic needs these are needs better</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.250" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">in that mode right I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.950" end="00:07:53.490" style="s2">problem-solving mode I&#39;m trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:54.750" style="s2">my problems I&#39;m trying to overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.490" end="00:07:55.560" style="s2">obstacles to prevent me from getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.750" end="00:07:58.350" style="s2">what I need</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.560" end="00:08:00.300" style="s2">and so I relate to things very</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.350" end="00:08:02.070" style="s2">categorically this is a cop this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.300" end="00:08:03.630" style="s2">water this cop reminds me of all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.070" end="00:08:05.340" style="s2">other cups I&#39;ve had this water is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.630" end="00:08:07.890" style="s2">similar to all the other water I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.340" end="00:08:10.169" style="s2">had and that categorical thinking lets</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.890" end="00:08:12.450" style="s2">me quickly solve my problems to get I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.169" end="00:08:16.140" style="s2">mean what I want this is called the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.450" end="00:08:18.570" style="s2">telic mode by Apter what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.140" end="00:08:19.950" style="s2">as I get more and more arousal I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.570" end="00:08:21.450" style="s2">getting more and more frustrated because</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.950" end="00:08:23.880" style="s2">arousal means I&#39;m putting in more and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.450" end="00:08:26.750" style="s2">more effort but I&#39;m not getting my goal</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.880" end="00:08:29.460" style="s2">so this is experience very aversive Lee</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.750" end="00:08:31.260" style="s2">it leads to what blue-ber called an i it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.460" end="00:08:33.510" style="s2">relationship with everything your</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.260" end="00:08:34.950" style="s2">motivation here is largely curiosity you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.510" end="00:08:37.229" style="s2">got a gap and you&#39;re trying to fill it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.950" end="00:08:39.060" style="s2">in and notice if I prolonged curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.229" end="00:08:41.490" style="s2">that&#39;s aversive to you you don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.060" end="00:08:43.289" style="s2">if curiosity gets extended too long like</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.490" end="00:08:44.820" style="s2">if you if you were watching a leading a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.289" end="00:08:46.440" style="s2">mystery novel or watching a mystery and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.820" end="00:08:47.000" style="s2">they kept and you never found out who</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.440" end="00:08:50.700" style="s2">did it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">that&#39;s awful right that&#39;s horrible now</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.700" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">this is adaptive you need this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:55.890" style="s2">nothing wrong with this mode but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.420" style="s2">very different from what he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.890" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">being mode maybe it should have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.420" end="00:09:02.510" style="s2">because he should have called it the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:05.100" style="s2">becoming mode this is the mode that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.510" end="00:09:06.810" style="s2">has to do with your developmental needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.100" end="00:09:08.460" style="s2">you need to become you need to become</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.810" end="00:09:11.010" style="s2">mature you need to become honest you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.460" end="00:09:12.870" style="s2">need to be in love all right these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.010" end="00:09:14.280" style="s2">not homeostatic needs these are called</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.870" end="00:09:16.650" style="s2">autopoietic needs these are needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.280" end="00:09:18.630" style="s2">basically how you&#39;re making yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.650" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">making yourself have them have more</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.630" end="00:09:25.620" style="s2">meaning in life these are very important</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:26.360" style="s2">needs to you so here when you&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.620" end="00:09:28.209" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.360" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.209" end="00:09:33.140" style="s2">arousal is actually very positive so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:36.709" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me when you&#39;re having sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.140" end="00:09:39.050" style="s2">right more arousal is good right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.709" end="00:09:41.060" style="s2">it&#39;s positive or you&#39;re engaged in doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.050" end="00:09:44.029" style="s2">an activity you really enjoy arousal</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.060" end="00:09:45.649" style="s2">goes up and pleasure goes up at the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.029" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">time it&#39;s a very different mode because</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.649" end="00:09:49.610" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do there is engage</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:53.390" style="s2">in growth rather than return to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.610" end="00:09:55.220" style="s2">homeostatic baseline so you tend to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.390" end="00:09:57.320" style="s2">relate to things in what Buber called an</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.220" end="00:10:01.100" style="s2">eigth our relationship let me show you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.320" end="00:10:03.320" style="s2">what I mean okay remember how I related</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.100" end="00:10:04.790" style="s2">to the cup you know reminds me of all</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.320" end="00:10:07.610" style="s2">the other cops the water reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.790" end="00:10:09.860" style="s2">all the other water water now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.610" end="00:10:11.570" style="s2">entering in I&#39;m in a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.860" end="00:10:14.600" style="s2">relationship with a wonderful woman love</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.570" end="00:10:18.380" style="s2">of my life right if I said to her if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.600" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">came to her and I said my love I&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.380" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">you because you remind me of all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.670" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">other women I&#39;ve ever been with</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:30.290" style="s2">and therefore I know that I can easily</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.069" end="00:10:33.139" style="s2">control and consume you as I need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.290" end="00:10:34.100" style="s2">solve my problems relationships is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.139" end="00:10:36.470" style="s2">going well</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.100" end="00:10:37.850" style="s2">instead I&#39;m entering and I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.470" end="00:10:40.459" style="s2">remember this I&#39;m entering into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.850" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">relationship with her whereby she is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.459" end="00:10:45.079" style="s2">helping me grow beyond myself I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:48.019" style="s2">helping her grow beyond herself and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.079" end="00:10:51.319" style="s2">are we are bound together in this way</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.019" end="00:10:53.329" style="s2">and this tends to be a place where</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.319" end="00:10:55.879" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing that curiosity but</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.329" end="00:10:58.610" style="s2">wonder notice if I can extend wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.879" end="00:11:00.980" style="s2">it can become more positive it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.610" end="00:11:02.300" style="s2">ah now you can&#39;t extend it forever</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.980" end="00:11:04.069" style="s2">because then it will become horror</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.300" end="00:11:06.379" style="s2">that&#39;s why all has these two different</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.069" end="00:11:08.269" style="s2">words awesome and awful because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.379" end="00:11:10.519" style="s2">right on that cusp do you understand the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.269" end="00:11:12.410" style="s2">two modes okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.519" end="00:11:15.050" style="s2">so one of the problems we face in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.410" end="00:11:18.019" style="s2">society is we engage in what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.050" end="00:11:20.420" style="s2">modal confusion we try to solve one</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.019" end="00:11:23.480" style="s2">kinds of one set of needs but from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.420" end="00:11:26.809" style="s2">wrong mode what would that look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.480" end="00:11:31.759" style="s2">well I want to become mature so I buy a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.809" end="00:11:35.930" style="s2">car I want to grow in love so I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.759" end="00:11:37.879" style="s2">more sex do you see now what happens</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.930" end="00:11:39.980" style="s2">with that is I&#39;m trying to satisfy being</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.879" end="00:11:42.199" style="s2">needs within the having mode and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.980" end="00:11:42.649" style="s2">means I ultimately don&#39;t satisfy those</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.199" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.649" end="00:11:49.699" style="s2">I&#39;m very frustrated why is modal</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:51.879" style="s2">confusion something that gets promoted</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.699" end="00:11:54.350" style="s2">in our society well you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.879" end="00:11:56.300" style="s2">the powers that be and I&#39;m not taking</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.350" end="00:11:58.430" style="s2">any particular political stance or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.300" end="00:12:00.740" style="s2">powers that be can manipulate you if</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.430" end="00:12:04.699" style="s2">they modally confuse you because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.740" end="00:12:08.389" style="s2">can get you to buy and consume more and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.699" end="00:12:10.279" style="s2">so Fromm&#39;s point was our society has</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.389" end="00:12:12.410" style="s2">locked us into a kind of modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.279" end="00:12:13.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s two things I need you to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.410" end="00:12:16.370" style="s2">from this first of all the idea of an</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.850" end="00:12:18.230" style="s2">existential mode remember the eye at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.370" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">eye though there&#39;s a way in which our</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.230" end="00:12:23.509" style="s2">identity and the way we identify things</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:25.999" style="s2">in the world are bound together it can</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.509" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">be either I adore I thou sow existential</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.999" end="00:12:31.399" style="s2">mode that reciprocal binding of identity</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:33.410" style="s2">and I also the idea that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.399" end="00:12:35.420" style="s2">modally confused so at a very deep level</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.410" end="00:12:37.610" style="s2">at that level of our existential mode we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.420" end="00:12:38.170" style="s2">can be deeply confused in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.610" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.170" end="00:12:48.430" style="s2">frustrating to us okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:50.019" style="s2">develop this a little bit more just</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.430" end="00:12:53.050" style="s2">reminding you again about the you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.019" end="00:12:54.699" style="s2">the idea of the existential mode and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.050" end="00:12:57.010" style="s2">the book we talk we use the language of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.699" end="00:13:00.519" style="s2">agent and arena like here&#39;s a judge in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.010" end="00:13:02.709" style="s2">the court so the judge assumes a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.519" end="00:13:05.920" style="s2">particular agency a particular identity</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.709" end="00:13:08.829" style="s2">that fits the arena that the judges in</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.920" end="00:13:09.820" style="s2">the court if he went right to a tennis</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.829" end="00:13:12.339" style="s2">game dressed like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.820" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">tried to act that way right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.339" end="00:13:14.110" style="s2">going well</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:15.459" style="s2">unless he&#39;s supposed to be the judge at</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.110" end="00:13:17.649" style="s2">the tennis game but then he&#39;d be in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.459" end="00:13:20.110" style="s2">different situation etc or there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.649" end="00:13:22.300" style="s2">quarterback in the stadium right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.110" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">assuming a particular agency that fits</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.300" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">that arena so again we are always you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:33.639" style="s2">doing it right now we&#39;re always assuming</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:35.470" style="s2">identities your listener and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.639" end="00:13:37.329" style="s2">assigning identities I&#39;m a speaker</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.470" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">you&#39;re not really thinking of me too</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.329" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">very much as how I might be a father</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.889" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">okay agent arena coupling now let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:53.170" style="s2">all of this and go back to the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:56.230" style="s2">addiction because I&#39;m fortunate to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.170" end="00:13:58.390" style="s2">good friends with colleagues with one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.230" end="00:14:00.300" style="s2">the sort of premier people in the world</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.120" end="00:14:07.630" style="s2">his addiction became a world famous</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:20.230" style="s2">common model we have of addiction which</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.899" style="s2">is the disease model the disease model</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.230" end="00:14:26.500" style="s2">is you have a sub a foreign substance in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.899" end="00:14:29.829" style="s2">you and it sort of causes a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.500" end="00:14:33.790" style="s2">biochemical distress that compels you to</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.829" end="00:14:37.389" style="s2">consume this drug and of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.790" end="00:14:40.300" style="s2">a biochemical element to most addictions</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.389" end="00:14:42.730" style="s2">at least that seems reasonable but mark</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.300" end="00:14:43.779" style="s2">proposes that this and I&#39;ve been out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.730" end="00:14:45.550" style="s2">conference where I see many people</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.779" end="00:14:46.990" style="s2">arguing this this model of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.550" end="00:14:48.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work anymore because it just</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.990" end="00:14:51.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sit well with the facts for</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.970" end="00:14:54.930" style="s2">example most</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.990" end="00:14:59.370" style="s2">people spontaneously stop their drug</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.930" end="00:15:01.260" style="s2">abuse in their 30s you don&#39;t hear about</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.370" end="00:15:05.670" style="s2">them why because they don&#39;t consume any</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.260" end="00:15:11.149" style="s2">of our time and resources you have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.670" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">soldiers in Vietnam using opiates heroin</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.149" end="00:15:16.890" style="s2">compulsively and they come back the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:20.990" style="s2">United States and most of them without</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.890" end="00:15:20.990" style="s2">therapeutic intervention stop using</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:27.480" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of evidence like this so</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.649" end="00:15:30.060" style="s2">mark points out that there&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.480" end="00:15:34.279" style="s2">different story probably going on here</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.060" end="00:15:37.190" style="s2">think about the soldier in Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.279" end="00:15:39.779" style="s2">particular agent in a particular arena</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.190" end="00:15:40.200" style="s2">returns back to United States they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.779" end="00:15:41.970" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.200" end="00:15:43.410" style="s2">no longer a soldier they&#39;re a citizen</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.970" end="00:15:45.209" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer in the war in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.410" end="00:15:48.600" style="s2">foreign country they&#39;re back in their</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.209" end="00:15:51.860" style="s2">home do you see it&#39;s a it&#39;s a big shift</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.600" end="00:15:55.380" style="s2">between the agent and Arina relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.860" end="00:15:58.170" style="s2">so what mark proposes is we should pay</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.380" end="00:16:00.089" style="s2">attention to that existential mode or me</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.170" end="00:16:03.029" style="s2">should even make it a verb or coin a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.089" end="00:16:04.350" style="s2">term here that existential moding when</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.029" end="00:16:08.760" style="s2">we try to understand addiction here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.350" end="00:16:12.180" style="s2">his idea so let&#39;s say i&#39;m i consume some</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.760" end="00:16:14.190" style="s2">alcohol and what that does is it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.180" end="00:16:16.230" style="s2">narrows my cognitive flexibility a bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.190" end="00:16:18.660" style="s2">my ability to solve problems goes down a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.230" end="00:16:20.790" style="s2">bit yeah now what does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.660" end="00:16:22.829" style="s2">means that I can&#39;t solve as many</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.790" end="00:16:25.410" style="s2">problems in the world so now the arena</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.829" end="00:16:28.410" style="s2">gets a little bit more narrow for me now</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.410" end="00:16:30.779" style="s2">as the arena gets narrow and I there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.410" end="00:16:34.290" style="s2">less I can but fewer problems I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.779" end="00:16:36.660" style="s2">solve I actually internalize that and my</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.290" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">cognition narrows a bit more and then as</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.660" end="00:16:41.640" style="s2">my cognition narrows a bit more I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">solve fewer problems and you see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.640" end="00:16:46.920" style="s2">happening here it&#39;s going like this he</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:49.649" style="s2">calls that reciprocal narrowing my</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.920" end="00:16:52.440" style="s2">agency narrows and the arena of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.649" end="00:16:54.990" style="s2">world narrows until I come to this place</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.440" end="00:16:57.060" style="s2">I can&#39;t be any other than I am and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.990" end="00:16:57.540" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing I can do to change my</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.060" end="00:17:00.660" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.540" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s addiction reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.660" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:06.039" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing now you see how</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:10.329" style="s2">addiction is a combination of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.039" end="00:17:12.549" style="s2">narrowing and modal confusion because</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.329" end="00:17:15.909" style="s2">the person gets locked into this world</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.549" end="00:17:19.709" style="s2">and then thinks it&#39;s about having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.909" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">particular thing so modal confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.709" end="00:17:28.600" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:31.480" style="s2">mark lunch about this and I said mark if</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.600" end="00:17:35.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a reciprocal narrowing there has</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.480" end="00:17:38.650" style="s2">to also be reciprocal opening and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.049" end="00:17:43.570" style="s2">went oh yes which is nice when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.650" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">does that about your work all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.570" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">want to talk to you about a state that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:50.919" style="s2">is best understood as reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:53.559" style="s2">it&#39;s called the state of flow so this</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.919" end="00:17:54.970" style="s2">person is rock climbing now rock</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.559" end="00:17:56.409" style="s2">climbing if you just talk think about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.970" end="00:18:01.480" style="s2">objectively sounds like some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.409" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">people unintelligible it&#39;s going to hurt</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.480" end="00:18:04.690" style="s2">it&#39;s going to cause you pain and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:06.370" style="s2">struggle you might fall and kill</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.690" end="00:18:10.830" style="s2">yourself and when you get to the top</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.370" end="00:18:13.110" style="s2">come back down so why do people do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.830" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">why do people do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.110" end="00:18:18.370" style="s2">well we&#39;ve talked to them they do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.940" end="00:18:19.659" style="s2">because they get into the flow state you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.370" end="00:18:21.610" style="s2">might have perhaps been in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.659" end="00:18:24.070" style="s2">State the flow state is a state and when</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.610" end="00:18:27.340" style="s2">you feel sort of tremendously at one</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.070" end="00:18:30.130" style="s2">with what you&#39;re doing you feel deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.340" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">connected to it you feel like you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.130" end="00:18:33.610" style="s2">sort of stretching yourself because</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:36.340" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the flow State is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.610" end="00:18:38.110" style="s2">the demands of the situation just exceed</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.340" end="00:18:41.049" style="s2">your skill so you have to sort of grow</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.110" end="00:18:42.820" style="s2">your cognition right there on and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.049" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">you&#39;re pouring everything you&#39;re pulling</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.820" end="00:18:48.580" style="s2">everything of yourself into it and yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:50.620" style="s2">the world is responding very very well</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.580" end="00:18:52.150" style="s2">so like I&#39;m a martial artist right if</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.620" end="00:18:54.820" style="s2">you&#39;re sparring again at the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.150" end="00:18:57.100" style="s2">you it&#39;s it feels like grace it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.820" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">effortless I don&#39;t have to put my arm</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.100" end="00:19:01.539" style="s2">here for a block my arm I just find my</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:04.330" style="s2">arm going there alright so dancers get</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.539" end="00:19:06.370" style="s2">into this jazz jazz musicians get into</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.330" end="00:19:10.570" style="s2">this you can get into this in all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.370" end="00:19:12.580" style="s2">of ways and what&#39;s really significant</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.570" end="00:19:14.950" style="s2">about the flow State</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.580" end="00:19:18.250" style="s2">is it has that sense of discovery about</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.950" end="00:19:21.670" style="s2">it the world seems super salient so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.250" end="00:19:23.470" style="s2">can imagine athletes they do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.670" end="00:19:26.170" style="s2">work to try and get into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.470" end="00:19:27.940" style="s2">because the flow state is optimal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.170" end="00:19:30.340" style="s2">optimal experience in two ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.940" end="00:19:33.420" style="s2">optimal in that people rate this as some</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.340" end="00:19:36.070" style="s2">of the best experiences of their life</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.420" end="00:19:39.820" style="s2">and they don&#39;t say that they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.070" end="00:19:42.190" style="s2">pleasure they&#39;re not having pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.820" end="00:19:44.800" style="s2">and since instead they sense this at one</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.190" end="00:19:47.110" style="s2">mint this deep connectedness this</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.800" end="00:19:49.750" style="s2">reciprocal opening between them and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.110" end="00:19:52.180" style="s2">world the world is opening up they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.750" end="00:19:55.000" style="s2">opening up and it&#39;s coupled together and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.180" end="00:19:57.370" style="s2">it&#39;s at one but it&#39;s also optimal</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.000" end="00:20:00.610" style="s2">performance this is where people do</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.370" end="00:20:05.380" style="s2">their very best now what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.610" end="00:20:07.930" style="s2">interesting for our talk is that flow</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.380" end="00:20:09.130" style="s2">experiences are correlated with meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.930" end="00:20:12.670" style="s2">in life how many of you think you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.130" end="00:20:15.070" style="s2">a flow experience put up your hand good</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.670" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">the rest of you should do more to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.070" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">into flow because it&#39;s predictive of how</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:23.920" style="s2">meaningful you rate your life if you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:25.410" style="s2">into the flow state more often you will</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.920" end="00:20:27.790" style="s2">say that your life is more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.410" end="00:20:29.620" style="s2">which is kind of odd because we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.790" end="00:20:31.690" style="s2">think of meaning as all meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.620" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">must be in terms of all the beliefs I</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.690" end="00:20:41.770" style="s2">accumulate but no it&#39;s more about this</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:44.580" style="s2">flowing connectedness ok reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.770" end="00:20:46.930" style="s2">opening connectedness meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.580" end="00:20:48.850" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a few other things I</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.930" end="00:20:51.370" style="s2">won&#39;t go through all of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:20:54.550" style="s2">a couple things just quickly to note we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.370" end="00:20:56.710" style="s2">talked about the virtual Exodus the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.550" end="00:20:58.990" style="s2">that people more and more are stating</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.710" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">that they prefer the virtual world the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.990" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">world of video games rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:05.710" style="s2">real world so you get books entitled the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:09.160" style="s2">virtual Exodus or another book entitled</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.710" end="00:21:12.040" style="s2">reality is broken and ask yourself why</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.160" end="00:21:14.560" style="s2">do people want to go in to these virtual</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.040" end="00:21:15.970" style="s2">worlds why do they prefer them well one</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.560" end="00:21:18.790" style="s2">of the things that video games reliably</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:23:04.300" style="s2">is becoming pervasive in our society so</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.270" end="00:23:05.830" style="s2">what is meaning in the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.300" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">what are we talking about first of all</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.830" end="00:23:12.430" style="s2">we&#39;re using meaning as and as a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:14.350" style="s2">meaning properly applies to sentences</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.430" end="00:23:15.430" style="s2">and so you know there&#39;s jokes about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.350" end="00:23:17.650" style="s2">well you know what&#39;s the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.430" end="00:23:22.570" style="s2">Oh 42 or something like that right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.650" end="00:23:26.830" style="s2">the idea is there&#39;s sentences have this</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.570" end="00:23:29.640" style="s2">kind of they have a coherence that fits</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.830" end="00:23:32.830" style="s2">me and the world together when I say</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.640" end="00:23:34.810" style="s2">something true whatever true is so</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.830" end="00:23:36.930" style="s2">there&#39;s the idea that there&#39;s a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.810" end="00:23:41.340" style="s2">in sentences</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.930" end="00:23:42.900" style="s2">that connects me to reality so what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.340" end="00:23:47.480" style="s2">would the metaphor be there&#39;s a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.900" end="00:23:51.030" style="s2">a way of living that connects me to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.480" end="00:23:52.890" style="s2">reality and but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.840" end="00:24:58.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen that this meaning has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.340" end="00:25:03.660" style="s2">to do with a fording agency that is</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.840" end="00:25:35.400" style="s2">seeking so I want to turn to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.900" end="00:25:37.020" style="s2">cognitive science and I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.400" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">get at something a meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.020" end="00:25:41.490" style="s2">explicate s&#39; integrates and helps to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:43.260" style="s2">explain all these features and what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.490" end="00:25:45.510" style="s2">want to propose to you is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.260" end="00:25:47.730" style="s2">draw together making sense a Janina fit</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.510" end="00:25:49.770" style="s2">intelligibility and deep significance</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.730" end="00:25:50.380" style="s2">with a particular proposal that&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.770" end="00:25:52.030" style="s2">heart of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.380" end="00:25:53.170" style="s2">this is the idea that this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.030" end="00:25:56.190" style="s2">meaning the meaning that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.170" end="00:26:02.560" style="s2">meaning in life is relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.190" end="00:26:04.900" style="s2">okay so all of that what I just talked</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.560" end="00:26:07.060" style="s2">about you know solving problems goals</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.900" end="00:26:09.130" style="s2">intelligibility all of this making sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.060" end="00:26:11.350" style="s2">all of this comes together in the notion</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.130" end="00:26:12.820" style="s2">of intelligence a very fraught notion no</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.350" end="00:26:15.730" style="s2">doubt but I want to talk about how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.820" end="00:26:18.040" style="s2">actually study and test for intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.730" end="00:26:21.100" style="s2">we study and test for intelligence by</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.040" end="00:26:23.470" style="s2">giving people problems and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.100" end="00:26:25.780" style="s2">take a look at the cognitive science of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.470" end="00:26:27.880" style="s2">intelligence as a way this sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.780" end="00:26:30.910" style="s2">it won&#39;t connect but it will as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.880" end="00:26:34.120" style="s2">trying to get deeper into the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.910" end="00:26:36.130" style="s2">machinery that&#39;s going on in the way the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.120" end="00:26:40.000" style="s2">kind of meaning we&#39;re making when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.130" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">making meaning in life okay so first of</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.000" end="00:26:46.630" style="s2">all let&#39;s consider a contrast what kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:48.100" style="s2">of problem solver you are okay so whose</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.630" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">two problem solvers here&#39;s a vending</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.100" end="00:26:51.400" style="s2">machine this is a special-purpose</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:53.950" style="s2">machine it can sort of solve a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.400" end="00:26:57.060" style="s2">limited set of problems in a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.950" end="00:27:00.190" style="s2">limited domain and here&#39;s a girl and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.060" end="00:27:01.480" style="s2">she&#39;s a general problem solver I I like</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.190" end="00:27:03.310" style="s2">this slide because I don&#39;t quite know</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.480" end="00:27:06.100" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here she&#39;s talking to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.310" end="00:27:08.350" style="s2">her classmates the teacher is writing</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.100" end="00:27:11.470" style="s2">some sort of math equations and then to</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.350" end="00:27:13.330" style="s2">the left of her as the word God so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.470" end="00:27:14.950" style="s2">don&#39;t quite know what&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.330" end="00:27:17.740" style="s2">but it points to something really</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.950" end="00:27:20.530" style="s2">important about you you are a general</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.740" end="00:27:23.260" style="s2">salt problem solver you can solve a wide</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.530" end="00:27:24.610" style="s2">variety of problems in a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.260" end="00:27:26.410" style="s2">domains you can learn how to swim</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.610" end="00:27:27.700" style="s2">you can learn how to play tennis you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.410" end="00:27:29.410" style="s2">learn how to do math you can learn how</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.700" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">to talk about God you can learn to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.410" end="00:27:37.170" style="s2">engage in a conversation you can learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:39.100" style="s2">origami you are a general problem solver</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.170" end="00:27:41.170" style="s2">so one of the ways of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.100" end="00:27:42.580" style="s2">understand intelligence is in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.170" end="00:27:44.650" style="s2">being a general problem solver in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.580" end="00:27:48.070" style="s2">the project in AI is moving from just</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.650" end="00:27:50.950" style="s2">making AI to making a GI artificial</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.070" end="00:27:52.660" style="s2">general intelligence because that is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.950" end="00:27:54.400" style="s2">kind of intelligence that you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.660" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">and it&#39;s the kind of intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.400" end="00:27:59.490" style="s2">the machines so far don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.289" end="00:28:09.059" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s take a look at being a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.489" end="00:28:11.489" style="s2">problem solver okay so a problem is</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.220" end="00:28:27.149" style="s2">then there&#39;s a bunch of things I can do</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.190" end="00:28:35.970" style="s2">I want to put those things I can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.470" end="00:28:38.070" style="s2">together in a sequence that will</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.330" end="00:28:45.149" style="s2">constraints well you don&#39;t want to solve</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.529" end="00:28:46.590" style="s2">any one problem to the exclusion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.149" end="00:28:48.299" style="s2">solving your other problems if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.590" end="00:28:50.369" style="s2">cook my lunch it&#39;s not a good idea to</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.169" end="00:28:55.859" style="s2">right you&#39;d say wow you&#39;re stupid</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.149" end="00:28:57.869" style="s2">because although you cooked your lunch</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.859" end="00:28:59.220" style="s2">you now have created a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.869" end="00:29:03.330" style="s2">other problems for yourself that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.220" end="00:29:05.879" style="s2">didn&#39;t have before okay so a problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.330" end="00:29:07.769" style="s2">solution transforms an initial state</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.879" end="00:29:10.049" style="s2">into the goal State</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.049" end="00:29:16.369" style="s2">problem solving technique is any method</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.019" end="00:29:18.779" style="s2">for finding such a problem solution</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.369" end="00:29:20.730" style="s2">intelligence is to have a bunch of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.779" end="00:29:22.889" style="s2">capacity for generating problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.730" end="00:29:26.070" style="s2">techniques let&#39;s go through this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.889" end="00:29:27.989" style="s2">step-by-step now so there&#39;s the goal</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.070" end="00:29:31.080" style="s2">state having my water here&#39;s my initial</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.989" end="00:29:33.210" style="s2">state I don&#39;t have water right and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.080" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">I do I could do one of three things for</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.210" end="00:29:38.369" style="s2">example and then so on and so forth this</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:40.980" style="s2">is called a search space or a problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.369" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">space this lays out all the potential</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.980" end="00:29:44.879" style="s2">pathways between the initial state and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.009" style="s2">the goal state this is what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.879" end="00:29:48.539" style="s2">have to do when you&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.009" end="00:29:50.309" style="s2">artificial intelligence figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.539" end="00:29:51.989" style="s2">the problem space is and how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.309" end="00:29:54.059" style="s2">going to move through it because what</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.989" end="00:29:57.299" style="s2">intelligence is is to search through</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.059" end="00:29:58.649" style="s2">that space and to find a path that takes</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.299" end="00:30:01.049" style="s2">the initial state to the goal State</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.649" end="00:30:02.730" style="s2">now the problem with this diagram is you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.049" end="00:30:05.159" style="s2">have a God&#39;s eye view of it you can see</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.730" end="00:30:07.559" style="s2">it all at once but in real life you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.159" end="00:30:10.499" style="s2">at the green dot looking this way and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.559" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what combination of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.499" end="00:30:18.269" style="s2">actions is going to solve your problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:21.990" style="s2">and you say okay so what well let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.269" end="00:30:25.169" style="s2">a look at this let&#39;s calculate how big</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.990" end="00:30:28.110" style="s2">that search space is so it&#39;s F to the D</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.169" end="00:30:30.929" style="s2">F is the number of options available to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.110" end="00:30:33.750" style="s2">you at any one step and D is the number</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.929" end="00:30:38.730" style="s2">of steps you take is that okay so on</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.750" end="00:30:41.340" style="s2">average right in a chess game on on</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.730" end="00:30:44.639" style="s2">average for each turn there are 30 moves</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:47.759" style="s2">you could do and on average there&#39;s 60</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.639" end="00:30:50.309" style="s2">turns so the number of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.759" end="00:30:56.429" style="s2">pathways you have to check is 30 to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.309" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">power 60 which is 4 point 2 3 9 times 10</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.429" end="00:31:01.139" style="s2">to the 88th now that&#39;s a very big number</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:01.889" style="s2">yes this is called combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.139" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">explosion</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.889" end="00:31:06.899" style="s2">it&#39;s called combinatorial explosion just</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:08.580" style="s2">to give you some comparisons because</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.899" end="00:31:11.009" style="s2">people will say things are but my brain</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.580" end="00:31:11.549" style="s2">is very complex and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.009" end="00:31:13.370" style="s2">neurons</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.549" end="00:31:16.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched science shows yes you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.370" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">but you have a look 10 to the 10 neurons</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.230" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2">which is nowhere near 10 to the 88th you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:22.019" style="s2">said but it&#39;s not the neurons it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.240" end="00:31:23.669" style="s2">number of connections</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.019" end="00:31:25.590" style="s2">that&#39;s very good you&#39;re right the number</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.669" end="00:31:26.309" style="s2">of connections is 5 times 10 to the 14th</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.590" end="00:31:29.129" style="s2">that&#39;s a big number</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.309" end="00:31:36.570" style="s2">you know what it&#39;s nowhere near 10 to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.129" end="00:31:38.190" style="s2">the 88th nowhere near so do you see what</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.570" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">this is what this is showing you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.190" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">calculate your way through this all</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:50.429" style="s2">right so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:52.620" style="s2">fascinates me is and most researchers</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.429" end="00:31:54.990" style="s2">and is how do you avoid common tutorial</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.620" end="00:31:56.909" style="s2">explosion because that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.990" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">happens to you you&#39;re not over here the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.909" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">water is there in the Oh No</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.179" end="00:32:07.419" style="s2">that&#39;s not what happens somehow and this</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.049" end="00:32:08.859" style="s2">is what you can&#39;t do you can&#39;t check the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.419" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">whole space it&#39;s too big even if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.859" end="00:32:12.219" style="s2">used all of your brains and all all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.289" style="s2">your brain and all of the connections in</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.219" end="00:32:15.849" style="s2">your brain they&#39;re dwarfed by that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.289" end="00:32:17.889" style="s2">search space so that&#39;s not what you do</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.849" end="00:32:18.879" style="s2">you can&#39;t check the whole space and this</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.889" end="00:32:22.419" style="s2">is what you do and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.879" end="00:32:24.279" style="s2">fascinates me you huh somehow don&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.419" end="00:32:27.749" style="s2">sounds like a Zenko hen you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.279" end="00:32:31.359" style="s2">intelligently ignore most of the space</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.749" end="00:32:34.539" style="s2">you intelligently ignore it you zero in</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.539" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">you do it like that and you know what</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.789" end="00:32:46.539" style="s2">relevant information and how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.739" end="00:32:47.950" style="s2">it like that can you do it perfectly of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.539" end="00:32:49.719" style="s2">course not I&#39;m gonna show you you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.950" end="00:32:51.609" style="s2">get messed up but here&#39;s the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.719" end="00:32:55.359" style="s2">do it well enough that you&#39;re a general</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.359" end="00:32:58.299" style="s2">came up with this whole search space</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.820" end="00:33:12.999" style="s2">way they used it they made a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.109" end="00:33:14.859" style="s2">between an algorithm and a heuristic an</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.029" end="00:33:27.669" style="s2">algorithms work because for some</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.289" end="00:33:31.479" style="s2">problems the problem space is not very</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.479" end="00:33:35.349" style="s2">for many problems the problem space is</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.489" end="00:33:39.869" style="s2">combinatorial explosive so they said</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.349" end="00:33:43.509" style="s2">what we use is we use heuristics okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.869" end="00:33:46.059" style="s2">because this is their argument if you</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.059" end="00:33:49.029" style="s2">much of the search space that you have</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.039" end="00:34:31.809" style="s2">realization has crunched the problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.929" end="00:34:40.990" style="s2">space down can you then apply logic and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.809" end="00:34:43.779" style="s2">math so instead we use heuristics what</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.990" end="00:34:46.619" style="s2">the heuristics do well their heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.779" end="00:34:49.569" style="s2">right it&#39;s a problem-solving method that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.619" end="00:34:52.029" style="s2">tries to pre specify where you should</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.569" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">look in the problem space right it</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.029" end="00:34:58.420" style="s2">Orient&#39;s you it sort of gives you a rule</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.690" end="00:35:00.970" style="s2">for ignoring most of the search space</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.420" end="00:35:02.559" style="s2">the problem space it pre specifies what</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.970" end="00:35:04.119" style="s2">part of the search space you could look</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.559" end="00:35:05.980" style="s2">for so here&#39;s some heuristics for</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.119" end="00:35:08.829" style="s2">playing chess get your queen out early</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.980" end="00:35:10.210" style="s2">castle control the center board the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.829" end="00:35:13.299" style="s2">problem with that is I can do all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.210" end="00:35:14.740" style="s2">that and still lose and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.299" end="00:35:17.769" style="s2">interesting is how the heuristic works</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.740" end="00:35:19.390" style="s2">it biases my attention it makes me think</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.769" end="00:35:22.269" style="s2">of the word pre-specify it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.390" end="00:35:24.849" style="s2">prejudge what&#39;s going to be relevant it</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.269" end="00:35:26.259" style="s2">prejudices me I was playing chess not</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.849" end="00:35:28.029" style="s2">that long ago with somebody and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.259" end="00:35:29.980" style="s2">were controlling the center board their</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.029" end="00:35:33.720" style="s2">attention was biased that way so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.980" end="00:35:33.720" style="s2">played a peripheral game and beat them</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.430" end="00:35:44.589" style="s2">ok so when you&#39;re using you have to use</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.710" end="00:35:47.140" style="s2">heuristics you can&#39;t use algorithms you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.589" end="00:35:49.390" style="s2">have to use heuristics heuristics make</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.140" end="00:35:51.099" style="s2">you a general problem solver because</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.390" end="00:35:53.500" style="s2">they help you do relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.099" end="00:35:54.779" style="s2">but whenever this is formal proof for</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.220" end="00:36:05.940" style="s2">always risking bias let&#39;s do it ok so</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.940" end="00:36:10.390" style="s2">we&#39;ve all done this right let&#39;s notice</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:31.010" style="s2">right okay so it&#39;s all euphemisms for</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.880" end="00:36:48.530" style="s2">heuristics we use the availability</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.460" end="00:36:50.090" style="s2">heuristic and the representativeness</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.540" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">fall it oh yeah that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.940" end="00:37:11.390" style="s2">what&#39;s the representativeness heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.050" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">the representativeness heuristic is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.390" end="00:37:17.000" style="s2">more prototypical or salient and event</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:18.410" style="s2">is the more probable we think it is so</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.000" end="00:37:22.340" style="s2">when planes crash they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.410" end="00:37:26.390" style="s2">disasters and tragedies they&#39;re highly</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.340" end="00:37:27.830" style="s2">representative it also makes it easy to</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.830" end="00:37:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s also the availability heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.150" end="00:37:34.250" style="s2">see the two heuristics working with each</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.040" end="00:37:36.770" style="s2">other so you can easily remember and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.250" end="00:37:39.710" style="s2">imagine this very prototypical event so</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.770" end="00:37:45.980" style="s2">it must be highly probable it must be</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:37.550" style="s2">that&#39;s not what rationalities about</p>

<p begin="00:39:09.540" end="00:39:17.190" style="s2">meaning I&#39;m still so stick with me okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.540" end="00:39:18.570" style="s2">we want to talk about what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.670" end="00:39:28.040" style="s2">called the mutilated chessboard okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.830" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen the chess boards before yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.040" end="00:39:33.030" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s eight square there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:35.270" style="s2">eight Bros and eight columns so how many</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.030" end="00:39:37.170" style="s2">little squares is there in total</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.270" end="00:39:39.480" style="s2">sixty-four you know how to do this they</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.170" end="00:39:42.390" style="s2">taught you this in grade four okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.480" end="00:39:44.220" style="s2">there&#39;s 64 squares 8 by 8 now if I have</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.220" end="00:39:49.140" style="s2">it will cover two squares you get that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.520" end="00:39:51.540" style="s2">so how many squares do I need to cover</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.140" end="00:39:55.110" style="s2">the 64 so how many dominoes do I need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.540" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">cover the 64 squares 32 because each</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.110" end="00:39:59.790" style="s2">Domino covers two there&#39;s 64 squares and</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.790" end="00:40:05.010" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the problem what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:06.840" style="s2">do is mutilate the chessboard I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.010" end="00:40:09.690" style="s2">to remove those two corner pieces okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.840" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">do you see that so how many little</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.690" end="00:40:17.890" style="s2">squares are left now on the chessboard</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:20.470" style="s2">62 can I cover the 62</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.890" end="00:40:23.830" style="s2">remaining squares without overhang or</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.470" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">overlap with 31 Domino&#39;s you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.830" end="00:40:34.450" style="s2">prove your answers correct so many of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:37.240" style="s2">you are now staring okay</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:33.840" style="s2">let&#39;s do let&#39;s reformulate the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.630" end="00:41:36.310" style="s2">that&#39;s changed the problem formulation</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.310" end="00:41:42.490" style="s2">to get the solution remember modal</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.490" end="00:41:47.290" style="s2">board horizontally or vertically it will</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.310" end="00:41:51.510" style="s2">always cover a block and a white square</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.329" end="00:41:58.249" style="s2">so I need an equal number of black and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.569" end="00:42:01.400" style="s2">white squares in order to apply the</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.249" end="00:42:04.869" style="s2">Domino&#39;s yes do you notice the color of</p>

<p begin="00:42:04.869" end="00:42:09.769" style="s2">they&#39;re the same color so I do not have</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.509" end="00:42:11.900" style="s2">an equal number of black and white</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.769" end="00:42:14.329" style="s2">squares therefore it is impossible to</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.819" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">several let&#39;s say better came up with</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.219" end="00:42:32.749" style="s2">that solution spontaneously notice what</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:34.459" style="s2">happens here I&#39;m trying to show you how</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.719" end="00:42:56.390" style="s2">some reformulations of the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.809" end="00:42:59.809" style="s2">actually breaks that self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.390" end="00:43:02.150" style="s2">allows you to achieve your goals and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.809" end="00:43:03.829" style="s2">reconnects you more deeply what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.150" end="00:43:07.690" style="s2">on and you know it reconnects you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.829" end="00:43:10.309" style="s2">because you have a flash of insight</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.090" end="00:48:08.099" style="s2">jazz is pick up a pattern formulate it</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.700" end="00:48:10.020" style="s2">and then break it and reformulate and</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:22.950" style="s2">mentioned flow is really important</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.460" end="00:48:25.140" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that people get</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.140" end="00:48:32.730" style="s2">the missing meaning in life okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.020" end="00:48:34.670" style="s2">go back to reciprocal narrowing remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.730" end="00:48:36.780" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and addiction yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.670" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">okay so this kind of think it happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.780" end="00:48:43.380" style="s2">to you you have a event that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:44.849" style="s2">emotionally distressing to you and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.380" end="00:48:46.349" style="s2">your brain immediately strives to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.849" end="00:48:47.490" style="s2">predict what&#39;s the probability am I</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.349" end="00:48:49.349" style="s2">going to have another event like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.490" end="00:48:50.790" style="s2">because that&#39;s what your brain is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.349" end="00:48:55.050" style="s2">kind of problem-solving prediction</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.790" end="00:48:59.339" style="s2">machine and so what it does is it starts</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.050" end="00:49:00.839" style="s2">to use all these heuristics it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.339" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">use the representative heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.839" end="00:49:04.859" style="s2">Wow this really stands out to me this</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:06.869" style="s2">bad event that just happens who&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.859" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">probable the availability heuristic oh I</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.869" end="00:49:11.310" style="s2">can imagine this Oh must be probable</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:13.290" style="s2">then you get interact with called</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.310" end="00:49:14.580" style="s2">encoding specificity you tend to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.290" end="00:49:16.440" style="s2">remember things when you&#39;re in the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.580" end="00:49:17.880" style="s2">state in which you learn them so when</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.440" end="00:49:20.099" style="s2">you&#39;re sad you tend to remember sad</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.880" end="00:49:23.070" style="s2">events and it tends to bias you against</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.099" end="00:49:24.690" style="s2">remembering happy events this is help</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.070" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2">this helps you plug into context it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.690" end="00:49:27.089" style="s2">adaptive but you see how it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.400" end="00:49:29.880" style="s2">wrong here</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.089" end="00:49:31.310" style="s2">so the representativeness heuristic and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.880" end="00:49:34.500" style="s2">the availability heuristic are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.310" end="00:49:35.820" style="s2">reinforcing each other and oh it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.500" end="00:49:37.740" style="s2">probable that I&#39;m gonna do this and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.820" end="00:49:39.750" style="s2">I&#39;m remembering more and more sad events</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.740" end="00:49:41.160" style="s2">because I&#39;m sad and those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.750" end="00:49:42.390" style="s2">reinforcing each other and then I fall</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.160" end="00:49:44.369" style="s2">into what&#39;s come from what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.390" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">confirmation bias I tend to only look</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.369" end="00:49:48.540" style="s2">for information that confirms my belief</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:50.550" style="s2">and that increases it so I start to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.540" end="00:49:53.339" style="s2">think oh gee this is gonna be quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.550" end="00:49:55.080" style="s2">probable this negative event and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.339" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">causes anxiety and then when anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.080" end="00:50:00.089" style="s2">does is it really limits it narrows my</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:02.220" style="s2">cognition and then my world starts</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.089" end="00:50:03.270" style="s2">narrowing I see less and less options</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.220" end="00:50:04.589" style="s2">and I actually get worse at</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.270" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">problem-solving and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.589" end="00:50:06.870" style="s2">self-fulfilling prophecy and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:08.610" style="s2">thing is</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.870" end="00:50:11.880" style="s2">back up giving me a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.610" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">fatality of the and I spiral into</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.880" end="00:50:18.990" style="s2">depression do you see that Leo Ferraro</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:20.940" style="s2">and I published this in 2013 we call it</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.990" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">parasitic processing notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.940" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">happening here the dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.680" style="s2">because that&#39;s what the insight is you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.910" end="00:50:31.560" style="s2">don&#39;t do an insight it happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.680" end="00:50:33.510" style="s2">itself organizes the dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.510" end="00:50:37.530" style="s2">which is so adaptive and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:40.100" style="s2">heuristics that are so adaptive work</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.530" end="00:50:42.900" style="s2">together to create this complex</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.100" end="00:50:45.120" style="s2">maladaptive machine that takes up life</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.900" end="00:50:47.100" style="s2">within your mind and sucks life from you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.120" end="00:50:49.860" style="s2">and your attempts to deal with it are</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.100" end="00:50:52.380" style="s2">impotent because you will intervene here</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.860" end="00:50:54.870" style="s2">or here or here and then like a living</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.380" end="00:50:56.460" style="s2">thing it just reorganizes itself and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.870" end="00:51:01.220" style="s2">adapts and you find yourself doing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.460" end="00:51:04.740" style="s2">same thing again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.220" end="00:51:07.050" style="s2">so researchers I believe it was at MIT I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.740" end="00:51:08.490" style="s2">did a more we did this two years before</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.050" end="00:51:12.810" style="s2">them so yay for me</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.490" end="00:51:20.730" style="s2">but that&#39;s actually yeah sorry with MSU</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.810" end="00:51:21.900" style="s2">and MIT that&#39;s actually the diagram but</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.730" end="00:51:24.470" style="s2">we&#39;re at least on the right track and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.900" end="00:51:24.470" style="s2">they predicted it</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.710" end="00:51:28.860" style="s2">that&#39;s parasitic processing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:31.050" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.860" end="00:51:33.120" style="s2">taking up route in you and your</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.050" end="00:51:34.500" style="s2">cognition in a profound way that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.120" end="00:51:35.880" style="s2">find deeply compelling why is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.500" end="00:51:37.890" style="s2">compelling cuz it&#39;s making use of all</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.880" end="00:51:40.410" style="s2">this adaptive machinery that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.890" end="00:51:41.940" style="s2">has wired you to do do this do this but</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.410" end="00:51:44.190" style="s2">it&#39;s the very machinery that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.940" end="00:51:46.110" style="s2">locking you in into reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.190" end="00:51:48.660" style="s2">modal confusion and deep self deception</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.110" end="00:51:53.610" style="s2">that disconnects you from the world so</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.660" end="00:51:56.190" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing we face perennial</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.610" end="00:51:59.580" style="s2">problems of self deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.190" end="00:52:02.040" style="s2">self-destructive behavior because of our</p>

<p begin="00:52:02.040" end="00:52:06.510" style="s2">they aren&#39;t modified by culture I gave</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.560" end="00:52:08.100" style="s2">you an example of capitalism modifying</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.510" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">modal confusion but what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.100" end="00:52:12.690" style="s2">because the very cognitive machinery</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:17.070" style="s2">that makes this intelligently adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.690" end="00:52:19.670" style="s2">also makes us prone to this we face</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.070" end="00:52:21.530" style="s2">perennial problems of self deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.670" end="00:52:23.420" style="s2">destructive disconnection from ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:52:28.220" end="00:52:33.500" style="s2">so cultures across the world have</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.260" end="00:52:44.960" style="s2">in this but notice what you need you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.770" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">need not an insight here or there</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:49.940" style="s2">you need systematic insight that</p>
