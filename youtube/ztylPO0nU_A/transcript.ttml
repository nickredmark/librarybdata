<p begin="00:00:42.270" end="00:00:49.320" style="s2">with a potential solution that is doable</p>

<p begin="00:01:11.960" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">technology one you know I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:19.460" style="s2">might be an interesting discussion all</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.460" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">the other option is to just talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">trust or Dewey more men a project of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">that but we were kind of shaky on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.020" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">at the end the last one so was it it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">wasn&#39;t fully decided how I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.509" style="s2">actually had that much of a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">look at that Facebook group I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">are there they&#39;re looking at existing</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">tools right more so than creating them</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">from seemed like it but it also seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">quite new and the vibe I got is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">trying to solve a lot of the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">problems as we are so there&#39;s proyects</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">seems like a really good sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">collection to people and just that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">whole goal is the same as the gold I got</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">a second is a spork meeting it seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.469" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">like there could be some really good</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">overlap yeah yeah and I was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">us wondering yeah we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:13.030" style="s2">competitive space so it takes me a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">little while to get used to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.030" end="00:02:22.660" style="s2">meeting though yes so I mean this may be</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:25.870" style="s2">another point where we have to like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.660" end="00:02:28.180" style="s2">know because they&#39;re they&#39;re moving on</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.870" end="00:02:30.340" style="s2">soon to be as far as I could tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.180" end="00:02:36.730" style="s2">unaware of anything that we&#39;ve done so</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.340" end="00:02:38.260" style="s2">far or so yeah I did I guess the only</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.730" end="00:02:41.020" style="s2">thing I&#39;m trying to think is make sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.260" end="00:02:44.650" style="s2">that I&#39;m kind of prepared to change</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.020" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">direction as necessary but also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.650" end="00:02:49.450" style="s2">a good chance that what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:51.820" style="s2">won&#39;t actually have the same overlap and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.450" end="00:02:53.830" style="s2">it may not change anything we do yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.820" end="00:02:56.290" style="s2">did see the I think it was the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.830" end="00:02:58.300" style="s2">group of groups which seemed to give the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.290" end="00:03:02.170" style="s2">same sort of vibe as the meta project as</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.300" end="00:03:04.930" style="s2">like the general goal yeah but I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.170" end="00:03:06.610" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re right Pentti in that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.930" end="00:03:08.590" style="s2">think that actually might end up being</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.610" end="00:03:10.330" style="s2">like almost two sides of the same coin</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.590" end="00:03:12.100" style="s2">where they seem to be more focused on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.330" end="00:03:14.620" style="s2">you know existing tech and what can we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:16.690" style="s2">use and well what would watch UAVs and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.620" end="00:03:17.739" style="s2">you talk about and then as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.690" end="00:03:19.540" style="s2">tell we&#39;re trying to solve like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.739" end="00:03:21.790" style="s2">actual project a project how can we</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.540" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">share you know what does cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.790" end="00:03:26.950" style="s2">look like in a world where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:30.070" style="s2">get used to cooperate and not competing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.950" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">and and that whole thing so I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.070" end="00:03:34.600" style="s2">sure we&#39;ll end up stepping on you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:37.799" style="s2">various toes if as we try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.600" end="00:03:41.670" style="s2">who goes where and who&#39;s doing what but</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.799" end="00:03:44.859" style="s2">I&#39;m glad you found that incentive pose</p>

<p begin="00:09:12.110" end="00:09:15.530" style="s2">clear direction I think would be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.340" end="00:09:18.170" style="s2">little bit premature okay but like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.530" end="00:09:21.050" style="s2">start of having people there just like</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.590" end="00:09:52.490" style="s2">based on the name of it I would expect</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.120" end="00:09:55.910" style="s2">it to be multiple things and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.490" end="00:09:57.980" style="s2">that it should almost be like how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.910" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">know a big enterprise company deals with</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.990" end="00:10:14.780" style="s2">creating a system around it like if</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.150" end="00:10:16.370" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to solve this problem</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.370" end="00:10:21.140" style="s2">here&#39;s for each of these five solution</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.620" end="00:10:23.090" style="s2">sits here&#39;s you know the rough score</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.140" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">that we gave and why and then in the end</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.090" end="00:10:27.290" style="s2">you end up with oh this has the highest</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:28.910" style="s2">score seems like the best one and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.290" end="00:10:30.770" style="s2">you can see it is it good enough or not</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.910" end="00:10:35.060" style="s2">and to move forward or we just saying</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.270" end="00:12:22.220" style="s2">kind of overlaps with what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.130" end="00:12:23.900" style="s2">yeah dad I mean I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.900" end="00:12:27.740" style="s2">point in time when it&#39;s basically want</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.910" end="00:12:30.080" style="s2">to do something run with it run with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.740" end="00:12:31.580" style="s2">until it like comes up strongly against</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.080" end="00:12:33.740" style="s2">something else and then pick which one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.580" end="00:12:37.430" style="s2">the best I guess yeah we&#39;re both from</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.740" end="00:12:39.529" style="s2">parallel until I did want to suggest a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.430" end="00:12:41.810" style="s2">conversation so Jubilee I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.529" end="00:12:45.770" style="s2">this would fit in or the idea cafes but</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.810" end="00:12:48.410" style="s2">a couple times we&#39;ve talked about kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.770" end="00:12:51.050" style="s2">of documentation about game being and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.410" end="00:12:53.930" style="s2">stuff like that and specifically Jonelle</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.050" end="00:12:59.420" style="s2">has brought up a concern about making</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.420" end="00:13:05.620" style="s2">like I understand enough of that concern</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:07.970" style="s2">but I haven&#39;t figured out how to phrase</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.620" end="00:13:09.770" style="s2">how to have a conversation about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.970" end="00:13:12.500" style="s2">I&#39;m not even sure what terms to used I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.770" end="00:13:14.390" style="s2">have to go look it up I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.500" end="00:13:17.810" style="s2">that would that fit into the kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.390" end="00:13:19.379" style="s2">game B topics I if we could craft it</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.810" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">into a question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.379" end="00:13:23.999" style="s2">it would fit with the idea cafe but</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:26.039" style="s2">don&#39;t understand Janelle&#39;s stance I like</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.999" end="00:13:27.749" style="s2">I had the conversation with one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.039" end="00:13:29.939" style="s2">Omega groups I think it was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.749" end="00:13:32.249" style="s2">Wednesday one we&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.939" end="00:13:33.569" style="s2">permeable membranes and how like they</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.249" end="00:13:35.789" style="s2">one of the issues at the game be</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.569" end="00:13:38.189" style="s2">Facebook group is that it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.789" end="00:13:41.549" style="s2">either in or you&#39;re out right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.189" end="00:13:43.139" style="s2">and in that way that it&#39;s concrete and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.549" end="00:13:46.199" style="s2">it but it like both doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.139" end="00:13:47.609" style="s2">boundary and does have a boundary and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.199" end="00:13:50.129" style="s2">would need to re-watch the end table to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.609" end="00:13:52.229" style="s2">explain it but like to me that like</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.129" end="00:13:54.899" style="s2">Gabey needs to exist outside of one</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.229" end="00:13:56.879" style="s2">thing at the same time it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.899" end="00:13:58.409" style="s2">confusing without it being concrete like</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.879" end="00:14:00.779" style="s2">without kind of having a calendar of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.409" end="00:14:02.099" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and definitions and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.779" end="00:14:04.259" style="s2">which is kind of what the wiki is trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.099" end="00:14:08.519" style="s2">to do and things are coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.259" end="00:14:10.529" style="s2">kind of coalescing but I need it to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.519" end="00:14:12.689" style="s2">concrete like it&#39;s like how we need the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.529" end="00:14:14.189" style="s2">tools and the tools to be not five</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.689" end="00:14:17.579" style="s2">different people and game be working on</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.189" end="00:14:19.139" style="s2">a very similar project that isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.579" end="00:14:21.659" style="s2">none of them are gonna work because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.139" end="00:14:23.009" style="s2">energy is dissipated and half the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.659" end="00:14:25.829" style="s2">projects are in genell&#39;s and half the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.009" end="00:14:29.069" style="s2">projects are on kira hazardous or</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.829" end="00:14:30.929" style="s2">Kiley&#39;s and like it&#39;s having those</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.069" end="00:14:33.329" style="s2">conversations and the idea is that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.929" end="00:14:35.729" style="s2">having more organization breaks it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.329" end="00:14:38.249" style="s2">I&#39;m like I need organization like</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.729" end="00:14:40.139" style="s2">there&#39;s something there but was there</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.249" end="00:14:43.529" style="s2">the concern provided as to what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.139" end="00:14:45.479" style="s2">want things to be concrete well it she</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.529" end="00:14:50.869" style="s2">she phrased it I&#39;m just not sure that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.479" end="00:14:53.309" style="s2">could read reiterate it and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.869" end="00:14:55.139" style="s2">effectively I didn&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.309" end="00:14:57.299" style="s2">enough to reiterate but I understood it</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.139" end="00:14:59.909" style="s2">I mean part of resilience is not having</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.299" end="00:15:02.269" style="s2">and so the concerns I think is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.909" end="00:15:05.069" style="s2">reducing resilience and creating dogma</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.269" end="00:15:07.919" style="s2">but I think you can have structure I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.069" end="00:15:10.259" style="s2">think you can have suggestions without</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.919" end="00:15:14.459" style="s2">having mandates I think you can have you</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.259" end="00:15:18.029" style="s2">know documentation without dogma so but</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.459" end="00:15:19.499" style="s2">I need to understand better what our</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.029" end="00:15:21.889" style="s2">concerns are to make sure that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.499" end="00:15:26.249" style="s2">get what Jubilee and I would like</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.889" end="00:15:27.569" style="s2">without encroaching into her concerns so</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.249" end="00:15:29.189" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know how to phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.569" end="00:15:31.160" style="s2">maybe we could just approach Joan Allen</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.189" end="00:15:32.629" style="s2">and say it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.160" end="00:15:34.759" style="s2">even take a couple for phrase day we</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.629" end="00:15:36.379" style="s2">heard you say this we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.759" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">it can we have a meeting to discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.379" end="00:15:42.680" style="s2">and we discussion on resilience the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:45.560" style="s2">being too concrete or the space or what</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.680" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">discussions data that I&#39;m recalling were</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.560" end="00:15:49.699" style="s2">before the wiki it&#39;s when people were</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:55.250" style="s2">talking about or maybe it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.699" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">in the wiki video discussion no but at</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.250" end="00:15:58.730" style="s2">some point we were talking as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:00.379" style="s2">onboarding I think the last time I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.730" end="00:16:02.029" style="s2">remember her bringing up was on on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.379" end="00:16:04.370" style="s2">onboarding and that&#39;s they actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.029" end="00:16:07.689" style="s2">decided to not do onboarding based on</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.370" end="00:16:12.470" style="s2">that concern and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.689" end="00:16:14.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit binary I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.470" end="00:16:17.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a way you can do an introduction</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.180" end="00:16:20.779" style="s2">without building Dogma but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.300" end="00:16:24.410" style="s2">understand enough of what the concern</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.779" end="00:16:29.269" style="s2">was to be able to actually write I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.410" end="00:16:31.250" style="s2">engage yeah I was like it&#39;s I would kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.269" end="00:16:33.050" style="s2">of agree that like the initial intro</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.250" end="00:16:35.480" style="s2">maybe shouldn&#39;t be too concrete and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.050" end="00:16:37.720" style="s2">dogmatic but then per project like if</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.480" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">somebody wants to make a really open</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.720" end="00:16:43.459" style="s2">flowy nebulous thing because they feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:45.889" style="s2">like that&#39;s what they should be they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.459" end="00:16:48.529" style="s2">do that it sounds like everyone involved</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.889" end="00:16:51.709" style="s2">so far with together tech is a fan of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.529" end="00:16:52.910" style="s2">being concrete but like adjustable you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.709" end="00:16:55.160" style="s2">know so we started out saying here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.910" end="00:16:58.370" style="s2">what that is oh people don&#39;t agree okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.160" end="00:17:00.889" style="s2">what should this term be yeah okay all</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.370" end="00:17:02.180" style="s2">right that&#39;s the new definition I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.889" end="00:17:03.860" style="s2">think that her discussion had anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.180" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">to do with projects just with game be</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.860" end="00:17:08.600" style="s2">space in general so I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">that her concern would be on a project</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.600" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">basis so for together tech but she</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">seemed but it since some of our together</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:17.900" style="s2">tech ideas are talking about documenting</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:19.339" style="s2">game be like that&#39;s our reason for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.900" end="00:17:21.049" style="s2">participation in the wiki I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.339" end="00:17:23.959" style="s2">make sure I understand that concern</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.049" end="00:17:25.370" style="s2">before we go too far yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.959" end="00:17:27.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a ballad she seems to have put a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.370" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">lot of thought into it yeah I think it</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.559" end="00:17:31.789" style="s2">is important to note like from what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:35.059" style="s2">seeing from what they together tech is</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.789" end="00:17:37.309" style="s2">it&#39;s our best guess as to what game B</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.059" end="00:17:38.840" style="s2">looks like put into practice I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.309" end="00:17:40.159" style="s2">start actually working on okay so how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.840" end="00:17:42.289" style="s2">we collaborate on projects and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.159" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">do this and you need to be concrete cuz</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.289" end="00:17:47.630" style="s2">we&#39;re actually trying to do things as</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:50.899" style="s2">to Peary captaining and you know trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.630" end="00:17:52.370" style="s2">to figure that out we&#39;re gonna be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.899" end="00:17:53.870" style="s2">more than they are because we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.370" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">concrete and that&#39;s something that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.870" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">have to be able to and she&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:00.679" style="s2">in that place like I mean she&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">working on stuff and doing it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.679" end="00:18:05.630" style="s2">also a little bit along from the divine</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.919" end="00:18:07.279" style="s2">I get like oh people will just find</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.630" end="00:18:09.409" style="s2">their people and form things and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.279" end="00:18:11.389" style="s2">nebula sness feel like lead there which</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.409" end="00:18:12.980" style="s2">I both agree with and also as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.389" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">who finds it hard to find my people</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.980" end="00:18:17.029" style="s2">until I found game B it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.380" style="s2">guarantee can we put something a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.029" end="00:18:21.110" style="s2">more concrete where like people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.380" end="00:18:23.090" style="s2">just wishy-washy in this space like wait</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.110" end="00:18:24.889" style="s2">how do I participate how do I like to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.090" end="00:18:26.750" style="s2">able to have an option for onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.889" end="00:18:30.289" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not mandatory to be like</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:42.980" style="s2">accessible to people the better but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.059" end="00:18:45.740" style="s2">think you do for the concrete thing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.980" end="00:18:47.630" style="s2">somewhat the towel that can be named</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.740" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">camping once you&#39;ve named it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">the towel or whatever that saying is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:53.090" style="s2">that it comes up all the time it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:56.539" style="s2">italic we named it&#39;s not the towel and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.090" end="00:18:58.549" style="s2">it&#39;s like yes but that&#39;s not really game</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.539" end="00:18:59.720" style="s2">be like it&#39;s like both yes it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.549" end="00:19:02.690" style="s2">future and no we are never going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.720" end="00:19:05.779" style="s2">obtain it and there are real things we</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.690" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">can be doing to make that the best</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.779" end="00:19:09.500" style="s2">possibility and bring people on board</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:10.850" style="s2">and how do we work with people on board</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.500" end="00:19:14.360" style="s2">and how do we do it with existing</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.850" end="00:19:16.760" style="s2">technique rate new tech and for that not</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.360" end="00:19:19.490" style="s2">to be concrete is going to hurt it worse</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.760" end="00:19:21.320" style="s2">than how I might I might choose a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.490" end="00:19:24.889" style="s2">different word than concrete because</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.320" end="00:19:27.260" style="s2">concrete does imply unchangeable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.889" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">well you just want something specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.260" end="00:19:32.059" style="s2">Breitling down rocks cool it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:35.929" style="s2">that&#39;s really all we want we just what</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.059" end="00:19:38.750" style="s2">it accessible and document it could</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.929" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">change and it can be say this is not you</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.750" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">know this is not an end-all beyond and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:46.940" style="s2">maybe that should be the first rule</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:53.779" style="s2">right before rule Omega is we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.940" end="00:19:57.630" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing it subjective eternally</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.779" end="00:20:01.090" style="s2">under construction something like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.630" end="00:20:02.860" style="s2">Chiz oh yeah the frustration I have felt</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.090" end="00:20:04.870" style="s2">with not being able to get my idea down</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:06.669" style="s2">on like a white paper and get it out</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.870" end="00:20:09.070" style="s2">into the world has been definitely</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.669" end="00:20:10.779" style="s2">dissipated over like when I see people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.070" end="00:20:11.740" style="s2">white pages and I like can be like well</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.779" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">but this doesn&#39;t work and this works</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.740" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t work like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:18.940" style="s2">together Tech and a big tech cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:20.649" style="s2">that anyone can join is that as people</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.940" end="00:20:22.510" style="s2">join it it shifts and changes completely</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.649" end="00:20:25.029" style="s2">like you know once you have a business</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.510" end="00:20:27.820" style="s2">plan it&#39;s it&#39;s outdated anyway and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.029" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">having something that is like a living</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.820" end="00:20:32.110" style="s2">document whatever that means is evolving</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.600" style="s2">and changing and it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.110" end="00:20:36.429" style="s2">coming participate in it and say what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.600" end="00:20:38.919" style="s2">what it is and that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.429" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">concrete that is like way too nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.919" end="00:20:52.990" style="s2">for people and yet I&#39;m suing for hello</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:58.870" style="s2">yes and finding the I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.990" end="00:20:59.350" style="s2">can hear us whisper when you&#39;re any</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.870" end="00:21:02.169" style="s2">honest</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.350" end="00:21:08.380" style="s2">I had technical difficulties and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.169" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">apparently still have but I did try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.380" end="00:21:17.769" style="s2">catch up with you guys and the life</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:19.510" style="s2">YouTube video stream and so creating</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.769" end="00:21:21.850" style="s2">like what we&#39;re doing here although</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.510" end="00:21:23.769" style="s2">we&#39;re all game B players isn&#39;t game B</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.850" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">right like we&#39;re not even purport it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.769" end="00:21:27.789" style="s2">like very parallel very we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:30.549" style="s2">recreate on me win but like if we fail</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.789" end="00:21:32.500" style="s2">game B doesn&#39;t fail if game B fails we</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.549" end="00:21:34.840" style="s2">don&#39;t fail right like it&#39;s like very</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.500" end="00:21:36.490" style="s2">like we&#39;re creating an omni wind we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.840" end="00:21:38.950" style="s2">using technology we&#39;re getting together</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.490" end="00:21:43.450" style="s2">figuring out how how to get done in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.950" end="00:21:45.070" style="s2">the public eye while like just figure it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.450" end="00:21:47.049" style="s2">all that piece out the messy part all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.070" end="00:21:49.779" style="s2">it so that everyone can see so that even</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.049" end="00:21:52.840" style="s2">if we fail there&#39;s something that comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.779" end="00:21:54.340" style="s2">out of it right like we might be hey</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.840" end="00:21:56.620" style="s2">these three things seem to work those</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.340" end="00:21:58.929" style="s2">two may have been what hunk that project</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.620" end="00:22:00.850" style="s2">yeah cool we&#39;ll take those no everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.929" end="00:22:02.200" style="s2">can have them and then the next group to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.850" end="00:22:05.139" style="s2">try the same thing to the key and learn</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.200" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">from it yeah and maybe I&#39;m thinking as I</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.139" end="00:22:09.410" style="s2">thinking through maybe her goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:12.170" style="s2">keep game be more nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.410" end="00:22:14.690" style="s2">and then the individual projects can</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.170" end="00:22:18.680" style="s2">come at Ghibli just said rise and fall</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.690" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">and regular evolution make sense and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.680" end="00:22:22.340" style="s2">sounds like and I think your point</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:27.260" style="s2">definitely was a strong one where</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.340" end="00:22:29.300" style="s2">concrete is the varying ways people can</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.260" end="00:22:33.050" style="s2">take that will definitely be a point of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.300" end="00:22:35.270" style="s2">like people I think the term I&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.050" end="00:22:36.830" style="s2">in the past is violently agreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.270" end="00:22:40.910" style="s2">each other where it sounds like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.830" end="00:22:45.020" style="s2">arguing is Xperia Lee yeah I violently</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.910" end="00:22:47.990" style="s2">create people out the side yeah sure but</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.020" end="00:22:49.730" style="s2">not quite like that um and I like being</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.990" end="00:22:51.020" style="s2">I like the idea of having it organized</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.730" end="00:22:53.510" style="s2">more so than concrete</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.020" end="00:22:56.180" style="s2">like I want efficient organized without</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.510" end="00:22:59.420" style="s2">it being hierarchical top-down like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.180" end="00:23:01.340" style="s2">just got another lesson this week in one</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.420" end="00:23:06.380" style="s2">of my favorite people has this like me</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.340" end="00:23:08.570" style="s2">too thing happening and and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.380" end="00:23:11.750" style="s2">because he&#39;s the central figure of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.570" end="00:23:13.730" style="s2">entire culture if he goes down the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.750" end="00:23:14.930" style="s2">culture goes down with him like</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.730" end="00:23:16.160" style="s2">especially since it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.930" end="00:23:19.420" style="s2">authenticity he wasn&#39;t being very</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:22.460" style="s2">authentic and so it&#39;s like that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.420" end="00:23:24.350" style="s2">fragile right if Jordan Hall has it has</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.460" end="00:23:25.640" style="s2">a scandal a gym rut has a scandal if</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.350" end="00:23:27.140" style="s2">something like that happens and then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.640" end="00:23:29.390" style="s2">falls apart like that&#39;s not what game be</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.140" end="00:23:31.070" style="s2">as game be is like in the hearts of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.390" end="00:23:32.900" style="s2">minds of a lot of people not just one</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.070" end="00:23:34.430" style="s2">person and yet it is kind of falling</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.900" end="00:23:35.870" style="s2">apart and falling together at the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.430" end="00:23:39.470" style="s2">time it&#39;s like a weird</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.870" end="00:23:41.270" style="s2">it is nebulous and but not to have it be</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.470" end="00:23:42.830" style="s2">a concrete like a project could be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.270" end="00:23:45.140" style="s2">concrete thing at one with one person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.830" end="00:23:49.730" style="s2">vision right and like bringing people on</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.140" end="00:23:52.460" style="s2">board but one thing failing isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.730" end="00:23:54.500" style="s2">make all the other ones fail and owning</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.460" end="00:23:56.090" style="s2">that like making it as resilient as</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.500" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">possible like together tech right like</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.090" end="00:24:00.260" style="s2">how do we keep together tech strong</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:03.230" style="s2">independent of the projects that its</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.260" end="00:24:05.900" style="s2">facilitating right and independent of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.230" end="00:24:08.930" style="s2">game B and this and if it goes down or</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.900" end="00:24:10.610" style="s2">stays up or and I mean the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.930" end="00:24:14.630" style="s2">group specifically which isn&#39;t game B</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.610" end="00:24:19.040" style="s2">but I&#39;m wondering how that nebulosity</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.630" end="00:24:22.730" style="s2">can be also applied to actual projects</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.040" end="00:24:25.570" style="s2">to specific projects like can I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.730" end="00:24:30.620" style="s2">we see how game B in itself is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.570" end="00:24:32.390" style="s2">nebulous thing and it meets that to some</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.620" end="00:24:36.049" style="s2">degree because otherwise it might well</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.390" end="00:24:39.320" style="s2">for about but for projects can they also</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.049" end="00:24:41.330" style="s2">stay nebulous for some time</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.320" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">I&#39;m just really generally wondering</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.330" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">about it right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:51.650" style="s2">I I would say yes and so like you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:53.450" style="s2">want to get more specific and you want</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.650" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">to get more documented but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.450" end="00:24:57.799" style="s2">want to like those guys they have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:25:00.620" style="s2">first statement or claim being we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.799" end="00:25:03.049" style="s2">going to change fast and nothing we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.620" end="00:25:06.590" style="s2">written we&#39;ve written so far as it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.049" end="00:25:10.309" style="s2">should be considered permanent then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.590" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">should probably fight that tendency for</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.309" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">as long as possible at some time at some</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.070" style="s2">point if you&#39;re actually like creating</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:23.690" style="s2">technology or something something&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.070" end="00:25:28.280" style="s2">to solidify but but yeah so nebulous is</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.690" end="00:25:31.490" style="s2">game be especially nowadays with these</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.280" end="00:25:33.650" style="s2">the possibilities of taking all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.490" end="00:25:37.880" style="s2">open source and then forking it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.650" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">creating your own branch of stuff and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.880" end="00:25:41.630" style="s2">does feel like it&#39;s at least getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:43.640" style="s2">more and more also into this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.630" end="00:25:45.350" style="s2">sometimes a little bit nebulous what</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.640" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">this is actually doing you start doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.350" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">something and then people have different</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:54.710" style="s2">ideas and I mean I think if game B is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:57.110" style="s2">the goal then each project is like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.710" end="00:25:59.540" style="s2">think I know how to to get there and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.110" end="00:26:01.309" style="s2">then the challenge is of course that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.540" end="00:26:01.820" style="s2">aren&#39;t all 100% in agreement with what</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.309" end="00:26:05.720" style="s2">the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.820" end="00:26:09.610" style="s2">so it&#39;s which is the fun you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.720" end="00:26:11.510" style="s2">like having like I think tomorrow&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.610" end="00:26:13.370" style="s2">solution raising and it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.510" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">interesting for that very reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.370" end="00:26:16.460" style="s2">like even just the coming up with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">question who like I didn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.460" end="00:26:19.549" style="s2">question I want to offer this question</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">I&#39;m like we are the questions decide</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.549" end="00:26:23.809" style="s2">about and the point isn&#39;t to like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.830" end="00:26:25.370" style="s2">not looking at education breaking it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.809" end="00:26:27.470" style="s2">down into all of its problems sitting</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.370" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">with it for hours and days and years and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.470" end="00:26:30.380" style="s2">like how do we fix it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:32.179" style="s2">literally in an hour we&#39;re coming up</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.380" end="00:26:36.059" style="s2">with a solution that&#39;s a potentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.179" end="00:26:38.899" style="s2">viable solution and so making</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.059" end="00:26:41.009" style="s2">if we ever made it isn&#39;t nebulous or but</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.899" end="00:26:43.409" style="s2">neither is the hour-long conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.009" end="00:26:44.549" style="s2">right it&#39;s like what we&#39;re having we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.409" end="00:26:46.739" style="s2">gonna see how that goes we&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.549" end="00:26:48.690" style="s2">what that process looks like and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.739" end="00:26:51.749" style="s2">hoping people aren&#39;t super attached to</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.690" end="00:26:53.759" style="s2">the idea they create in an hour so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.749" end="00:26:55.289" style="s2">you could have competing hours happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.759" end="00:26:58.169" style="s2">all over the place and therefore pick</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.289" end="00:26:59.700" style="s2">the best one and then work on on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.169" end="00:27:01.349" style="s2">one next right be like okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.700" end="00:27:03.960" style="s2">best one that came out of these 20 hours</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.349" end="00:27:06.269" style="s2">people did and then let&#39;s improve this</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.960" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">one but eventually like a project needs</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.269" end="00:27:09.960" style="s2">to actually be made and it&#39;s broken up</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:11.940" style="s2">into tasks that like into project</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.960" end="00:27:13.950" style="s2">management things get done things get</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.940" end="00:27:16.229" style="s2">paid for and then we have a thing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.950" end="00:27:18.089" style="s2">then it&#39;s like if we fork it it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.229" end="00:27:19.889" style="s2">does that mean right does it does it</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.089" end="00:27:21.659" style="s2">dissipate it how can we fork it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.889" end="00:27:23.190" style="s2">there&#39;s diversity without dissipating</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.659" end="00:27:25.259" style="s2">the energy without dissipating the data</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.190" end="00:27:27.239" style="s2">and there are absolutely ways to do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.259" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">if it&#39;s not everybody off on their own</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.239" end="00:27:30.509" style="s2">right doing their own thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:32.009" style="s2">Britt like you can&#39;t code reason score</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.509" end="00:27:34.049" style="s2">code wiki election and then come</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.009" end="00:27:36.509" style="s2">together and mash them up right but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.049" end="00:27:38.009" style="s2">could as you guys like with that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.509" end="00:27:39.690" style="s2">if you made them and then like in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.009" end="00:27:43.080" style="s2">future I&#39;m a schlub is that part of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.690" end="00:27:46.889" style="s2">we&#39;re doing right like like bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.080" end="00:27:48.690" style="s2">the later earlier like how can we create</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.889" end="00:27:50.309" style="s2">this so they can be brought so or not</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.690" end="00:27:51.629" style="s2">right that like they are independent and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.309" end="00:27:52.919" style="s2">then eventually having the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.629" end="00:27:54.659" style="s2">okay how what could we do to bring this</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.919" end="00:27:58.309" style="s2">data together what could we do so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.659" end="00:28:01.529" style="s2">they&#39;re feeding off each other their</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.309" end="00:28:04.109" style="s2">goals of the co-op council is having</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.529" end="00:28:06.869" style="s2">that conversation is a saying should we</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.109" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">ever like connect our systems if so when</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.869" end="00:28:13.289" style="s2">and why and if not why yeah so talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:14.849" style="s2">about that because exactly like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.289" end="00:28:16.679" style="s2">keeping them separate because they are</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.849" end="00:28:19.109" style="s2">distinct enough that they should ruin</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.679" end="00:28:21.089" style="s2">separate in some cases that might make</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.109" end="00:28:22.619" style="s2">sense from what I&#39;ve heard about written</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.089" end="00:28:24.089" style="s2">score it definitely sounds like there</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.619" end="00:28:26.999" style="s2">could be some overlap and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.089" end="00:28:29.009" style="s2">trying to solve the same problems wiki</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.999" end="00:28:30.089" style="s2">election could focus on the other part</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.009" end="00:28:31.830" style="s2">of the problem is trying to solve and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.089" end="00:28:34.739" style="s2">just use that to technology if it ends</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.830" end="00:28:37.289" style="s2">up being an option yeah yeah I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.739" end="00:28:39.659" style="s2">yeah they can be recombined if while</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.289" end="00:28:41.759" style="s2">they&#39;re being written they&#39;re written</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.659" end="00:28:45.929" style="s2">with that in mind like like you said to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.759" end="00:28:48.690" style="s2">blee yeah but I think part of the goal</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.929" end="00:28:49.830" style="s2">would be to at most like they work</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.690" end="00:28:51.870" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.830" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">but they&#39;re separate enough that if one</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:59.970" style="s2">Falls the whole thing doesn&#39;t have to to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:29:01.860" style="s2">to to fall as well yeah yeah so in in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.970" end="00:29:04.529" style="s2">the community that I&#39;m part of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.860" end="00:29:06.450" style="s2">both tasks that absolutely need to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.529" end="00:29:07.769" style="s2">done sometimes don&#39;t get done and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.450" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">have to figure out how to get done and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.769" end="00:29:13.019" style="s2">then there&#39;s people who do tasks want</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:14.730" style="s2">like the props and the you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.019" end="00:29:16.950" style="s2">mean for doing the tasks but in no way</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.730" end="00:29:18.360" style="s2">needed to get done like it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.950" end="00:29:20.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t need another planter and you made</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.360" end="00:29:21.450" style="s2">a planter right you didn&#39;t need a bench</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.190" end="00:29:23.909" style="s2">and you made a bench like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.450" end="00:29:25.350" style="s2">these things aren&#39;t and so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.909" end="00:29:27.570" style="s2">of what like doing your own individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.350" end="00:29:29.789" style="s2">project could end up being the gold that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.570" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">was needed but it&#39;s more likely gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.789" end="00:29:32.940" style="s2">a bench right like it&#39;s most likely</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:35.639" style="s2">gonna be something that wasn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.940" end="00:29:39.289" style="s2">needed but yeah okay you you did it</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.639" end="00:29:41.370" style="s2">great it&#39;s here and so how to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.289" end="00:29:43.889" style="s2">together figure out what needs to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.370" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">created right and then kind of dole that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.889" end="00:29:46.649" style="s2">out and figure out what you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">created that is awesome how do we bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.649" end="00:29:50.730" style="s2">those together and doing both of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:53.029" style="s2">things simultaneously with people still</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.730" end="00:29:55.889" style="s2">being able to follow their own</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.029" end="00:29:57.870" style="s2">individual and group Drive right like if</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.889" end="00:30:00.090" style="s2">I felt stifled between these meetings</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.870" end="00:30:01.649" style="s2">that I had to like nothing would be</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.090" end="00:30:03.059" style="s2">happening because it would be like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.649" end="00:30:04.409" style="s2">like cool all I have to do is come to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.059" end="00:30:05.940" style="s2">this for an hour and whatever happened</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.409" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">during the week it&#39;s like I get to bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.940" end="00:30:10.950" style="s2">myself to here and I get to do idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:12.960" style="s2">separate and like I get to run with my</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.950" end="00:30:14.760" style="s2">ideas and that feels very empowering</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.960" end="00:30:16.289" style="s2">instead of like oh wait am i step here</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.760" end="00:30:17.580" style="s2">on anyone&#39;s toes I have to have a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.289" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">bit of trust that if I&#39;m stepping on</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.580" end="00:30:20.370" style="s2">someone&#39;s toes they&#39;re gonna tell me</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">right and we&#39;re gonna figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.370" end="00:30:27.960" style="s2">um versus I don&#39;t know versus something</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:29.130" style="s2">like how that tension right the tension</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.960" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">of like wait I worked on this and now</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.130" end="00:30:32.340" style="s2">it&#39;s nobody cares about it how many</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.260" end="00:30:34.019" style="s2">things did I put out there there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.340" end="00:30:36.210" style="s2">crickets that&#39;s kind of part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.019" end="00:30:38.730" style="s2">so you actually have to learn very early</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.210" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">on to do as little work on something as</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.730" end="00:30:41.970" style="s2">possible we&#39;re putting it out there so</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:44.309" style="s2">you&#39;re less attached to it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.970" end="00:30:47.399" style="s2">more willing to have it have it fall</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.309" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">flat or get momentum and have someone</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.399" end="00:30:52.620" style="s2">else take off with it right like all</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:55.169" style="s2">about the same time but that&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.620" end="00:30:56.580" style="s2">to do especially when you you would like</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.169" end="00:30:58.139" style="s2">me like to sit in your room and create</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.580" end="00:30:59.610" style="s2">something from the ground up and be like</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.139" end="00:31:01.559" style="s2">oh this is great I want to play with</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.610" end="00:31:03.280" style="s2">this but it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.559" end="00:31:04.690" style="s2">thing it&#39;s only nebulous unless</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.280" end="00:31:07.060" style="s2">other people can come on board and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.690" end="00:31:08.890" style="s2">understand it right and we do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.060" end="00:31:11.140" style="s2">process together seems a bit like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.890" end="00:31:11.980" style="s2">sort of I mean it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.140" end="00:31:13.630" style="s2">pre-project</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.980" end="00:31:16.230" style="s2">or you could say it&#39;s very early stages</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.630" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">of the meta project where it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.230" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">verifying the need because you can say</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:21.160" style="s2">that it has a cool idea and then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.280" style="s2">show it to the world and people just</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.160" end="00:31:25.990" style="s2">don&#39;t care then I mean you can move</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.280" end="00:31:29.410" style="s2">forward if you want but you might not</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.990" end="00:31:31.540" style="s2">get gain much traction but it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.410" end="00:31:33.640" style="s2">the opposite we&#39;re if also if you show</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.540" end="00:31:34.900" style="s2">it to something and they you know people</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.640" end="00:31:36.310" style="s2">are super psyched you&#39;re like all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.900" end="00:31:38.830" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good sign that we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.310" end="00:31:41.500" style="s2">move forward with this and if it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:32.280" style="s2">so far</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.369" end="00:35:42.210" style="s2">session I think maybe they had to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.740" end="00:35:44.190" style="s2">it&#39;s been around for a while I think the</p>

<p begin="00:35:44.190" end="00:35:48.450" style="s2">board has been around for a while I</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.720" end="00:35:51.270" style="s2">think a brown the september/october may</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.450" end="00:35:52.680" style="s2">be November and it doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.270" end="00:35:54.450" style="s2">used too much and that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.680" end="00:35:56.910" style="s2">problem with it like everything&#39;s paid</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.450" end="00:35:58.140" style="s2">everything&#39;s like if I&#39;m like this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.910" end="00:35:59.910" style="s2">the issue with everyone trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.140" end="00:36:01.500" style="s2">their own problem is that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.910" end="00:36:03.029" style="s2">problems actually get solved it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.500" end="00:36:05.430" style="s2">I&#39;m an individual and I want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.029" end="00:36:06.660" style="s2">to access Trello without paying $10 like</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.430" end="00:36:09.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like that you have to pay 6 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.660" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">per contributor so therefore wordy at 24</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.450" end="00:36:13.289" style="s2">with us right like for us to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.089" style="s2">have a Trello board that&#39;s useful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.289" end="00:36:16.710" style="s2">like these things need to recreate it so</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.089" end="00:36:18.329" style="s2">that like or Google could recreate them</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.710" end="00:36:20.430" style="s2">if Google wants to create Trello so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.329" end="00:36:24.029" style="s2">it&#39;s in G Drive I&#39;m good and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.430" end="00:36:25.859" style="s2">like crate from there so I think as</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.029" end="00:36:28.970" style="s2">strong as as long as the Trello boards</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.859" end="00:36:28.970" style="s2">open I think it&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.430" end="00:36:34.380" style="s2">there also is and did this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:35.730" style="s2">for game B that this has to be a super</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.380" end="00:36:37.260" style="s2">common thing but where people are trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.730" end="00:36:39.539" style="s2">to solve problems before it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.260" end="00:36:41.160" style="s2">solve them like where it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.539" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">make sure that we you know that okay we</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.160" end="00:36:45.660" style="s2">can scale up to a thousand people before</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:47.700" style="s2">we have five and actually can start to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.660" end="00:36:49.950" style="s2">ask people like wait did what features</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.700" end="00:36:52.109" style="s2">do we want are people okay with paying</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.950" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">six dollars a month like those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.109" end="00:36:59.099" style="s2">things and that&#39;s like when it came to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:37:01.020" style="s2">working on the like the member system</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.099" end="00:37:02.250" style="s2">for the projects and you know and be</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.250" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">maybe people being able to help even</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.950" end="00:37:08.250" style="s2">with that up might seems like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:10.230" style="s2">we&#39;re going overkill first we should</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.250" end="00:37:12.690" style="s2">find you know 10 projects that want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.230" end="00:37:15.660" style="s2">participate in ten people just have you</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.690" end="00:37:16.890" style="s2">know solve it in the simplest way like</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.660" end="00:37:19.319" style="s2">without software just you know a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.890" end="00:37:22.140" style="s2">facebook chat or something and then once</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.319" end="00:37:24.359" style="s2">you get that very small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.140" end="00:37:27.089" style="s2">then start to look at like okay so are</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.359" end="00:37:28.589" style="s2">we okay with this system here&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.089" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">questions that have about the three or</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.589" end="00:37:33.319" style="s2">four routes that we could go what does</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:33.319" style="s2">everyone think</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.119" end="00:37:48.740" style="s2">a good thing to do with the people they</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.740" end="00:37:50.390" style="s2">that commented on the like we have 10</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.740" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">projects that people have filled out for</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.390" end="00:37:54.769" style="s2">the is to just create a Facebook the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:56.390" style="s2">issues we asked them for their emails</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.769" end="00:37:57.650" style="s2">and not their facebook Messenger but</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.390" end="00:37:59.660" style="s2">Facebook Messenger is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.650" end="00:38:01.519" style="s2">easiest so that it is like hey who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.660" end="00:38:05.089" style="s2">with your project that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.519" end="00:38:06.589" style="s2">dinging though a lot of notifications</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.089" end="00:38:08.329" style="s2">but having a space to be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.589" end="00:38:11.720" style="s2">here&#39;s my project here&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.329" end="00:38:13.970" style="s2">maybe we make a because it&#39;s not as long</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.720" end="00:38:16.069" style="s2">as we make either I think Jim or Janelle</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.970" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">the one of the amends we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.069" end="00:38:20.539" style="s2">game be project Facebook group that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:22.069" style="s2">one of the meta projects right that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.539" end="00:38:24.170" style="s2">one of them like I specifically bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.069" end="00:38:27.559" style="s2">your project here if it&#39;s in any way</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.170" end="00:38:30.259" style="s2">game be right even a tiny bit and so and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.559" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">then coordinate that and like we totally</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.259" end="00:38:36.319" style="s2">look like a project you know a game be</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:38.390" style="s2">project board or job board or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.319" end="00:38:40.190" style="s2">you want to call it or yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.390" end="00:38:42.829" style="s2">great it&#39;s on Facebook it&#39;s not super</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.010" end="00:46:35.829" style="s2">interesting like I think once we get a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.280" end="00:46:37.780" style="s2">Facebook page up and going a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.829" end="00:46:39.250" style="s2">is gonna be like popsicle sticks and</p>

<p begin="00:46:39.250" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">sticky you know sticky comments and sigh</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.190" end="00:46:45.970" style="s2">panel thing is what we&#39;re like hey</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.730" end="00:46:58.359" style="s2">working on things or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.770" end="00:46:59.770" style="s2">number ends up being we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.359" end="00:47:04.060" style="s2">look at like alright let&#39;s actually do</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.770" end="00:47:05.589" style="s2">this well what is that look look look</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.060" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">looks like because right now I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.589" end="00:47:11.410" style="s2">step one is just get people the irony</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:13.810" style="s2">also is that like the game be Facebook</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.700" end="00:47:25.869" style="s2">here like it&#39;s like that&#39;s important so</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.710" end="00:47:28.359" style="s2">having one that is projects so people</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.869" end="00:47:30.220" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily need to post in them</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.359" end="00:47:32.890" style="s2">in the major one but like people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.220" end="00:47:35.589" style="s2">want a facility yeah that also gives</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.890" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">them more useful response to people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.589" end="00:47:39.430" style="s2">are posting project stuff in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:41.890" style="s2">like no no no good go go do that here</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.430" end="00:47:43.569" style="s2">it&#39;s not saying to don&#39;t do it saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.890" end="00:47:45.220" style="s2">great that&#39;s cool you have a project</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.569" end="00:47:47.140" style="s2">other people who also have projects and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.220" end="00:47:50.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a space for it go over here and</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.140" end="00:47:51.609" style="s2">there&#39;s you know appropriate sticky</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.079" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">comments and pinned things and all that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.609" end="00:48:00.220" style="s2">jazz so we think that game B projects is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:01.720" style="s2">that yeah I think for the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.220" end="00:48:05.069" style="s2">thing and then like we need a tagline</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.720" end="00:48:07.480" style="s2">for like what actually it is which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.069" end="00:48:10.660" style="s2">better than but like basically bring</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.480" end="00:48:12.339" style="s2">your project and let&#39;s co-create Omni</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.660" end="00:48:14.740" style="s2">win solutions that help our projects get</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.339" end="00:48:16.450" style="s2">off the ground right and deal with</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.740" end="00:48:20.380" style="s2">everything that comes up pops the six</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.450" end="00:48:23.230" style="s2">igloo guys and this truly it like</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.380" end="00:48:25.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a decent chance that you know in</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.230" end="00:48:26.349" style="s2">a year or two we rename this channel</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.000" end="00:48:28.119" style="s2">together tech because it&#39;s solving the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.349" end="00:48:30.700" style="s2">like it&#39;s serving the exact same purpose</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.119" end="00:48:32.500" style="s2">of being that like multi project</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.700" end="00:48:35.170" style="s2">facilitator trying to you know find</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.500" end="00:48:36.609" style="s2">common things if that it&#39;s just together</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.170" end="00:48:38.220" style="s2">tech doesn&#39;t mean anything yet so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.609" end="00:48:39.780" style="s2">gonna say it&#39;s game V projects</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.220" end="00:48:40.890" style="s2">and try to figure that out answer</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.780" end="00:48:42.510" style="s2">questions and if we come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.890" end="00:48:43.109" style="s2">different name in the meantime that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.510" end="00:48:46.500" style="s2">works too</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.109" end="00:48:48.690" style="s2">but because part of it was with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.500" end="00:48:50.430" style="s2">project member portal it was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.690" end="00:48:52.770" style="s2">planning on having together tech just be</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.430" end="00:48:54.510" style="s2">one of the projects but now it is sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.770" end="00:48:56.340" style="s2">of that like the thing the layer on top</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.510" end="00:49:00.030" style="s2">of all of it which makes sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.340" end="00:49:02.010" style="s2">being that group a different name cool</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.030" end="00:49:04.109" style="s2">and then as people join that are like</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.010" end="00:49:05.609" style="s2">not game B but gate B then yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.109" end="00:49:07.170" style="s2">becomes more about do you have a project</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.609" end="00:49:09.570" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t have a mission it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.170" end="00:49:11.580" style="s2">both people with who are game be people</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.570" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">who have projects and people who&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.660" end="00:49:19.800" style="s2">of brings those like I know like I said</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.460" end="00:49:22.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if Syed is um one if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.800" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">saying his name right and two if he his</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.080" end="00:49:26.670" style="s2">project if he&#39;s involved in getting B at</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:28.560" style="s2">all I don&#39;t know how he found us I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.670" end="00:49:30.030" style="s2">know who knows but like that&#39;s the joy</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.560" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">of this is like you boy like I have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.030" end="00:49:33.720" style="s2">world-changing project look at it right</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:36.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s no people like that that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.720" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s an interesting point if</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.119" end="00:49:42.599" style="s2">people don&#39;t know about game B if we</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:44.660" style="s2">call this game B projects is that going</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.599" end="00:49:47.640" style="s2">to be confusing is there going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.660" end="00:49:49.260" style="s2">limiting do you know it is project you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.640" end="00:49:51.390" style="s2">do we call I don&#39;t know like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.260" end="00:49:52.680" style="s2">sure what a better term might be but do</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.390" end="00:49:55.020" style="s2">we want something that&#39;s a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.680" end="00:49:57.240" style="s2">descriptive because uh uh as you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.020" end="00:49:58.260" style="s2">give me projects and you have to go fall</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.240" end="00:50:02.040" style="s2">down a rabbit hole for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.260" end="00:50:03.270" style="s2">figuring out but what is game B I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.040" end="00:50:08.130" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.270" end="00:50:10.080" style="s2">that&#39;s we do want it to be in that game</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.130" end="00:50:16.490" style="s2">B space not necessarily in the game B</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.080" end="00:50:19.670" style="s2">group space but it is a game B style</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.490" end="00:50:22.349" style="s2">project and then if people want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.670" end="00:50:24.510" style="s2">participate in that they should know</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.349" end="00:50:27.180" style="s2">what game B is and what game B is trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.510" end="00:50:29.460" style="s2">to achieve I guess we can also take a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.180" end="00:50:32.010" style="s2">stab at like a really high level you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.460" end="00:50:33.810" style="s2">know one paragraph like well what is a</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.440" end="00:56:34.569" style="s2">really super burly yeah way too early</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:37.450" style="s2">not even stay up late early like very</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.569" end="00:56:39.369" style="s2">early and so but I am looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.450" end="00:56:40.989" style="s2">it cuz it&#39;s not even about getting this</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.369" end="00:56:43.089" style="s2">solution it&#39;s about figuring out the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.989" end="00:56:44.380" style="s2">process to like make that fun and get</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.089" end="00:56:46.509" style="s2">the solution and if we come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.380" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">solution awesome and my rigid</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.509" end="00:56:50.859" style="s2">timekeeping we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see how well</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.400" end="00:56:52.809" style="s2">that goes 15 minutes 15 minutes 30</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.859" end="00:56:56.200" style="s2">minutes for the actual solution and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.809" end="00:56:57.009" style="s2">like but a Toro and Bentley you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.200" end="00:56:59.859" style="s2">coming right</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.009" end="00:57:01.420" style="s2">I believe Janelle might be coming and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.859" end="00:57:07.380" style="s2">think Eric as well who was here last</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.420" end="00:57:11.289" style="s2">week awesome cool nice week on mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.380" end="00:57:13.779" style="s2">so having a discussion like that it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.289" end="00:57:15.700" style="s2">be we find it will be hard like because</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.779" end="00:57:17.890" style="s2">eric has an idea for education already</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.700" end="00:57:19.390" style="s2">like his like any morning so it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.890" end="00:57:21.430" style="s2">that and like I have an idea for</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.390" end="00:57:23.380" style="s2">everything but it&#39;s like not holding too</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.430" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">tightly to like my idea has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.380" end="00:57:27.729" style="s2">thing you have at the end it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:29.380" style="s2">candor needing to talk like it&#39;s like 15</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.729" end="00:57:31.180" style="s2">minutes and maybe everyone can&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.380" end="00:57:33.579" style="s2">with the problem with education is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.180" end="00:57:35.319" style="s2">letting like the the conversation be</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.579" end="00:57:37.540" style="s2">alive in and of itself or even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.319" end="00:57:39.130" style="s2">not the one participating it&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.540" end="00:57:40.420" style="s2">that&#39;s created by the end it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.130" end="00:57:41.710" style="s2">that&#39;s an actual possible thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.420" end="00:57:42.660" style="s2">none of us could have created by</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.710" end="00:57:45.250" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.660" end="00:57:48.849" style="s2">it was straight an hour of time also</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.250" end="00:57:51.880" style="s2">useful to be explicit in both expecting</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.849" end="00:57:54.040" style="s2">that and like acknowledging it like sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.880" end="00:57:55.960" style="s2">of saying you like your idea and how</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.040" end="00:57:58.030" style="s2">that&#39;s affecting you I mean not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.960" end="00:57:59.950" style="s2">will be comfortable on that but almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.030" end="00:58:01.750" style="s2">saying that from the get-go like hey</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.950" end="00:58:03.160" style="s2">people are gonna be coming in this with</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.750" end="00:58:05.260" style="s2">their own idea people tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.160" end="00:58:07.780" style="s2">defensive of their ideas so whenever</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.260" end="00:58:09.640" style="s2">possible let&#39;s you know pretty admit or</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.780" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">even at the end saying like oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.640" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">we came up with this idea I like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:16.930" style="s2">fact you know that this sliver of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:18.700" style="s2">here I I think sort of branched off of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.930" end="00:58:20.530" style="s2">this conversation you know that came</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.700" end="00:58:22.630" style="s2">from my ideas so I feel comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.530" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">it like my fingerprint is on there</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.630" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">somewhere yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:29.050" style="s2">like honestly just being part of it you</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:30.579" style="s2">created it and then even just like I</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.050" end="00:58:32.020" style="s2">said later on when there&#39;s multiple ones</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.579" end="00:58:34.270" style="s2">going on and they&#39;re competing with each</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.020" end="00:58:35.530" style="s2">other it&#39;s like yes you got to</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.270" end="00:58:36.970" style="s2">participate in that you still made it</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.530" end="00:58:38.470" style="s2">better like yours wasn&#39;t chosen this</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.970" end="00:58:40.660" style="s2">week but like did you enjoy the thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.470" end="00:58:41.950" style="s2">right did you enjoy participating and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.660" end="00:58:43.900" style="s2">creating something cuz you also created</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.950" end="00:58:45.670" style="s2">something it wasn&#39;t created beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.900" end="00:58:46.690" style="s2">and it&#39;s seen what all these different</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.670" end="00:58:48.730" style="s2">ones create and then how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.690" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">expressed and how yeah but right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.730" end="00:58:52.869" style="s2">it&#39;s just one one conversation one hour</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:55.089" style="s2">and some people their role might just be</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.869" end="00:58:58.660" style="s2">to poke holes and that&#39;s still insanely</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.089" end="00:59:00.010" style="s2">valuable yeah I like I didn&#39;t create it</p>

<p begin="00:59:00.010" end="00:59:03.210" style="s2">happening that would have been bad</p>

<p begin="00:59:06.010" end="00:59:14.380" style="s2">educating them was not the thing we</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.930" end="00:59:15.730" style="s2">wanted to have happen oh that&#39;s not God</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.380" end="00:59:19.089" style="s2">sound like good idea could see some</p>
