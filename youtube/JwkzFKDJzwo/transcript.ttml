<p begin="00:00:45.170" end="00:00:55.070" style="s2">I guess I&#39;m on my son isn&#39;t here tonight</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.010" end="00:00:59.179" style="s2">so I&#39;m doing this in my relatively</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.070" end="00:01:00.649" style="s2">technologically clueless manner there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.179" end="00:01:01.159" style="s2">one thing I&#39;ve noticed about getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.649" end="00:01:05.030" style="s2">older</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.159" end="00:01:08.990" style="s2">I have kept up with computer technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.030" end="00:01:11.149" style="s2">pretty well I would say but I do find</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.990" end="00:01:12.710" style="s2">maybe because of the demands on me in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.149" end="00:01:14.119" style="s2">the last year maybe I&#39;m not stupider</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.710" end="00:01:18.050" style="s2">it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.119" end="00:01:19.610" style="s2">so anyways hi everyone nice to see you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.050" end="00:01:23.690" style="s2">here looks like I&#39;ve got the chat</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.690" end="00:01:29.709" style="s2">it all right so I&#39;m going to start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.259" end="00:01:32.270" style="s2">some questions that people sent me</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.709" end="00:01:34.759" style="s2">anyways thank you for all be for all you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.270" end="00:01:38.690" style="s2">you for being here by the way it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.759" end="00:01:40.729" style="s2">much appreciated it&#39;s quite remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.690" end="00:01:42.850" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned that you tuned</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.729" end="00:01:46.039" style="s2">in to listen to me talk with you I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.850" end="00:01:47.209" style="s2">definitely do appreciate it so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.039" end="00:01:48.830" style="s2">to start with some of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.209" end="00:01:52.509" style="s2">people sent me earlier and I&#39;ll keep an</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.830" end="00:01:54.590" style="s2">eye on the chat YouTube chat as well so</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.509" end="00:01:57.219" style="s2">hopefully the audio is good what about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.590" end="00:02:02.060" style="s2">that how&#39;s the audio there guys</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.219" end="00:02:07.310" style="s2">so now Adam W Patterson asked me a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.060" end="00:02:09.259" style="s2">question that got 410 votes he said I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.310" end="00:02:11.150" style="s2">a web software developer are you hiring</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.259" end="00:02:13.160" style="s2">or can I volunteer for anything I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.150" end="00:02:15.170" style="s2">build anything I can automate things I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.160" end="00:02:17.269" style="s2">could simply be an assistant of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.170" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">thank you for your time well what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.269" end="00:02:21.620" style="s2">would like to say about that is first</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:24.049" style="s2">Thank You Adam it&#39;s much appreciated and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.620" end="00:02:27.100" style="s2">a lot of people have volunteered their</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.049" end="00:02:30.829" style="s2">time to me and their and their</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.100" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">technological expertise and as much as</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.829" end="00:02:34.510" style="s2">I&#39;d like to make use of it that simple</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.950" style="s2">truth of the matter is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.510" end="00:02:39.079" style="s2">sufficiently overwhelmed by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.950" end="00:02:40.880" style="s2">complexity of my life at the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.079" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to undertake a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.880" end="00:02:46.069" style="s2">collaborative project with anyone I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:51.950" style="s2">generally speaking before all this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.069" end="00:02:53.870" style="s2">political what would you call it before</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.950" end="00:02:56.180" style="s2">all these political events overtook my</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.870" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">life I was already scheduled probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.180" end="00:02:59.990" style="s2">about six months to a year</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:02.120" style="s2">you know all my time was already eaten</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.990" end="00:03:03.860" style="s2">up and of course the addition of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.120" end="00:03:06.530" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happened in the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.860" end="00:03:10.700" style="s2">year - that has occupied my time to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.530" end="00:03:14.930" style="s2">degree that is was is really somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.700" end="00:03:17.630" style="s2">unimaginable and so I just can&#39;t take on</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.930" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">additional help which is so strange</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.630" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">because you think that help is help and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:22.730" style="s2">that it would save time but you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:24.500" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.730" end="00:03:26.750" style="s2">collaborative relationship with someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.500" end="00:03:31.340" style="s2">and especially if you want to give them</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.750" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">credit and do things properly so at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.340" end="00:03:36.290" style="s2">moment I&#39;m afraid that I can&#39;t entertain</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:37.730" style="s2">any such offers even though I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.290" end="00:03:40.250" style="s2">and there may come a time in the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.730" end="00:03:42.170" style="s2">especially when I&#39;m hopefully starting</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.250" end="00:03:44.989" style="s2">to work more on this online university</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.170" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">project I&#39;ve got a few projects to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.989" end="00:03:48.350" style="s2">finish up before that the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.610" end="00:03:51.260" style="s2">personality test which we&#39;ve just about</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.350" end="00:03:53.209" style="s2">dawdled bugs worked out of and also the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:55.069" style="s2">high school version of the Future</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.209" end="00:03:57.230" style="s2">authoring program are all we&#39;re all set</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.069" end="00:03:59.090" style="s2">up long before any of this happened so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.230" end="00:04:00.590" style="s2">have to clear them out before I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.090" end="00:04:02.390" style="s2">concentrate on a new project and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.590" end="00:04:05.810" style="s2">finished a book over the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.390" end="00:04:08.150" style="s2">years - called twelve rules for life an</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.810" end="00:04:10.030" style="s2">antidote to chaos which is now available</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.150" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">by the way if you&#39;re interested on</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.030" end="00:04:17.390" style="s2">Amazon for pre-order and so anyways this</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.290" end="00:04:20.690" style="s2">is my round about way of saying thank</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.390" end="00:04:22.700" style="s2">you very much but I can&#39;t accept more</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.690" end="00:04:25.310" style="s2">help at the moment because my time is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.700" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">too restricted to make proper use of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.310" end="00:04:31.669" style="s2">so um plays Noren how to use the results</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:34.039" style="s2">in the new personality test for progress</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.669" end="00:04:38.840" style="s2">in life try to compensate some sites</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.039" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">that that received fewer points well at</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.840" end="00:04:43.039" style="s2">the risk of sounding self-serving that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:45.169" style="s2">actually why we developed the self</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.039" end="00:04:48.229" style="s2">authoring suite was to help people</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.169" end="00:04:49.760" style="s2">improve their let&#39;s say performance and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.229" end="00:04:51.830" style="s2">mental health now we don&#39;t have direct</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.760" end="00:04:54.380" style="s2">evidence that will that will improve</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.830" end="00:04:56.360" style="s2">personality but I suspect that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.380" end="00:04:58.580" style="s2">evidence would take a very long time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.360" end="00:05:00.229" style="s2">accumulate what we do know is that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.580" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">self Arthur and suite especially the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.229" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">future Arthur ensuite helps people helps</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:07.689" style="s2">University students for example stay</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:10.179" style="s2">enrolled in university increases</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.689" end="00:05:12.189" style="s2">the probability of that by about 25% and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.179" end="00:05:14.169" style="s2">increases grade point average by about</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.189" end="00:05:17.279" style="s2">the same and there&#39;s good theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.169" end="00:05:21.610" style="s2">reasons for assuming that writing is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.279" end="00:05:24.369" style="s2">good way of writing about yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.610" end="00:05:26.919" style="s2">about your past and about your future is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.369" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">a good way of catalyzing personality</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.919" end="00:05:31.029" style="s2">transformation because it appears that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:32.409" style="s2">personality the human psyche is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.029" end="00:05:34.329" style="s2">organized at the highest level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.409" end="00:05:37.749" style="s2">abstraction using something like self</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.329" end="00:05:40.569" style="s2">narrative and a well-developed narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.749" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">makes a frame for your life and helps</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.569" end="00:05:44.409" style="s2">you stabilize your negative emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">also experience more positive emotion</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.409" end="00:05:48.459" style="s2">because you only experience positive</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:51.519" style="s2">emotion relationship to a goal and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.459" end="00:05:53.349" style="s2">can make goal-directed activity a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.519" end="00:05:55.719" style="s2">more rewarding so you know it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.349" end="00:05:57.999" style="s2">easier to engage in activities that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.719" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">aren&#39;t intrinsically rewarding if</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.999" end="00:06:01.209" style="s2">they&#39;re linked to something that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">really find important and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.209" end="00:06:04.809" style="s2">if you want to work on your personality</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.459" style="s2">well the first thing you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.809" end="00:06:08.699" style="s2">figure out who it is that you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.459" end="00:06:10.959" style="s2">and then you have to make a plan and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.699" end="00:06:12.879" style="s2">maybe you have to clean up your past as</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.959" end="00:06:15.849" style="s2">well and the self authoring suite was</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.879" end="00:06:17.879" style="s2">designed you know quite carefully in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.849" end="00:06:20.499" style="s2">order to help people do that with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.879" end="00:06:22.629" style="s2">relative minimum of effort not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.499" end="00:06:24.459" style="s2">easy because it&#39;s not but a relative</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.629" end="00:06:27.579" style="s2">minimum minimum of effort compared to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.459" end="00:06:31.089" style="s2">other technologies let&#39;s say and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.579" end="00:06:36.989" style="s2">like long term psychotherapy and to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.089" end="00:06:39.659" style="s2">it cost-effective as well so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.989" end="00:06:42.819" style="s2">mm-hmm another question</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.659" end="00:06:44.289" style="s2">voted out 77 votes Australia is holding</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.819" end="00:06:46.749" style="s2">a plebiscite on whether to legalize gay</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.289" end="00:06:48.759" style="s2">marriage I&#39;m against the yes campaign</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.749" end="00:06:51.099" style="s2">but only because it&#39;s backed by cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.759" end="00:06:53.939" style="s2">Marxists I&#39;m curious to hear your views</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.099" end="00:06:53.939" style="s2">on gay marriage</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.879" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">well I would be against a to of was</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.459" end="00:07:06.279" style="s2">backed by cultural Marxists because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:09.999" style="s2">isn&#39;t clear to me that it will satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.279" end="00:07:12.099" style="s2">the ever increasing what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.999" end="00:07:15.009" style="s2">demand for an assault on traditional</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.099" end="00:07:16.599" style="s2">modes of being now with regards to gay</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.009" end="00:07:19.770" style="s2">marriage specifically that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.599" end="00:07:22.770" style="s2">tough one for me because you know I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.770" end="00:07:22.770" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:32.900" style="s2">I can&#39;t do anything really other than</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:37.800" style="s2">spoke platitudes about it I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.900" end="00:07:41.730" style="s2">unfortunately you know if if the marital</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.800" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">vows are taken seriously then it seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.730" end="00:07:46.620" style="s2">to me that it&#39;s a means whereby gay</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:48.540" style="s2">people could be integrated more</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:50.700" style="s2">thoroughly into standard society and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.540" end="00:07:52.950" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a good thing and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.700" end="00:07:55.320" style="s2">that would decrease promiscuity which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.950" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">a public health problem although</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.320" end="00:07:58.530" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s not limited to gay</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.530" end="00:08:02.820" style="s2">although gay men tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:04.940" style="s2">promiscuous than average probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.820" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">because there&#39;s no women to bind them</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.940" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">with regards to their sexual activity</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.180" end="00:08:15.810" style="s2">the problem is is that it does seem to</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.070" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">me to be part of a wedge and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.810" end="00:08:20.310" style="s2">obvious to me that that legalizing gay</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:22.100" style="s2">marriage has done anything to decrease</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.310" end="00:08:24.210" style="s2">the demands that the radical left</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.100" end="00:08:30.330" style="s2">neo-marxist types are placing on</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:32.370" style="s2">traditional society so those are my</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.330" end="00:08:36.210" style="s2">views I know they&#39;re confused you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.370" end="00:08:39.240" style="s2">because I&#39;m in favor of extending the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.210" end="00:08:40.740" style="s2">bounds of traditional relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.240" end="00:08:42.480" style="s2">people who wouldn&#39;t be involved in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.740" end="00:08:46.550" style="s2">traditional long term relationship but</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.480" end="00:08:48.750" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned about the undermining of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.550" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">traditional modes of being including</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.750" end="00:08:53.160" style="s2">marriage which you know has technically</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:55.140" style="s2">and and historically being a union</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.160" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">between a man and a woman fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.140" end="00:09:02.550" style="s2">for the purpose of raising children in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:04.650" style="s2">stable and and an optimal and stable</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.550" end="00:09:07.740" style="s2">environment so and marriage has already</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.650" end="00:09:09.690" style="s2">taken a fair bit of damage over the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.740" end="00:09:11.730" style="s2">few decades you know poor people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.690" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">increasingly less likely to be married</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.730" end="00:09:15.290" style="s2">and that&#39;s really not good for them as</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:19.230" style="s2">hi I&#39;m currently going through a hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:21.150" style="s2">time as a first-time mom with a nine</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.230" end="00:09:23.610" style="s2">month old I feel depressed and anxious</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.150" end="00:09:25.290" style="s2">and I&#39;m highly neurotic and volatile can</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.610" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">you suggest anything to help me be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.290" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">better mom well you know lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:31.470" style="s2">have a hard time with their nine months</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:33.900" style="s2">old I guess the first question would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.470" end="00:09:34.650" style="s2">are you getting enough sleep do you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.900" end="00:09:36.630" style="s2">enough help</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.650" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">are you eating enough especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.630" end="00:09:40.920" style="s2">morning you know and you&#39;re gonna feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">highly neurotic and volatile too</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.920" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">some degree because well you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:46.589" style="s2">through quite a physiological trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:50.010" style="s2">it&#39;s very demanding to have a newborn</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.589" end="00:09:51.660" style="s2">baby so the best thing I could say not</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.010" end="00:09:53.459" style="s2">knowing you is to make sure that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.660" end="00:09:56.220" style="s2">have people around that you can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.459" end="00:09:58.829" style="s2">about your baby and that you can and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.220" end="00:10:01.860" style="s2">that you can take a break when you need</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.829" end="00:10:03.389" style="s2">to and have someone spell you I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.860" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">that&#39;s often the role that a husband</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.389" end="00:10:08.760" style="s2">plays in the first year of a baby&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:10.260" style="s2">is that he can he&#39;s supposed to watch</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.760" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">the mother to make sure that she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.260" end="00:10:14.250" style="s2">get overwhelmed by the demands of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:17.220" style="s2">baby and so I would hope that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.250" end="00:10:19.170" style="s2">able to ask for support when you need it</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.220" end="00:10:21.480" style="s2">and not to be afraid of asking for</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.170" end="00:10:22.829" style="s2">support especially to get arrest and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.480" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">get something to eat because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.829" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">really important especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:29.940" style="s2">morning other than that I can&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:31.410" style="s2">anything really specific unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.940" end="00:10:35.550" style="s2">given that I don&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.410" end="00:10:37.050" style="s2">the specifics of your situation if it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.550" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">gets out of hand you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.050" end="00:10:40.410" style="s2">should go the other thing I should say</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">is if it gets out of hand you should go</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.410" end="00:10:44.279" style="s2">speak with your with your doctor with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">professional because you might have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.279" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">postpartum depression there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:52.140" style="s2">dispute about whether that exists and as</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:53.130" style="s2">an independent diagnostic entity but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.140" end="00:10:54.660" style="s2">can certainly be physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.130" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">stressed and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.660" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">predisposition to depression then that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:00.390" style="s2">kind of physiological stress and sleep</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:02.190" style="s2">disruption can bring it on</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.390" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">so I would say if it really gets out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.190" end="00:11:06.690" style="s2">hand don&#39;t hesitate to go talk to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:08.430" style="s2">someone professional you know it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.690" end="00:11:10.110" style="s2">may be necessary to do that because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.430" end="00:11:18.570" style="s2">don&#39;t want to fall too far down the hall</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.110" end="00:11:20.459" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure so Emma jovanovich says</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.570" end="00:11:22.170" style="s2">dr. Peterson I want to thank you because</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.459" end="00:11:24.569" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a question for what you do</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.170" end="00:11:26.339" style="s2">I&#39;m a 22 year old girl and your videos</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.569" end="00:11:28.620" style="s2">are helping me so much with figuring my</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.339" end="00:11:30.390" style="s2">life out you are alone or helping me be</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.620" end="00:11:32.459" style="s2">braver every day well I&#39;m really happy</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.390" end="00:11:35.190" style="s2">about that you know what I like your</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.459" end="00:11:36.990" style="s2">emphasis on bravery you know because one</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.190" end="00:11:38.699" style="s2">of the things that we&#39;ve learned as</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.990" end="00:11:40.620" style="s2">clinicians say is that when you help</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.699" end="00:11:42.510" style="s2">people overcome anxiety it isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.620" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">you make them less anxious necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.510" end="00:11:46.500" style="s2">although I think you can do that to some</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:48.540" style="s2">degree by having people confront some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.500" end="00:11:50.279" style="s2">the demons in their past but instead of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.540" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">making them less anxious you make them</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.279" end="00:11:53.489" style="s2">braver and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.360" end="00:11:55.499" style="s2">the same thing right because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.489" end="00:11:57.869" style="s2">lots of reason to be anxious the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.499" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">full of uncertainty and fear and reasons</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.869" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">for fear and reasons for pain but to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">braver means to confront those</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:04.139" style="s2">voluntarily and that&#39;s really a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:06.779" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.139" end="00:12:08.730" style="s2">when will the next Bible lecture occur</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.779" end="00:12:10.439" style="s2">October 24th will be three of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.730" end="00:12:11.999" style="s2">before the end of December and I want to</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.439" end="00:12:20.220" style="s2">whole book although that would probably</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.220" end="00:12:26.189" style="s2">really think it&#39;s necessary because it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:28.139" style="s2">is the case that the specific narratives</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.189" end="00:12:30.029" style="s2">and the meta-narrative that are that are</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.130" end="00:13:44.850" style="s2">the Christ story that Jung wrote about a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.900" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">fair bit in a book called ion which is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.850" end="00:13:48.960" style="s2">very terrifying book and there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.620" end="00:13:51.990" style="s2">echoes of the myths of the Sun God and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.960" end="00:13:53.520" style="s2">but the funny thing is and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.990" end="00:13:55.640" style="s2">of the things I can&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.520" end="00:13:58.740" style="s2">about the biblical stories is that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.640" end="00:14:00.840" style="s2">manifest themselves at multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.740" end="00:14:02.370" style="s2">of interpretation simultaneously and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.840" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2">could say that that&#39;s merely a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.370" end="00:14:06.300" style="s2">consequence of continual historical</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.410" end="00:14:09.720" style="s2">reworking and I suppose that could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.300" end="00:14:12.150" style="s2">the case but the fact that they manifest</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.720" end="00:14:14.430" style="s2">themselves as a personal story and as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.150" end="00:14:17.070" style="s2">cosmic story and as a historical story</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.430" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">and as a mythological story and that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.070" end="00:14:21.300" style="s2">all works at the same time strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:23.580" style="s2">as pointing to something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.300" end="00:14:24.360" style="s2">somewhat beyond our current level of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.580" end="00:14:28.110" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.360" end="00:14:29.640" style="s2">I can&#39;t elaborate on that a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.110" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">it would take us into places that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.640" end="00:14:34.850" style="s2">really would rather not go but I do</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:37.500" style="s2">believe that like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.850" end="00:14:40.020" style="s2">synchronous using Jung&#39;s terminology</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.500" end="00:14:43.710" style="s2">about the about death and resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.020" end="00:14:45.960" style="s2">story and the synchronous element is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.710" end="00:14:48.210" style="s2">associated with the fact that the story</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.960" end="00:14:51.930" style="s2">echoes across so many levels of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.210" end="00:14:54.030" style="s2">and my sense is that when something</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.930" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">echoes across many levels of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.030" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">that means that it&#39;s approaching</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:15:00.660" style="s2">something like a very deep truth so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:02.850" style="s2">know that isn&#39;t normally how we go about</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.660" end="00:15:04.950" style="s2">determining what constitutes truth but</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.850" end="00:15:07.320" style="s2">we don&#39;t know everything about how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.950" end="00:15:10.290" style="s2">determine what constitutes truth yet and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.320" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">there are many things that we have yet</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.290" end="00:15:14.850" style="s2">to figure out and that&#39;s certainly one</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:17.250" style="s2">of them as far as I&#39;m concerned so there</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.850" end="00:15:19.620" style="s2">is a sun-god myth element certainly and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.250" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">parallels between Christ and Horus for</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.620" end="00:15:25.410" style="s2">example but that doesn&#39;t mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:27.959" style="s2">just say it&#39;s just a rewrite</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.410" end="00:15:29.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that the I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.959" end="00:15:32.930" style="s2">that that&#39;s historically or a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.670" end="00:15:35.639" style="s2">psychologically accurate</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.930" end="00:15:37.980" style="s2">have you watched Rick and Morty no I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.639" end="00:15:39.540" style="s2">haven&#39;t many people have told me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.980" end="00:15:41.579" style="s2">watch Rick and Morty although they said</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.540" end="00:15:44.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very dark and well that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.579" end="00:15:46.589" style="s2">bother me so much I suppose although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.040" end="00:15:49.560" style="s2">plenty dark perhaps without adding to it</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.589" end="00:15:52.379" style="s2">so but I would like to watch it and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.560" end="00:15:54.149" style="s2">probably will so I would love for you to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.379" end="00:15:55.620" style="s2">do come and do a talk in Montreal well</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.149" end="00:15:57.329" style="s2">you never know that might happen I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.620" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">been talking to God saw the both doubt a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.329" end="00:16:01.230" style="s2">fair bit you know he&#39;s coming to Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:02.819" style="s2">November 11th</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.230" end="00:16:06.209" style="s2">so we can do the talk that was shut down</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.819" end="00:16:10.259" style="s2">by Ryerson back in August so I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.209" end="00:16:12.420" style="s2">forward to that so what&#39;s the best way</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.259" end="00:16:14.730" style="s2">to stop drinking alcohol and start doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.420" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">my best in my psychology degree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.730" end="00:16:19.790" style="s2">affecting my study but I can do very</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:25.860" style="s2">well if I stop I&#39;m 26</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.790" end="00:16:27.540" style="s2">well Paul what I would say is I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.860" end="00:16:28.649" style="s2">you should do the future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.540" end="00:16:31.110" style="s2">program and you should really</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.649" end="00:16:34.740" style="s2">concentrate there&#39;s a section in it that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.110" end="00:16:36.449" style="s2">helps you determine what your positive</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.740" end="00:16:39.089" style="s2">view of your future would be but another</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.449" end="00:16:40.500" style="s2">section that helps you determine what</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.089" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">would happen in your life if your</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.500" end="00:16:44.430" style="s2">negative habits got out of control and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:46.860" style="s2">one of the things that can really help</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.430" end="00:16:49.769" style="s2">you control your alcohol intake is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.860" end="00:16:51.630" style="s2">really really think through what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.769" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">giving up and where you could be in five</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.630" end="00:16:57.060" style="s2">years if you don&#39;t get it under control</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">and proclivity to alcoholism can be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.060" end="00:17:01.410" style="s2">really vicious thing you know lots of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:04.650" style="s2">people get dragged down into the mud by</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.410" end="00:17:06.539" style="s2">alcohol excessive alcohol intake</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.650" end="00:17:08.520" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re sensitive to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.539" end="00:17:11.130" style="s2">opiate response that alcohol can produce</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.520" end="00:17:14.939" style="s2">you could tell that if you when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.130" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">drink you know you get alert and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.939" end="00:17:18.510" style="s2">say more enthusiastic and energetic and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:20.819" style="s2">then you don&#39;t want to stop drinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.510" end="00:17:22.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s definitely a bad sign</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.819" end="00:17:25.500" style="s2">with regards to developing alcoholism so</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.980" end="00:17:27.809" style="s2">I would say you need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.500" end="00:17:30.270" style="s2">something that&#39;s that&#39;s more important</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.809" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">to you than drinking and also think</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.270" end="00:17:33.960" style="s2">through very hard the negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:36.419" style="s2">consequences of continuing it you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.960" end="00:17:38.130" style="s2">about the age 26 where you should stop I</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.419" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">mean guys who are going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.130" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">generally starts slow down pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:47.220" style="s2">intensely around that age you know get</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:49.080" style="s2">also treating your psychology studying</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.220" end="00:17:51.870" style="s2">as a full-time job can also be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.080" end="00:17:53.490" style="s2">so you know get up at 8:00 morning or</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.870" end="00:17:55.799" style="s2">7:30 in the morning and start hitting</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.490" end="00:17:58.169" style="s2">the books by 9:00 and put in a 6 to 8</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.799" end="00:17:59.850" style="s2">hour date and then even if you do keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.169" end="00:18:05.309" style="s2">drinking at least you&#39;re moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.850" end="00:18:07.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I can say about are you a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.309" end="00:18:09.510" style="s2">science fiction fan you reference</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.470" end="00:18:11.220" style="s2">timeline Starship Troopers in a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.510" end="00:18:13.169" style="s2">and your ideas often remind me of</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.299" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">been I don&#39;t know five thousand books</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.669" end="00:18:45.390" style="s2">there 1970s 1960s and 1970s classics</p>

<p begin="00:18:45.390" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">would let me go over there and take like</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.460" end="00:18:50.940" style="s2">20 books at a time and I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:53.370" style="s2">about a book a day at that point and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.940" end="00:18:57.030" style="s2">read science fiction like mad probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.370" end="00:18:58.740" style="s2">till I was about 19 or so and maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.030" end="00:19:00.510" style="s2">little younger than that and then turned</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.740" end="00:19:03.419" style="s2">more to classic literature when I got to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.510" end="00:19:05.400" style="s2">college and and also partly as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.419" end="00:19:07.049" style="s2">consequence of some lessons that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.400" end="00:19:10.590" style="s2">local library had taught me about what</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.049" end="00:19:12.419" style="s2">to read so I was a science fiction fan</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.590" end="00:19:14.490" style="s2">I haven&#39;t read science fiction for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.419" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">very long time although I was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.490" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">happy with it when I was a kid so</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.010" end="00:19:36.690" style="s2">richard van Koppen says yes I have agra</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.580" end="00:19:40.680" style="s2">phobia and would love to hear about</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.690" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">anxiety well that&#39;s a that&#39;s a rough</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.680" end="00:19:46.680" style="s2">thing to have egg reform yeah so Agra</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:49.860" style="s2">phobics get increasingly isolated and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.680" end="00:19:52.560" style="s2">afraid of things outside of their domain</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.860" end="00:19:54.450" style="s2">of familiarity and often what happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.560" end="00:19:56.100" style="s2">with Agra phobia is that people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.450" end="00:19:58.350" style="s2">develop it or afraid of two things</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.100" end="00:19:59.970" style="s2">they&#39;re afraid that something is going</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.350" end="00:20:01.830" style="s2">to go dreadfully wrong with their health</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.970" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">especially with regards to their heart</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.830" end="00:20:04.710" style="s2">so they start to become afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:06.990" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll have a heart attack and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.710" end="00:20:08.970" style="s2">that they&#39;ll die in public far from a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.990" end="00:20:10.560" style="s2">hospital and that they&#39;ll make a fool of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.970" end="00:20:12.450" style="s2">themselves while they&#39;re doing it or</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.560" end="00:20:14.760" style="s2">well that well they think they&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:17.250" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a combination of two fears</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.760" end="00:20:19.290" style="s2">and one is fear of mortality and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.250" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">other is fear of social judgment and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.290" end="00:20:23.010" style="s2">might think about those as the two main</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:25.110" style="s2">categories of fear that possess people</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.010" end="00:20:27.060" style="s2">because one is associated well obviously</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.110" end="00:20:29.190" style="s2">with mortality and death and the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.060" end="00:20:31.140" style="s2">is associated with exclusion from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.190" end="00:20:32.940" style="s2">group which of course can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.140" end="00:20:34.680" style="s2">mortality and death and so the Agra</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.940" end="00:20:37.680" style="s2">phobics get the worst of both worlds</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.680" end="00:20:39.900" style="s2">it&#39;s often a disease of middle-aged</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.680" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">women but not always and they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.900" end="00:20:43.980" style="s2">people who&#39;ve been somewhat dependent in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:46.230" style="s2">their previous lives and then undergo</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.980" end="00:20:48.930" style="s2">some traumatic event like a divorce or</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.230" end="00:20:51.000" style="s2">the death of someone close and and at</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.930" end="00:20:52.470" style="s2">the same time are perhaps experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.000" end="00:20:55.830" style="s2">heart palpitations that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.470" end="00:20:58.980" style="s2">with menopause that brings ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.830" end="00:21:01.380" style="s2">mortality to mind and that can trigger a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.980" end="00:21:04.230" style="s2">panic attack which is very what would</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.380" end="00:21:05.730" style="s2">you call it unpleasant experience to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.230" end="00:21:08.640" style="s2">the least</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.730" end="00:21:10.500" style="s2">and then that fear of panic attacks</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.640" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">starts making people avoid and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.500" end="00:21:15.570" style="s2">when Agra phobia develops out of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:18.090" style="s2">disorders with panic attacks so you go</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.570" end="00:21:19.380" style="s2">out and maybe you go to a mall and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.090" end="00:21:21.750" style="s2">you&#39;re in a crowd and maybe you start</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.380" end="00:21:23.400" style="s2">thinking about well your heart beat and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.750" end="00:21:25.350" style="s2">about the fact that someone close to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.400" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">has died and maybe then you become aware</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.350" end="00:21:29.550" style="s2">of your heartbeat and you start to panic</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:32.580" style="s2">because you feel that maybe it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.550" end="00:21:34.440" style="s2">beat is irregular or or that or that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.580" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">can&#39;t detect it as well as you usually</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.440" end="00:21:38.220" style="s2">can and then that makes your heart</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:41.220" style="s2">accelerate because it makes you afraid</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.220" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">and then you get more more what would</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.220" end="00:21:44.930" style="s2">you call sensitive to that and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:47.000" style="s2">makes your heart rate beat even foul</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.930" end="00:21:48.620" style="s2">and then you panic you want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.000" end="00:21:50.990" style="s2">the hospital to get checked out to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.620" end="00:21:52.850" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re all right and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.990" end="00:21:54.970" style="s2">make your fatal mistake which is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.850" end="00:21:57.230" style="s2">you avoid going back to the mall and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.970" end="00:21:58.790" style="s2">then you go to the grocery store and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.230" end="00:22:00.710" style="s2">same thing happens and then you start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.790" end="00:22:03.380" style="s2">avoid going to the grocery store then</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.710" end="00:22:05.540" style="s2">you start to avoid avoiding the subway</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.380" end="00:22:07.220" style="s2">or taxis or crowds or anywhere you might</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.540" end="00:22:09.590" style="s2">get trapped and wouldn&#39;t be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.220" end="00:22:11.900" style="s2">to a hospital soon you end up avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.590" end="00:22:14.530" style="s2">everything and that&#39;s when your life</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.900" end="00:22:17.300" style="s2">really starts to become a living hell so</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.530" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">the basic way to treat a agoraphobia</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.300" end="00:22:21.770" style="s2">there&#39;s two ways and one is to develop</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:23.930" style="s2">some control over breathing to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.770" end="00:22:25.850" style="s2">progressive relaxation and the way you</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.930" end="00:22:27.980" style="s2">do that is that you start with your you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.850" end="00:22:30.290" style="s2">start by concentrating on your toes and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.980" end="00:22:32.330" style="s2">your feet and then your ankles and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.290" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">your shins and your knees you move all</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.330" end="00:22:37.610" style="s2">the way up your body and let the tension</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:40.250" style="s2">flow out of your muscles and regulate</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.610" end="00:22:42.740" style="s2">your breathing calmly and carefully so</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.250" end="00:22:47.090" style="s2">that you can learn to relax and then you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.740" end="00:22:48.620" style="s2">go out you go out voluntarily and start</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.090" end="00:22:50.450" style="s2">to confront the things you&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.620" end="00:22:52.460" style="s2">so for example if you&#39;re afraid of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.450" end="00:22:54.410" style="s2">mall maybe you go to the parking lot and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.460" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">you look at the mall and then you walk</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.410" end="00:22:58.100" style="s2">close to the door and you look inside</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:23:00.080" style="s2">you know and then you go home because</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.100" end="00:23:03.020" style="s2">that&#39;s enough for one day but you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:04.940" style="s2">progressive exposure and that&#39;s the base</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.020" end="00:23:06.230" style="s2">one of the basic rules of psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.940" end="00:23:08.660" style="s2">is that if you&#39;re afraid of something</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.230" end="00:23:11.300" style="s2">you progressively and voluntarily expose</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.660" end="00:23:13.340" style="s2">yourself to it and that generally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.300" end="00:23:15.470" style="s2">the voluntary exposure that&#39;s curative</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.340" end="00:23:17.510" style="s2">right accidental exposure can make you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.470" end="00:23:19.700" style="s2">worse but voluntary exposure can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.510" end="00:23:22.040" style="s2">curative and that&#39;s sort of associated</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.700" end="00:23:24.260" style="s2">with the myth of the hero and the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.040" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">you know the hero is the person who goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.260" end="00:23:29.000" style="s2">out voluntarily to confront the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:30.980" style="s2">and overcome it and get the treasure so</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.000" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">if you voluntarily expose yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.980" end="00:23:36.110" style="s2">things you&#39;re afraid of like no more</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:37.730" style="s2">than you can tolerate then you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.110" end="00:23:39.380" style="s2">that you get braver and you learn that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.730" end="00:23:41.630" style="s2">you can tolerate the fear and that can</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.380" end="00:23:44.210" style="s2">chase the Agra phobia back but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.630" end="00:23:46.010" style="s2">important to do it on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.210" end="00:23:47.630" style="s2">and if you have a agoraphobia a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.010" end="00:23:49.700" style="s2">full-fledged Agra phobia you should</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.630" end="00:23:51.410" style="s2">probably consult professional help</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.700" end="00:23:53.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s a very tricky condition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.410" end="00:23:58.330" style="s2">it can be very can really impair you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.510" end="00:24:01.220" style="s2">badly so that&#39;s what I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.330" end="00:24:03.409" style="s2">hi JP I&#39;m wondering how the computer</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.220" end="00:24:05.629" style="s2">program that rates university courses as</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.409" end="00:24:08.210" style="s2">worthwhile or not is coming along well</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.629" end="00:24:10.489" style="s2">it isn&#39;t rating them as worthwhile it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.210" end="00:24:12.619" style="s2">rating them as postmodern neo-marxist or</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.489" end="00:24:14.899" style="s2">not and it&#39;s actually fully developed I</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.619" end="00:24:17.690" style="s2">was going to launch it and I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.899" end="00:24:19.879" style="s2">didn&#39;t design it somebody volunteered to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.690" end="00:24:22.610" style="s2">design it and presented it to me and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.879" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">seems to work very well I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.610" end="00:24:26.330" style="s2">launch it at the end of August so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:28.100" style="s2">this year&#39;s University students can</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.330" end="00:24:30.529" style="s2">benefit from it but there was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.100" end="00:24:32.690" style="s2">Charlottesville event and then I got</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.529" end="00:24:34.940" style="s2">busy and I also wasn&#39;t feeling great and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.690" end="00:24:38.179" style="s2">so I just didn&#39;t hit the window of time</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.940" end="00:24:41.419" style="s2">properly but I hope to be able to launch</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.179" end="00:24:43.070" style="s2">it for the January incoming class to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.419" end="00:24:45.049" style="s2">a video about what&#39;s wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.070" end="00:24:46.580" style="s2">university system the many things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.049" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">are wrong with the university system and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.580" end="00:24:50.690" style="s2">to launch the website at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:52.220" style="s2">also had people suggest to me that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.690" end="00:24:54.980" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a good idea that it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.220" end="00:24:56.779" style="s2">increase polarization but I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.980" end="00:24:58.730" style="s2">about that for about a month and a half</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.779" end="00:25:00.590" style="s2">and I think that the benefit to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.730" end="00:25:02.539" style="s2">consumer so that would be the informed</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.590" end="00:25:03.710" style="s2">student outweighs any danger of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.539" end="00:25:05.389" style="s2">polarization</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.710" end="00:25:06.739" style="s2">besides that something has to be done</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.389" end="00:25:10.600" style="s2">because the situation in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.739" end="00:25:12.830" style="s2">universities is really ridiculous so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.600" end="00:25:22.369" style="s2">alright so let&#39;s see what else we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.830" end="00:25:24.379" style="s2">here in the chat room DVS sk8er 3 that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.369" end="00:25:25.940" style="s2">quite a mouthful says I&#39;m studying to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.379" end="00:25:27.710" style="s2">a teacher but I&#39;m also an introvert</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.940" end="00:25:29.359" style="s2">could this be a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.710" end="00:25:32.389" style="s2">can I still be a successful teacher</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.359" end="00:25:35.419" style="s2">actually what seems to predict success</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.389" end="00:25:37.940" style="s2">of teaching best is intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.419" end="00:25:40.820" style="s2">conscientiousness that&#39;s the data so far</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.940" end="00:25:41.659" style="s2">so if you&#39;re conscientious then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.820" end="00:25:44.299" style="s2">probably be fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.659" end="00:25:46.429" style="s2">I mean extra introverts have a harder</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.299" end="00:25:47.869" style="s2">time speaking in front of groups but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.429" end="00:25:49.759" style="s2">can learn to do that you know an</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.869" end="00:25:52.399" style="s2">introvert can become a very successful</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.759" end="00:25:54.289" style="s2">public speaker may not enjoy it the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.399" end="00:25:55.730" style="s2">way that an extrovert might but that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.289" end="00:25:58.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t learn those</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.730" end="00:25:59.899" style="s2">skills and what I would recommend for an</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.549" end="00:26:01.879" style="s2">introvert is the same thing that I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.899" end="00:26:02.870" style="s2">when I&#39;m lecturing is I never talk to</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.879" end="00:26:04.760" style="s2">the whole group</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.870" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how big the crowd is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.760" end="00:26:09.020" style="s2">always picking out individuals in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:10.730" style="s2">group and talking specifically to them</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.020" end="00:26:12.680" style="s2">so I&#39;ll make a point to an individual</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.730" end="00:26:14.450" style="s2">and I watch their face and see if</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.680" end="00:26:16.280" style="s2">they&#39;re nodding and understanding right</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.450" end="00:26:18.200" style="s2">because that way you make contact with</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.280" end="00:26:20.090" style="s2">the entire audience and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.200" end="00:26:21.620" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk to someone for about 15</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.090" end="00:26:23.630" style="s2">seconds or so I don&#39;t want to put them</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.620" end="00:26:25.820" style="s2">on the spot too much and then I shift my</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.630" end="00:26:28.130" style="s2">attention to someone else and I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.820" end="00:26:29.930" style="s2">pinpoint around the room that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.130" end="00:26:32.420" style="s2">everybody in the room focused on what</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.930" end="00:26:34.370" style="s2">I&#39;m saying because each person reflects</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.420" end="00:26:35.870" style="s2">the entire crowd back to you and so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.370" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">would say if you&#39;re an introvert or if</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.870" end="00:26:40.340" style="s2">you want to speak in public in general</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:43.309" style="s2">forget about the damn crowd it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.340" end="00:26:45.020" style="s2">exist speak to people one at one at a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.309" end="00:26:48.500" style="s2">time and an introvert can do that just</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.020" end="00:26:50.540" style="s2">fine so you know that&#39;s where your</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.500" end="00:26:54.020" style="s2">strength would be and I would say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.540" end="00:26:56.030" style="s2">much more likely to be unsuccessful as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.020" end="00:26:57.650" style="s2">teacher if you don&#39;t work hard at it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.030" end="00:26:58.910" style="s2">if you&#39;re not interested in and so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.650" end="00:27:01.400" style="s2">you&#39;re an introvert I wouldn&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.910" end="00:27:06.460" style="s2">about that I don&#39;t think that that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.400" end="00:27:06.460" style="s2">the biggest problem that you&#39;ll face so</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.420" end="00:27:21.730" style="s2">cut Knicks are overrated says ditch your</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.390" end="00:27:23.470" style="s2">barber well I actually like my barber</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.730" end="00:27:24.970" style="s2">quite a bit but his haircuts a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.470" end="00:27:29.770" style="s2">shorter than I&#39;m accustomed to and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.970" end="00:27:30.490" style="s2">there&#39;s some reasons for that but what</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.770" end="00:27:33.010" style="s2">can I say</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.490" end="00:27:35.290" style="s2">how hair grows back and I&#39;ll be just as</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.290" end="00:27:39.640" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s how that is see now</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.690" end="00:27:42.910" style="s2">Richard van Copeland says my haircuts</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.640" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">looking fresh so who&#39;s that Knicks are</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.600" end="00:29:16.540" style="s2">promise and we had a good discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.740" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">let&#39;s see is that it I think that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.540" end="00:29:22.030" style="s2">and you probably know or maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:24.610" style="s2">I just finished a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.030" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">Camille Paglia and we went down there I</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.610" end="00:29:28.690" style="s2">took a film crew down there to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.480" style="s2">Philadelphia and met her at her</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.690" end="00:29:32.650" style="s2">University and we talked for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.480" end="00:29:35.179" style="s2">hours and that was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.650" end="00:29:38.419" style="s2">she&#39;s quite the fireball that woman</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.179" end="00:29:40.789" style="s2">and unbelievably verbally fluent and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.419" end="00:29:44.269" style="s2">sharp and so I finally met someone who</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.789" end="00:29:46.519" style="s2">could talk more than me and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.269" end="00:29:48.259" style="s2">probably good so but I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.519" end="00:29:49.609" style="s2">speaking with her and I think about a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.259" end="00:29:51.499" style="s2">hundred thousand people have watched</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.609" end="00:29:54.229" style="s2">that now in a day so that&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.499" end="00:29:56.419" style="s2">so we talked about post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.229" end="00:29:58.609" style="s2">malaise that confronts the modern</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.419" end="00:30:01.429" style="s2">University and all of those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.609" end="00:30:03.589" style="s2">things so Robin Dionne says do you ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.429" end="00:30:05.690" style="s2">miss Montreal hey I was just in Montreal</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.589" end="00:30:07.820" style="s2">I went there to saw saw a band called</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.690" end="00:30:09.139" style="s2">Half Moon Run which I bound I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.820" end="00:30:10.820" style="s2">highly recommend they were playing with</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.139" end="00:30:13.159" style="s2">the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.820" end="00:30:16.849" style="s2">got invited to meet one of the singers</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.159" end="00:30:18.289" style="s2">and also go in now and see the concert</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.849" end="00:30:20.149" style="s2">which was excellent and yeah I&#39;d miss</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.289" end="00:30:22.099" style="s2">Montreal Montreal is a great city for</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.149" end="00:30:24.139" style="s2">you Americans who are listening should</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.099" end="00:30:26.299" style="s2">go visit Montreal man it&#39;s a cool place</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.139" end="00:30:30.489" style="s2">spend a week there in the summer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.299" end="00:30:33.879" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good city in every way so</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.489" end="00:30:33.879" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.480" end="00:30:41.799" style="s2">it seems we are bound to repeat history</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.910" end="00:30:43.240" style="s2">and what as old becomes new again why is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.799" end="00:30:46.390" style="s2">it that we can&#39;t seem to find</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.240" end="00:30:48.100" style="s2">equilibrium within a society ideas begin</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.390" end="00:30:50.740" style="s2">with good intentions but lead towards</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.100" end="00:30:53.080" style="s2">the extreme yeah well the reason we</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.740" end="00:30:54.790" style="s2">can&#39;t find equilibrium is because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.080" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">environment that we live in isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.790" end="00:30:59.860" style="s2">equilibrium and so I I kind of imagine</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:02.200" style="s2">it this way it&#39;s like we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.860" end="00:31:03.970" style="s2">traversing the back of a giant this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.200" end="00:31:07.000" style="s2">obviously a symbolic reference of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.970" end="00:31:08.919" style="s2">giant serpent and it&#39;s it weaves back</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.000" end="00:31:10.750" style="s2">and forth and you don&#39;t know at any</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.919" end="00:31:13.059" style="s2">moment which way it&#39;s gonna curve and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.750" end="00:31:14.830" style="s2">turn and so sometimes it turns to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.059" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">right and sometimes it turns to the left</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.830" end="00:31:18.040" style="s2">and what that means politically is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:19.690" style="s2">sometimes we have to turn to the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.040" end="00:31:22.600" style="s2">and sometimes we have to turn to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.690" end="00:31:26.140" style="s2">left and we don&#39;t know exactly when</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.600" end="00:31:28.660" style="s2">those what would you call we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.140" end="00:31:30.580" style="s2">exactly how to time that and so what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.660" end="00:31:32.110" style="s2">all have to do is keep our eyes open and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.580" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">tell the truth and discuss things with</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.110" end="00:31:35.140" style="s2">each other especially with people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.240" style="s2">have political beliefs that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.140" end="00:31:39.460" style="s2">different than us so that we can ensure</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.240" end="00:31:42.220" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t tilted too far one way</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.460" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">or the other and that&#39;s why I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.220" end="00:31:45.549" style="s2">advocate of free speech or one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.950" style="s2">many reasons I&#39;m an advocate of free</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.549" end="00:31:49.500" style="s2">speech is because it&#39;s the continual</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.950" end="00:31:51.910" style="s2">dialogue between people of different</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.500" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">temperamental types that keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.910" end="00:31:56.200" style="s2">oriented as close as we can to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">center of the Serpent&#39;s back and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.200" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">there is no permanent equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:01.750" style="s2">there&#39;s only the equilibrium that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:04.720" style="s2">produced by continual negotiation and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.750" end="00:32:08.830" style="s2">democracy is a formalized negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:12.250" style="s2">and so and and and it&#39;s free speech that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.830" end="00:32:14.470" style="s2">keeps it healthy and alive so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.250" end="00:32:17.130" style="s2">permanent equivalent equilibrium state</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.470" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">except death no and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.130" end="00:32:21.309" style="s2">negotiation in relationships to like if</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:23.140" style="s2">you have an intimate relationship or a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.309" end="00:32:25.090" style="s2">familial relationship or even a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.140" end="00:32:26.919" style="s2">friendship there&#39;s no final equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.090" end="00:32:29.620" style="s2">state you have to communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.919" end="00:32:31.900" style="s2">other honestly all the time and keep the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.620" end="00:32:33.460" style="s2">relationship moving to adjust the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.900" end="00:32:35.740" style="s2">environment that the relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.460" end="00:32:37.900" style="s2">operating in that&#39;s how it stays alive</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.740" end="00:32:39.520" style="s2">in an intimate long-term intimate</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.900" end="00:32:42.910" style="s2">relationship like a marriage it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.520" end="00:32:44.980" style="s2">continual it takes continual effort I</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.910" end="00:32:46.570" style="s2">mean it&#39;s worthwhile effort and and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.980" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">but you have to be conscious and awake</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.570" end="00:32:50.130" style="s2">to keep your relationship alive</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.500" style="s2">and you have to be communicating all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.130" end="00:32:57.780" style="s2">time well maybe not all the time because</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.500" end="00:33:01.050" style="s2">you can over communicate too but so well</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.780" end="00:33:07.410" style="s2">so that&#39;s why we can&#39;t reach a state of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.050" end="00:33:10.970" style="s2">permanent equilibrium okay let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.410" end="00:33:13.740" style="s2">to the previously submitted questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.970" end="00:33:16.110" style="s2">how can I overcome my fear of driving on</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.740" end="00:33:20.040" style="s2">freeways well one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.110" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">could do this is Ellis is do a fair bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.040" end="00:33:24.150" style="s2">of imagining driving on freeways and try</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.010" style="s2">to make the imagining as realistic as</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.150" end="00:33:29.100" style="s2">possible but then the other thing you</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.010" end="00:33:31.380" style="s2">can do is again it&#39;s graduated exposure</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.100" end="00:33:32.970" style="s2">if you&#39;re afraid of driving go drive</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.380" end="00:33:34.650" style="s2">with someone you trust in a parking lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.970" end="00:33:36.990" style="s2">on Sunday morning when there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.650" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">there and then drive around the block</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.990" end="00:33:41.070" style="s2">and a street that isn&#39;t busy and then go</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:43.380" style="s2">to the slightly busier Street and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.070" end="00:33:45.270" style="s2">go to a slightly busier Street and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.380" end="00:33:48.180" style="s2">find a highway that&#39;s like I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.270" end="00:33:49.950" style="s2">two-lane er so that you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.180" end="00:33:53.040" style="s2">practice merging and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.950" end="00:33:55.530" style="s2">you got to build a plan say with 20</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.040" end="00:33:57.900" style="s2">degrees of difficulty with the highest</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.530" end="00:34:00.300" style="s2">degree of difficulty maybe being merging</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.900" end="00:34:02.310" style="s2">onto a busy four-lane highway and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.300" end="00:34:04.110" style="s2">could go at night and practice merging</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.310" end="00:34:06.510" style="s2">onto the busy highway because it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.110" end="00:34:08.430" style="s2">be busy at night so I would say what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.510" end="00:34:10.740" style="s2">do is you break it down into small steps</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.430" end="00:34:12.930" style="s2">and then practice each step until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.740" end="00:34:14.100" style="s2">bored with the step and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.930" end="00:34:16.500" style="s2">bored with it that means you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.100" end="00:34:18.870" style="s2">longer anxious about it and don&#39;t quit</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.500" end="00:34:20.550" style="s2">you know like stick at it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.870" end="00:34:22.710" style="s2">really useful to overcome a fear and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.550" end="00:34:23.940" style="s2">once you&#39;ve identified a fear then</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.710" end="00:34:26.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve identified something to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.940" end="00:34:28.470" style="s2">that can definitely make you stronger so</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.280" end="00:34:30.600" style="s2">like good luck with it and get</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.470" end="00:34:33.180" style="s2">professional like take a driving course</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.600" end="00:34:34.950" style="s2">if you need to as well and find someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.180" end="00:34:36.750" style="s2">to work with it isn&#39;t gonna make you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.950" end="00:34:39.030" style="s2">nervous and isn&#39;t gonna harass you but</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.750" end="00:34:42.110" style="s2">don&#39;t quit it&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.030" end="00:34:42.110" style="s2">overcome a fear like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.440" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">no I just picked something I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.000" end="00:34:51.350" style="s2">have clicked actually I&#39;m pretty happy</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:53.899" style="s2">with myself my son isn&#39;t here as I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.350" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">mentioned I&#39;m still not like destroying</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.899" end="00:35:00.100" style="s2">this completely although I may have done</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:00.100" style="s2">it now No</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.260" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">see that&#39;s what happens when you brag</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.300" end="00:35:27.390" style="s2">because now all I&#39;ve got is one question</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:30.590" style="s2">from pigeonhole and not all of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:30.590" style="s2">let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.810" end="00:35:42.620" style="s2">got it pack back to chart was the trick</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.600" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">so hey I&#39;m actually managing this up too</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.620" end="00:35:50.180" style="s2">badly so let&#39;s see here some more</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:52.630" style="s2">questions from that from the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.180" end="00:35:52.630" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.360" end="00:36:01.780" style="s2">dr. Peterson I&#39;m really hoping you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.610" end="00:36:07.690" style="s2">share your thoughts on the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.780" end="00:36:10.270" style="s2">shooting yeah well what I would do is</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.690" end="00:36:12.070" style="s2">recommend the biblical lecture I did on</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.270" end="00:36:16.180" style="s2">Cain and Abel I would say because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.070" end="00:36:18.460" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a good summary of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.180" end="00:36:20.290" style="s2">state of mind that somebody has to be in</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.460" end="00:36:23.290" style="s2">in order to do what was done at Las</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.290" end="00:36:26.260" style="s2">Vegas so you have to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.290" end="00:36:27.910" style="s2">embittered by life in order to do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.260" end="00:36:30.490" style="s2">sort of thing and you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.910" end="00:36:32.530" style="s2">searching for revenge I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.490" end="00:36:34.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know you might think well</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.530" end="00:36:36.310" style="s2">it&#39;s only revenge on other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.570" end="00:36:38.380" style="s2">because you&#39;ve developed hatred for</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.310" end="00:36:40.900" style="s2">people but it&#39;s deeper than that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.380" end="00:36:43.990" style="s2">not just hatred for people I would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.900" end="00:36:46.030" style="s2">it&#39;s hatred for being itself and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.990" end="00:36:48.460" style="s2">desire to take revenge on being for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.030" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">outrage of the tragedy and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.460" end="00:36:53.380" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with being and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:55.840" style="s2">the tragedy and suffering that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.380" end="00:36:57.850" style="s2">part parcel of your own life and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.840" end="00:36:59.950" style="s2">makes you embittered and then past</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.850" end="00:37:02.500" style="s2">embittered becomes outraged and past</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.950" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">outrage becomes well homicidal or even</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.500" end="00:37:09.030" style="s2">genocidal and that&#39;s a terrible state of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">mind to be in it&#39;s a hellish state I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.030" end="00:37:13.380" style="s2">believe that the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.960" end="00:37:15.580" style="s2">conceptualize the state of mind that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.380" end="00:37:17.230" style="s2">someone has to be in in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.580" end="00:37:19.000" style="s2">something like the Columbine shootings</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.230" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">for example or what happened in Las</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.000" end="00:37:22.360" style="s2">Vegas is that you&#39;re really and now you</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:24.070" style="s2">have to speak about it religious</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.360" end="00:37:26.350" style="s2">languages you&#39;re really out for revenge</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.070" end="00:37:28.660" style="s2">against God for the outrage of creation</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.350" end="00:37:30.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like to me and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.660" end="00:37:32.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a state of mind that&#39;s truly</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.820" end="00:37:34.330" style="s2">hellish and you can get there by</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.620" end="00:37:36.490" style="s2">brooding long enough now it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.330" end="00:37:38.680" style="s2">possible I mean this guy didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.490" end="00:37:40.510" style="s2">previous history criminal history or</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.680" end="00:37:43.090" style="s2">anything like that he&#39;s pretty old so</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.510" end="00:37:44.940" style="s2">you know there&#39;s also all also the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.090" end="00:37:47.160" style="s2">possibility of some kind of neurological</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.940" end="00:37:49.180" style="s2">pathology that that might be</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.160" end="00:37:51.310" style="s2">characteristic of him you know some</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.180" end="00:37:53.950" style="s2">degenerative neurological disease there</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.310" end="00:37:55.990" style="s2">was a kid years ago at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.950" end="00:37:58.330" style="s2">Texas and Austin who climbed up on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.990" end="00:37:59.860" style="s2">tower there and shot a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.330" end="00:38:01.870" style="s2">with a high-powered rifle and he had a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.860" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.870" end="00:38:07.600" style="s2">and had reported like these being</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:10.779" style="s2">overcome with extreme feelings of rage</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.600" end="00:38:15.189" style="s2">and so that&#39;s another possibility but</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.779" end="00:38:18.130" style="s2">I would say the embitterment hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.189" end="00:38:20.919" style="s2">is the strongest one I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.130" end="00:38:23.019" style="s2">too I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.919" end="00:38:24.669" style="s2">this today is that one of the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.019" end="00:38:27.429" style="s2">controlling this sort of thing would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.669" end="00:38:29.769" style="s2">for the press to agree not for there to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.429" end="00:38:32.890" style="s2">be a blanket agreement not to publicize</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.769" end="00:38:34.269" style="s2">the name or any other identity markers</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.890" end="00:38:37.929" style="s2">of the people who do the shooting</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.269" end="00:38:40.509" style="s2">because there&#39;s also this really what</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.929" end="00:38:42.819" style="s2">would you call it arrogance it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.509" end="00:38:45.039" style="s2">of arrogance and pride last-ditch</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.819" end="00:38:47.709" style="s2">arrogance and pride that that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.039" end="00:38:49.869" style="s2">associated with the fantasies that drive</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.709" end="00:38:52.689" style="s2">this sort of behavior and the fantasy is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.869" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">something like well after I do this</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.689" end="00:38:56.650" style="s2">everyone will sure know though who the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:58.779" style="s2">hell I was you know even though maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.650" end="00:39:00.489" style="s2">was ignored or unhappy when I was alive</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.779" end="00:39:02.919" style="s2">after I&#39;m dead everybody&#39;s gonna know</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.489" end="00:39:05.499" style="s2">who I was and what I did then you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.919" end="00:39:08.769" style="s2">so there&#39;s this underground desire for</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.499" end="00:39:10.959" style="s2">fame I guess its notoriety but notoriety</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.769" end="00:39:13.390" style="s2">might be preferable to being ignored and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.959" end="00:39:15.249" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s a lot of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.390" end="00:39:16.959" style="s2">gun control and that&#39;s understandable</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.249" end="00:39:21.640" style="s2">especially with regards to automatic</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.959" end="00:39:23.259" style="s2">rifles hmm although I also understand</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.259" end="00:39:29.019" style="s2">afraid of allowing what they regard is</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.579" end="00:39:32.469" style="s2">one of their fundamental rights to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.019" end="00:39:35.019" style="s2">infringed upon but it would certainly be</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.469" end="00:39:36.909" style="s2">useful if we stopped giving people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.019" end="00:39:38.619" style="s2">do this sort of thing hundred million</p>

<p begin="00:39:42.309" end="00:39:46.319" style="s2">about controlling it so</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.170" end="00:40:00.450" style="s2">have a glass of wine relax yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:03.360" style="s2">was just up and I have this little cabin</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.450" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">up north of Toronto about three hours</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.360" end="00:40:07.740" style="s2">north that my wife bought with some</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:11.010" style="s2">money that her dad left her gave her</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.740" end="00:40:13.410" style="s2">actually he&#39;s still alive and I was up</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.010" end="00:40:15.869" style="s2">there this weekend and it was relaxing I</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.410" end="00:40:19.650" style="s2">was working a bit on this new</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.869" end="00:40:21.900" style="s2">personality scale and on the palea video</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.650" end="00:40:24.210" style="s2">but I I did relax a bit and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.900" end="00:40:28.200" style="s2">feeling a lot better than I was for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.210" end="00:40:30.540" style="s2">last Q&amp;A so the mornings are still rough</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.200" end="00:40:32.580" style="s2">but by this time of night I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.540" end="00:40:37.190" style="s2">vaguely human so thank God for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.580" end="00:40:40.050" style="s2">because it was pretty brutal so anyhow</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.750" end="00:40:55.050" style="s2">that&#39;s too that&#39;s too dramatic I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.400" end="00:40:57.330" style="s2">guess that what you&#39;re pointing out is</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.330" end="00:41:00.869" style="s2">appreciate that I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.869" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">might seem to be rather hypocritical as</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.850" end="00:41:10.710" style="s2">it isn&#39;t like I&#39;ve shied away from</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:12.300" style="s2">exposing my views in public but I felt</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.710" end="00:41:15.109" style="s2">that I was driven to that by necessity</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.300" end="00:41:17.730" style="s2">and also by my desire to educate people</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.109" end="00:41:19.590" style="s2">however I would say despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.730" end="00:41:21.630" style="s2">that I&#39;m somewhat uncomfortable with it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.590" end="00:41:23.580" style="s2">I think that&#39;s mostly because of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.630" end="00:41:25.560" style="s2">responsibility you know and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.580" end="00:41:27.780" style="s2">terrified for a whole year that I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.560" end="00:41:31.740" style="s2">something you know unforgivably stupid</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.780" end="00:41:33.450" style="s2">and you know demolish myself in public</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.740" end="00:41:34.920" style="s2">and and you know feel guilty and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.450" end="00:41:37.290" style="s2">horrible about that for the rest of my</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.920" end="00:41:38.850" style="s2">life and so far I&#39;d be fortunate there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.290" end="00:41:41.850" style="s2">been some close calls but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.850" end="00:41:44.250" style="s2">fortunate but you know now when I go</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.850" end="00:41:45.690" style="s2">places people often recognize me even at</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.250" end="00:41:46.750" style="s2">this little town we went up to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.690" end="00:41:48.190" style="s2">weekend there were two</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.750" end="00:41:49.780" style="s2">well that came up to me in parking lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.190" end="00:41:52.630" style="s2">and we&#39;re excited to beat me and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.780" end="00:41:54.340" style="s2">know the vast majority of encounters all</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.630" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">of the encounters I have with people in</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.340" end="00:41:58.660" style="s2">public have been really wonderful I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:00.670" style="s2">to say that they people have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.660" end="00:42:02.470" style="s2">extremely friendly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.670" end="00:42:05.170" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re a bit starstruck which</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.470" end="00:42:07.750" style="s2">I find strange I can see the projection</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.170" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s it&#39;s unsettling for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.750" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">although I&#39;m not judging anybody for it</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:19.300" style="s2">it&#39;s just a strange thing to observe but</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:23.620" style="s2">you know I can&#39;t complain about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.300" end="00:42:25.630" style="s2">that people are are are are positively</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.620" end="00:42:27.250" style="s2">predisposed to what I&#39;m doing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.630" end="00:42:29.080" style="s2">it&#39;s such a privilege I can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.250" end="00:42:31.360" style="s2">what it would be like to be hated</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.080" end="00:42:36.040" style="s2">publicly I think that would just kill me</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.360" end="00:42:37.900" style="s2">I really think that but um so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.040" end="00:42:39.610" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s I suppose there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.900" end="00:42:42.220" style="s2">possibility of having that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.610" end="00:42:44.770" style="s2">go to your head and it&#39;s it and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.220" end="00:42:46.630" style="s2">that happens to people but I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.770" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">said this before maybe on the Q&amp;A so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.630" end="00:42:54.490" style="s2">have a pretty sensible family and I have</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:57.010" style="s2">a pretty what would you say I have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.490" end="00:42:59.530" style="s2">pretty good sense of my limitations I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.010" end="00:43:03.720" style="s2">would say let&#39;s we could even call it an</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.530" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">acute sense and so I&#39;m not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.720" end="00:43:10.180" style="s2">worried that this is going to go to my</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:12.940" style="s2">head in some way that that would you</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.180" end="00:43:15.400" style="s2">know inflate my ego or something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.940" end="00:43:17.260" style="s2">that huh I mean I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.400" end="00:43:18.910" style="s2">things I have noticed is that I might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.260" end="00:43:23.320" style="s2">a little less patient with people when</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.910" end="00:43:25.690" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking because I&#39;m more used to</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.320" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">that more use to that might be good for</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.690" end="00:43:29.380" style="s2">me to be listened to and so I have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:31.180" style="s2">watch that but I&#39;m pretty I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.380" end="00:43:32.890" style="s2">been pretty noisy and talkative and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.180" end="00:43:35.110" style="s2">that&#39;s probably something that&#39;s plagued</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.890" end="00:43:37.870" style="s2">me or being a characteristic of me ever</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.110" end="00:43:40.090" style="s2">since I was a little tiny kid I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.870" end="00:43:43.330" style="s2">used to talk all the time when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.090" end="00:43:46.060" style="s2">little little little guy I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.330" end="00:43:47.890" style="s2">my cousin Eric ponen he probably listens</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.060" end="00:43:49.780" style="s2">to this he used to call me motormouth</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.890" end="00:43:53.060" style="s2">and that was about exactly right I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.780" end="00:43:55.619" style="s2">like a miniature Camille Paglia so</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.060" end="00:43:57.780" style="s2">anyways I can&#39;t complain about having</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.619" end="00:44:00.060" style="s2">let&#39;s say fansite people have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.780" end="00:44:03.530" style="s2">unbelievably good to me and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.060" end="00:44:03.530" style="s2">grateful for that so</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.450" end="00:44:14.460" style="s2">what is the best way to find a routine</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.579" end="00:44:18.570" style="s2">when you&#39;re diagnosed bipolar well I</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.460" end="00:44:22.530" style="s2">would say a couple of things the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.570" end="00:44:25.530" style="s2">is try to set your sleep-wake cycle</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.530" end="00:44:27.510" style="s2">stabili so pick a time in the morning to</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.530" end="00:44:29.160" style="s2">get up that&#39;s the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.510" end="00:44:30.900" style="s2">just get up at the same time every</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.160" end="00:44:32.280" style="s2">morning and that might be difficult both</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.900" end="00:44:34.710" style="s2">when you&#39;re manic and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.280" end="00:44:36.359" style="s2">depressed but the closer you can stick</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.710" end="00:44:38.359" style="s2">to that the better and I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.359" end="00:44:40.710" style="s2">try to stabilize when you go to bed and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.359" end="00:44:42.450" style="s2">maybe a little later rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.710" end="00:44:44.119" style="s2">little earlier because you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.450" end="00:44:49.310" style="s2">be laying there flipping around like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.119" end="00:44:49.310" style="s2">like a fish trying to go to sleep you</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.400" end="00:44:54.630" style="s2">want to stabilize your sleep weight</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.750" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">routines because bipolar disorder is in</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.630" end="00:44:59.130" style="s2">part a circadian rhythm disorder and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:01.290" style="s2">anything that destabilizes your</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.130" end="00:45:03.270" style="s2">circadian rhythms is going to increase</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.290" end="00:45:05.849" style="s2">the probability that you&#39;ll have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.270" end="00:45:07.800" style="s2">episode and that includes flying I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.849" end="00:45:10.320" style="s2">believe that at Gatwick Airport there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.800" end="00:45:11.970" style="s2">a name in England there&#39;s a special team</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.320" end="00:45:13.650" style="s2">that deals with people whose mania has</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.970" end="00:45:16.170" style="s2">been triggered by the overnight flight</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.650" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">so and then the other thing I would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.170" end="00:45:21.210" style="s2">is stabilise the times you eat because</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:22.920" style="s2">these basic biological rhythms eating</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.210" end="00:45:24.599" style="s2">and sleeping in particular are part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.920" end="00:45:26.520" style="s2">what stabilize your nervous system and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.599" end="00:45:29.849" style="s2">if you have bipolar disorder then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.520" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">likely to be very susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.849" end="00:45:35.400" style="s2">destabilize destabilize routine</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:37.069" style="s2">routinized activities routinize your</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.400" end="00:45:39.630" style="s2">life to the degree that that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.069" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">and I would say the other thing you</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.630" end="00:45:43.500" style="s2">could do is use a calendar you know and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:46.950" style="s2">like a Google Calendar or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.500" end="00:45:48.180" style="s2">whatever calendar and I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.950" end="00:45:50.099" style="s2">a good thing for everyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.180" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">listening to think about so want to plan</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.099" end="00:45:55.650" style="s2">out your days and your weeks and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:57.869" style="s2">don&#39;t plan a prison right you use the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.650" end="00:45:59.609" style="s2">calendar to design the days that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.869" end="00:46:01.500" style="s2">would like to have and so part of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.609" end="00:46:02.849" style="s2">going to be responsibility obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.500" end="00:46:04.980" style="s2">because you have to keep up with your</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.849" end="00:46:07.890" style="s2">responsibilities or they overwhelm you</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.450" end="00:49:41.070" style="s2">through understanding but that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.190" end="00:49:43.350" style="s2">generally less willing to do the work</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.350" end="00:49:48.750" style="s2">then is in fact necessary it takes an</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.440" end="00:49:51.630" style="s2">awful lot of study like it took me years</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.750" end="00:49:53.400" style="s2">of reading you to really start to</p>

<p begin="00:49:59.460" end="00:50:04.470" style="s2">well that&#39;s true often of the things</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.470" end="00:50:08.250" style="s2">mean I think there is a place for</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.330" end="00:50:18.690" style="s2">pseudo Gnosticism fundamentally and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.240" end="00:50:21.390" style="s2">people putting forward ill-considered</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.869" end="00:51:02.019" style="s2">could be a rough combination the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.339" end="00:51:03.309" style="s2">conscientiousness should actually help</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.309" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">bit perfectionistic the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.459" end="00:51:09.969" style="s2">being high and openness which is</p>

<p begin="00:51:30.219" end="00:51:35.950" style="s2">and you&#39;re always thinking up new things</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.749" end="00:51:38.349" style="s2">you tend to saw off the branch that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.950" end="00:51:41.259" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting on on a regular basis and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.349" end="00:51:43.809" style="s2">that can be pretty destabilizing any</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.259" end="00:51:46.420" style="s2">tips on dealing with that well I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.809" end="00:51:48.579" style="s2">repeat what I said earlier I think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.420" end="00:51:52.059" style="s2">one of the things that you do if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.579" end="00:51:54.910" style="s2">high in anxiety is to stabilize your</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.059" end="00:51:56.769" style="s2">sleep-wake cycles so get up at the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.910" end="00:51:58.660" style="s2">time go to bed at the same time and eat</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.769" end="00:52:00.819" style="s2">at the same time make sure that you eat</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.660" end="00:52:04.089" style="s2">breakfast and a big breakfast too that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.819" end="00:52:06.849" style="s2">heavy on fat and protein because if</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.089" end="00:52:08.380" style="s2">you&#39;re hungry and then you stress</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.849" end="00:52:11.380" style="s2">yourself especially if you&#39;re high in</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.380" end="00:52:13.180" style="s2">neuroticism you destabilize your your</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.380" end="00:52:14.829" style="s2">insulin production system and it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.180" end="00:52:18.299" style="s2">be stabilized till you go to sleep again</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.829" end="00:52:21.190" style="s2">so I would say like two things one is</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.299" end="00:52:23.229" style="s2">have a big breakfast and then also if</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.190" end="00:52:25.660" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling particularly anxious try</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.229" end="00:52:28.269" style="s2">eating something not carbohydrates and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.660" end="00:52:31.420" style="s2">see if that helps because you you might</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.269" end="00:52:34.749" style="s2">be somewhat permanently dysregulated in</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.420" end="00:52:36.699" style="s2">your insulin stress related insulin</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.749" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">production that would be worth trying I</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.699" end="00:52:40.989" style="s2">would also say that you should shield</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:43.690" style="s2">yourself to some degree from news</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.989" end="00:52:46.839" style="s2">sources and sources of bad news</p>

<p begin="00:53:18.860" end="00:53:23.780" style="s2">isn&#39;t operating right now by the way to</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.609" end="00:56:37.150" style="s2">right is Jesus that&#39;s a tough question</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.520" end="00:56:38.589" style="s2">you know my dad&#39;s a hunter he has to</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.609" end="00:56:52.030" style="s2">culture and people take their guns</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.990" end="00:56:54.010" style="s2">seriously there and it is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.030" end="00:56:56.230" style="s2">part of their lifestyle I mean my dad&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.010" end="00:56:57.819" style="s2">hunted his whole life and we ate wild</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.230" end="00:57:01.390" style="s2">meat almost all the time I was growing</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.819" end="00:57:05.050" style="s2">up I think that the right to bear arms</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.390" end="00:57:07.559" style="s2">is one of the markers of a free society</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.050" end="00:57:09.089" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable that only</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.559" end="00:57:11.869" style="s2">the police and the army should be</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.089" end="00:57:18.599" style="s2">allowed to be dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.869" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">having said that well I think I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.599" end="00:57:23.519" style="s2">leave it at that I mean I feel obligated</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:25.079" style="s2">in some sense to go farther especially</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.519" end="00:57:29.130" style="s2">with regards to what happened in Las</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.079" end="00:57:30.689" style="s2">Vegas but it seems to me that most of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.130" end="00:57:32.789" style="s2">what happens after these mass shootings</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.689" end="00:57:35.189" style="s2">is that the event gets absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.789" end="00:57:37.619" style="s2">politicized and people take their</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.189" end="00:57:42.709" style="s2">standard positions and there&#39;s no moving</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.619" end="00:57:42.709" style="s2">either side and that&#39;s too bad but</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.849" end="00:57:53.499" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s unfortunate to use an</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.339" end="00:57:55.329" style="s2">event like the Las Vegas event or the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.499" end="00:57:57.460" style="s2">Columbine shootings to make political</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.329" end="00:57:59.769" style="s2">capital and I think that&#39;s usually what</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.460" end="00:58:01.630" style="s2">happens and so I&#39;m not going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.769" end="00:58:03.489" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an important right I</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.630" end="00:58:05.319" style="s2">believe that the individual should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.489" end="00:58:07.799" style="s2">allowed or even encouraged to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.319" end="00:58:09.749" style="s2">dangerous but controlled you know so</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.799" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">along with that right is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.749" end="00:58:15.009" style="s2">responsibility and and I guess maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:16.989" style="s2">from the NRA there should be more</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.009" end="00:58:19.359" style="s2">discussion of responsibility is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.989" end="00:58:22.499" style="s2">possible that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.359" end="00:58:22.499" style="s2">reasonable so</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.670" end="00:58:37.020" style="s2">any advice for a person with intense</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.890" end="00:58:43.740" style="s2">chronic pain that wants to become who</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.020" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2">wants to become a oh sorry it&#39;s switched</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.740" end="00:58:46.950" style="s2">on me oh there we go</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:48.600" style="s2">Crayola sheep says any advice for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.950" end="00:58:50.130" style="s2">person with intense chronic pain who</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.600" end="00:58:52.320" style="s2">wants to become a contributing member of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.130" end="00:58:54.060" style="s2">society specifically having the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.320" end="00:58:56.430" style="s2">self-discipline to push through pain to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.060" end="00:58:57.780" style="s2">take care of responsibilities well the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.430" end="00:59:00.420" style="s2">first thing I would say is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.780" end="00:59:01.980" style="s2">have intense chronic pain then my heart</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.420" end="00:59:04.590" style="s2">goes out to you because that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.980" end="00:59:06.540" style="s2">awful and so I think that you can cut</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.590" end="00:59:10.350" style="s2">yourself a break I think the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.540" end="00:59:11.910" style="s2">you want to become or continue being a</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.350" end="00:59:13.890" style="s2">contributing member to society of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.910" end="00:59:16.080" style="s2">society as a testament to your fortitude</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.890" end="00:59:17.880" style="s2">I guess the first thing I would ask you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.080" end="00:59:20.010" style="s2">is if your pain has been reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.880" end="00:59:21.420" style="s2">managed you probably know this and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.010" end="00:59:23.880" style="s2">not giving you any medical advice</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.420" end="00:59:26.430" style="s2">because I can&#39;t but you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.880" end="00:59:28.620" style="s2">note that there are antidepressants that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.430" end="00:59:30.360" style="s2">are quite effective as long-term pain</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.620" end="00:59:32.820" style="s2">medications and you may already know</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.360" end="00:59:34.080" style="s2">that but if you don&#39;t then you should</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.820" end="00:59:36.090" style="s2">check that out because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.080" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">addictive and they can be a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.090" end="00:59:41.010" style="s2">effective adjunct I would also say that</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:43.380" style="s2">the literature on chronic pain tends to</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.010" end="00:59:45.900" style="s2">indicate that more activity is better</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.380" end="00:59:47.400" style="s2">than less and that and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.900" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">because when you get engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.400" end="00:59:54.870" style="s2">something that&#39;s meaningful let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:57.030" style="s2">and important to you that that activates</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.870" end="00:59:59.310" style="s2">the dopaminergic system the same system</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.030" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">that cocaine activates and that can</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.310" end="01:00:03.600" style="s2">produce a fairly pronounced analgesic</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:06.090" style="s2">effect so I would say everything that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.600" end="01:00:07.710" style="s2">you can do to get yourself occupied with</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.090" end="01:00:09.180" style="s2">things that you regard is important and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.710" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">worthwhile is actually probably going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.180" end="01:00:15.030" style="s2">help you manage your pain better it</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:17.130" style="s2">looks like inactivity is a bad is bad</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.030" end="01:00:19.080" style="s2">generally speaking for chronic pain I</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.130" end="01:00:21.360" style="s2">mean obviously that&#39;s not the case if</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.080" end="01:00:24.800" style="s2">the sort of activity that you&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.360" end="01:00:27.090" style="s2">in is of the type that will aggravate an</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:06.460" style="s2">sort of thing you could read that book</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.110" end="01:03:09.520" style="s2">and see if there are places that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.460" end="01:03:12.690" style="s2">could put what he advises in schools for</p>

<p begin="01:03:39.869" end="01:03:43.950" style="s2">know the answer that I wouldn&#39;t say it</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.190" end="01:03:46.920" style="s2">was a moment I know that from the time I</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.950" end="01:03:49.080" style="s2">was about 16 till the time that I was 24</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.920" end="01:03:51.750" style="s2">so I had recurrent nightmares about</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.080" end="01:03:53.670" style="s2">nuclear war and so that was certainly</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.750" end="01:03:57.630" style="s2">part of it and they were very vivid and</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.670" end="01:04:01.040" style="s2">very realistic and so and certainly my</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.630" end="01:04:05.220" style="s2">reading especially about the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.040" end="01:04:07.290" style="s2">also and then later Solzhenitsyn&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.290" end="01:04:13.770" style="s2">example the horrors there that was also</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.990" end="01:04:15.480" style="s2">a major contributor it was my concern</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.770" end="01:04:17.940" style="s2">about the Cold War I would say that was</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.480" end="01:04:20.190" style="s2">really the trigger in general because I</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.940" end="01:04:21.720" style="s2">wanted to understand I took a political</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.190" end="01:04:24.420" style="s2">science degree first and looked at it</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.720" end="01:04:26.130" style="s2">from a political perspective but most of</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.420" end="01:04:28.380" style="s2">my professors by the time I was in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.130" end="01:04:30.840" style="s2">third or fourth year insisted that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.380" end="01:04:33.030" style="s2">reason that people fought the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.840" end="01:04:35.400" style="s2">that people thought were economic and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.030" end="01:04:37.100" style="s2">never did believe that because well</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.400" end="01:04:40.530" style="s2">people fight about the things they value</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.100" end="01:04:43.650" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t obvious like why people</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.530" end="01:04:46.230" style="s2">value the things they value you know so</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.650" end="01:04:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a psychological issue as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.230" end="01:04:52.490" style="s2">concerned with a known an economic issue</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.450" end="01:04:54.180" style="s2">and so it was my discomfort</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.490" end="01:04:56.070" style="s2">dissatisfaction with the standard</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.180" end="01:04:57.810" style="s2">political science viewpoint or economic</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.070" end="01:04:59.940" style="s2">viewpoint combined with this strange</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.810" end="01:05:01.800" style="s2">obsession I had about the Cold War</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.940" end="01:05:04.140" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s associated to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.800" end="01:05:07.230" style="s2">with my proclivity to depression I mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.140" end="01:05:09.390" style="s2">who knows you know I don&#39;t know I was</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.230" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">obsessed with it and it isn&#39;t obvious</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.390" end="01:05:14.700" style="s2">why things gripped you and shaky like a</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:16.140" style="s2">rat you know I guess something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.700" end="01:05:17.910" style="s2">something about that that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.140" end="01:05:22.920" style="s2">associated with what people used to call</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.910" end="01:05:25.740" style="s2">destiny so but it certainly wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.920" end="01:05:28.050" style="s2">obsession when I was 23 or 24 when I</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.740" end="01:05:30.060" style="s2">started writing maps of meaning I was</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.050" end="01:05:32.850" style="s2">thinking about it 16 hours a day at like</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.060" end="01:05:34.859" style="s2">top speed just non-stop and the only</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.850" end="01:05:37.140" style="s2">relief I could get from it really was to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.859" end="01:05:37.700" style="s2">go work out with weights which I did for</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.140" end="01:05:40.070" style="s2">quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.700" end="01:05:41.690" style="s2">long time gained about 35 pounds in</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.690" end="01:05:45.350" style="s2">weights and I had to quit because I was</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.550" end="01:05:49.250" style="s2">eating so much was taking up like half</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.350" end="01:05:53.390" style="s2">my life so anyways I don&#39;t know what it</p>

<p begin="01:05:55.700" end="01:06:01.490" style="s2">soul no and why it&#39;s there maybe it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.780" end="01:06:03.650" style="s2">also the fact that I could see in myself</p>

<p begin="01:06:03.650" end="01:06:09.050" style="s2">do terrible things and I was also very</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.040" end="01:06:11.000" style="s2">very curious about that so maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.050" end="01:06:12.200" style="s2">was an encounter with the Union shadow</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.000" end="01:06:14.600" style="s2">it was something like that</p>

<p begin="01:10:24.020" end="01:10:30.619" style="s2">unearned wisdom and I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.540" end="01:10:32.510" style="s2">wise so anyways I hope that we continue</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.619" end="01:10:35.300" style="s2">investigating them scientifically</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.510" end="01:10:38.179" style="s2">because there&#39;s much to be learned there</p>

<p begin="01:10:38.179" end="01:10:40.780" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned</p>

<p begin="01:11:17.739" end="01:11:22.599" style="s2">that&#39;s all I can say about that you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.989" end="01:11:24.820" style="s2">I I do young it Carl Jung had some</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.599" end="01:11:26.349" style="s2">strange ideas and and one of them was</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.820" end="01:11:28.030" style="s2">synchronicity you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.349" end="01:11:31.239" style="s2">things could line up in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.030" end="01:11:33.039" style="s2">seemed meaningful and you know much as I</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.239" end="01:11:35.170" style="s2">don&#39;t understand how that occurs I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.039" end="01:11:37.420" style="s2">experienced it many many times and in</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.170" end="01:11:39.250" style="s2">very convincing ways and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.420" end="01:11:40.809" style="s2">one of the things that leads me to think</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.250" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">that the world isn&#39;t structured the way</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.809" end="01:11:44.320" style="s2">that we think it is I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:46.719" style="s2">structured more like a symphony where</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.320" end="01:11:49.300" style="s2">we&#39;re and there are times when discs</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.719" end="01:11:51.010" style="s2">different parts of the world different</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.300" end="01:11:53.679" style="s2">parts of being can come into harmony</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.010" end="01:11:57.219" style="s2">spontaneously and all point in the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.679" end="01:12:02.429" style="s2">direction and why that happens I have no</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.219" end="01:12:02.429" style="s2">idea I don&#39;t understand it at all so</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.550" end="01:12:15.670" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s go back to their</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.420" end="01:14:48.850" style="s2">in the 1960s for example and or and you</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.850" end="01:14:52.630" style="s2">like the labor movement that had real</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.640" end="01:15:17.590" style="s2">and I mean there is room for an</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.230" end="01:15:19.570" style="s2">egalitarian oriented ethos but that</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.590" end="01:15:21.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t what equity is this has become</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.570" end="01:15:24.280" style="s2">completely ideological and there&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="01:15:24.280" end="01:15:27.480" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.519" end="01:15:41.019" style="s2">if you plan on doing meetups with more</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.860" end="01:15:44.559" style="s2">intellectuals like Camille and and Sam</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.019" end="01:15:46.570" style="s2">Harris who would be your pick um well</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.559" end="01:15:48.460" style="s2">I&#39;m going to meet Jonathan hi</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.570" end="01:15:50.619" style="s2">that would be good I really admire his</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.460" end="01:15:52.090" style="s2">work I think he&#39;s a really good guy so</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.619" end="01:15:55.150" style="s2">I&#39;m looking forward to talking to him</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.090" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">I&#39;d like to talk to Thomas soul I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.150" end="01:16:01.329" style="s2">it&#39;s soul I think that would be</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:04.119" style="s2">interesting the rest of it I have to</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.329" end="01:16:05.739" style="s2">think more about that I mean but those</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.119" end="01:16:07.119" style="s2">are two that I would definitely like to</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.739" end="01:16:08.980" style="s2">talk to you I&#39;m going to speak with</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.119" end="01:16:12.699" style="s2">charcoal Willie I think I mentioned that</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.980" end="01:16:14.619" style="s2">so that might be interesting will there</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.699" end="01:16:16.809" style="s2">be a third talk with Sam Harris maybe</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.619" end="01:16:19.329" style="s2">this time with Sam is he your guest and</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.809" end="01:16:21.460" style="s2">you taking your gloves off I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.329" end="01:16:22.869" style="s2">any plans for a third talk with Sam I</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.460" end="01:16:25.119" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be opposed to it although I</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.869" end="01:16:27.039" style="s2">think we I think we probably got about</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.119" end="01:16:28.690" style="s2">as far as we were going to get in our</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.039" end="01:16:30.309" style="s2">second discussion I think the two</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.690" end="01:16:37.360" style="s2">discussions together actually worked</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.309" end="01:16:40.179" style="s2">quite well so I think I think and this</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.360" end="01:16:41.800" style="s2">is no I&#39;m not saying this in any</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.179" end="01:16:44.349" style="s2">negative way but I think a third</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.800" end="01:16:48.820" style="s2">discussion might be might be beating a</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.349" end="01:16:50.679" style="s2">dead horse and like I&#39;m not interested</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.820" end="01:16:53.349" style="s2">in particularly in putting Sam on the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.679" end="01:16:54.940" style="s2">spot and you know and it&#39;s also possible</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.349" end="01:16:56.440" style="s2">that he would put me on the spot it</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.940" end="01:16:58.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily that I would come out</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.440" end="01:17:01.239" style="s2">victorious so to speak I mean he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.630" end="01:17:03.099" style="s2">very sharp guy and there&#39;s many you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.239" end="01:17:04.840" style="s2">compelling arguments to be made in favor</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.099" end="01:17:08.679" style="s2">of atheism even though I think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.840" end="01:17:11.920" style="s2">overall it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a stance</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.679" end="01:17:14.499" style="s2">that lacks I don&#39;t think it contends</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:16.570" style="s2">with its opponent fairly because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.499" end="01:17:19.090" style="s2">think that the atheist community in</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.570" end="01:17:20.889" style="s2">general takes the thought of serious</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.090" end="01:17:24.119" style="s2">religious thinkers seriously I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.889" end="01:17:24.119" style="s2">they tend to strawman</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.289" end="01:17:29.289" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.540" end="01:17:34.110" style="s2">could you please offer advice for</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.370" end="01:17:35.700" style="s2">individuals with high intelligence but</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.110" end="01:17:37.500" style="s2">low extraversion and low agreeableness</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.700" end="01:17:42.060" style="s2">and making and maintaining social</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.500" end="01:17:47.430" style="s2">connections and friendships well I would</p>

<p begin="01:17:47.430" end="01:17:55.020" style="s2">plan again spend some time on it weekly</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.080" end="01:17:56.340" style="s2">go to things like meetups there&#39;s a site</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.020" end="01:17:58.020" style="s2">called meetup.com</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.340" end="01:17:59.670" style="s2">that&#39;s a good place to meet people do</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.020" end="01:18:02.520" style="s2">whatever you have to do meet people take</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.670" end="01:18:04.920" style="s2">a course strike up a conversation you</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.520" end="01:18:06.450" style="s2">know and ask questions and listen that</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.920" end="01:18:09.090" style="s2">that&#39;s particularly good if you&#39;re low</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.450" end="01:18:11.310" style="s2">and agreeableness people really like to</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.090" end="01:18:12.930" style="s2">be listened to you know you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.310" end="01:18:15.300" style="s2">to pester them with questions too badly</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.930" end="01:18:16.800" style="s2">but you can get an awful long ways by</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.300" end="01:18:19.200" style="s2">listening to people and asking them</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.800" end="01:18:20.550" style="s2">questions so people hardly ever get</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.200" end="01:18:24.170" style="s2">listened to and they&#39;re so damn help</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.550" end="01:18:26.820" style="s2">happy when you do it that that that</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.170" end="01:18:30.360" style="s2">they&#39;re likely to open themselves up to</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.820" end="01:18:32.160" style="s2">you very very rapidly so get them</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.360" end="01:18:33.900" style="s2">talking and when they say something you</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.160" end="01:18:36.630" style="s2">don&#39;t quite catch or understand and ask</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.900" end="01:18:39.450" style="s2">them about it and and that can help you</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.630" end="01:18:41.040" style="s2">move forward but put some time into it</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.450" end="01:18:44.580" style="s2">like you need to be going out at least</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.040" end="01:18:46.470" style="s2">once a week and find some social places</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.580" end="01:18:47.850" style="s2">that you can go to regularly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.470" end="01:18:49.800" style="s2">another thing you can do you know is</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.850" end="01:18:51.540" style="s2">that pick a couple of hangouts like a</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.800" end="01:18:54.030" style="s2">local bar or something like that or</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.540" end="01:18:56.490" style="s2">whatever but go there regularly and say</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.030" end="01:18:58.650" style="s2">hi to the people who own it and run it</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.490" end="01:19:00.270" style="s2">and you know eventually you&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.650" end="01:19:02.130" style="s2">regular and then you can start to meet</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.270" end="01:19:03.750" style="s2">people by doing that but you know it</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.130" end="01:19:07.770" style="s2">might take you two or three years to get</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.750" end="01:19:11.400" style="s2">good at it I&#39;ve seen people go to go</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.770" end="01:19:13.350" style="s2">from being afraid to strike up to have a</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.400" end="01:19:15.540" style="s2">conversation with a friend in a in a</p>

<p begin="01:19:21.780" end="01:19:30.660" style="s2">you make a long-term plan so okay John</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.360" end="01:19:32.280" style="s2">damn I&#39;ve only got three dogs after that</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.660" end="01:19:34.170" style="s2">says how should a manager use the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.280" end="01:19:36.750" style="s2">perrito principle in his favour at work</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.170" end="01:19:39.330" style="s2">I find myself constantly focusing on the</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.750" end="01:19:41.910" style="s2">bottom five 20% that causes 89</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.330" end="01:19:44.340" style="s2">85% of the team support performance oh</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.910" end="01:19:46.400" style="s2">that&#39;s easy the managerial literature</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.340" end="01:19:49.110" style="s2">the solid managerial literature is</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.400" end="01:19:50.640" style="s2">absolutely crystal clear on this spend</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.110" end="01:19:53.250" style="s2">all your time with your highest</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.640" end="01:19:54.840" style="s2">producers and put your lowest producers</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.840" end="01:19:59.430" style="s2">damage the probability that as a manager</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.210" end="01:20:02.370" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be able to solve the</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.430" end="01:20:05.610" style="s2">problems of the poorest 5 to 20 percent</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.370" end="01:20:07.290" style="s2">of your work team is zero you just don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:20:08.220" end="01:20:13.890" style="s2">so what you should Jen definitely do in</p>

<p begin="01:20:13.890" end="01:20:17.730" style="s2">concentrate on your top performers I</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.780" end="01:20:20.010" style="s2">know that&#39;s not what managers do they do</p>

<p begin="01:20:20.010" end="01:20:23.880" style="s2">bottom five to twenty percent but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.260" end="01:20:26.130" style="s2">exactly the wrong thing to do as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.880" end="01:20:27.690" style="s2">manager focus on your best people</p>

<p begin="01:21:07.740" end="01:21:11.970" style="s2">need at least 90 minutes a week to think</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.040" end="01:21:43.180" style="s2">glass no I think I said that I was I</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.810" end="01:21:45.130" style="s2">always felt like I was dancing on broken</p>

<p begin="01:21:45.130" end="01:21:49.690" style="s2">R&amp;R is the food sensitivity getting</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.860" end="01:21:51.489" style="s2">worked out I think maybe the food</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.690" end="01:21:53.980" style="s2">sensitivity thing is getting worked out</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.489" end="01:21:56.380" style="s2">I think it&#39;s out the basis of this</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.980" end="01:21:59.199" style="s2">depression that&#39;s been plaguing my</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.380" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">family for generations but I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.199" end="01:22:03.010" style="s2">figured out exactly what it is yet</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.360" end="01:22:04.780" style="s2">I&#39;m working very hard on that with my</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.010" end="01:22:06.969" style="s2">daughter who also seems to have the same</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.780" end="01:22:11.380" style="s2">problem and it is absolutely brutal</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.969" end="01:22:14.320" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely brutal so am I getting</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.380" end="01:22:16.780" style="s2">enough rest in R&amp;R that&#39;s hard to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.320" end="01:22:18.190" style="s2">because with the responses that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.780" end="01:22:20.320" style="s2">been having that have knocked my health</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.190" end="01:22:22.960" style="s2">back it&#39;s hard to discriminate between</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.320" end="01:22:25.810" style="s2">West and R&amp;R the lack of that and just</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.960" end="01:22:28.840" style="s2">getting walloped by by eating what</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.810" end="01:22:30.699" style="s2">appears to be the wrong thing so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.840" end="01:22:34.020" style="s2">funny because you know for years I was</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.699" end="01:22:36.370" style="s2">very skeptical of anyone who was</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.020" end="01:22:38.199" style="s2">concerned about you know gluten</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.370" end="01:22:42.630" style="s2">sensitivity and that sort of thing but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.199" end="01:22:45.370" style="s2">sure learned that that was arrogant so</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.630" end="01:22:47.380" style="s2">yeah well I found many times in my life</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.370" end="01:22:49.630" style="s2">that you have to be aware of what you</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.380" end="01:22:53.580" style="s2">are judgmental about because many things</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.630" end="01:22:53.580" style="s2">come back to haunt you so</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.659" end="01:23:03.380" style="s2">dr. Peterson do you have suggestions for</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.880" end="01:23:05.329" style="s2">how to make a schedule that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.380" end="01:23:06.769" style="s2">you a tyrant I&#39;ve watched your previous</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.329" end="01:23:08.929" style="s2">videos put them struggling to make the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.769" end="01:23:12.130" style="s2">weekly schedule that is productive hey</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.929" end="01:23:15.889" style="s2">Joshua start by making a weekly schedule</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.130" end="01:23:17.869" style="s2">that you want really like imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.889" end="01:23:19.699" style="s2">you&#39;re designing your schedule so that</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.869" end="01:23:21.800" style="s2">you can have the life you want just</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.699" end="01:23:23.659" style="s2">start with that like and be easy on</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.800" end="01:23:25.039" style="s2">yourself to begin with you know you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.659" end="01:23:27.579" style="s2">get better at it you can have more</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.039" end="01:23:32.179" style="s2">responsibilities as you as you practice</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.579" end="01:23:33.559" style="s2">so so start by just scheduling in a few</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.179" end="01:23:35.780" style="s2">things that you&#39;d like to do and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.559" end="01:23:38.179" style="s2">load it up over time but remember like</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.780" end="01:23:40.999" style="s2">get get your attitude right I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.179" end="01:23:42.709" style="s2">this schedule so that I can have the</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.999" end="01:23:45.590" style="s2">days and the weeks and the months that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.709" end="01:23:47.780" style="s2">would make my life that would optimize</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.590" end="01:23:49.579" style="s2">my life right not so that I should do</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.780" end="01:23:51.380" style="s2">what I need to get done I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.579" end="01:23:54.909" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.380" end="01:23:54.909" style="s2">right goal so</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.510" end="01:24:02.910" style="s2">what are you thoughts on students taking</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.550" end="01:24:06.490" style="s2">adderall are there any long-term effects</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.910" end="01:24:09.310" style="s2">there are long-term studies of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.490" end="01:24:11.710" style="s2">utility of adderall for attention</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.310" end="01:24:13.870" style="s2">deficit disorder hyperactivity and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.710" end="01:24:16.090" style="s2">results are basically negative there is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.870" end="01:24:18.880" style="s2">no evidence that the medications help</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.090" end="01:24:22.330" style="s2">with academic performance over the long</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.880" end="01:24:24.610" style="s2">run I think that adderall is an</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.330" end="01:24:27.100" style="s2">amphetamine it is addictive it cannot</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.610" end="01:24:29.950" style="s2">sensitize you to other dopamine agonists</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.100" end="01:24:31.960" style="s2">so I would generally say it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.950" end="01:24:34.060" style="s2">to be avoided you also want to really</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.960" end="01:24:36.670" style="s2">watch it in combination with marijuana</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.060" end="01:24:38.560" style="s2">for example or psychedelics because you</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.670" end="01:24:40.330" style="s2">can get unlucky and trigger a psychotic</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.560" end="01:24:42.850" style="s2">episode and that is not a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.330" end="01:24:44.950" style="s2">because once you have one psychotic</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.850" end="01:24:46.300" style="s2">episode you&#39;re a bit on the broken side</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.950" end="01:24:50.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to put yourself back</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.300" end="01:24:54.130" style="s2">together so I would say use it sparingly</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.440" end="01:24:55.840" style="s2">if at all it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a good plan</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.130" end="01:25:03.400" style="s2">and especially not something good to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.840" end="01:25:04.960" style="s2">doing eventually so any reading tips for</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.400" end="01:25:06.160" style="s2">becoming teachers who don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.960" end="01:25:08.470" style="s2">corrupted by the current teacher</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.160" end="01:25:10.180" style="s2">education at the universities well I</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.470" end="01:25:12.400" style="s2">would say you know you can I have a</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.180" end="01:25:14.470" style="s2">reading list on my book on my website</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.400" end="01:25:15.910" style="s2">Jordan V Peterson calm you could go look</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.470" end="01:25:18.460" style="s2">there I&#39;m gonna add some more books to</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.910" end="01:25:20.800" style="s2">it read as much classic literature as</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.460" end="01:25:24.190" style="s2">you can read history like go into the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.800" end="01:25:26.200" style="s2">libraries and and and look at great</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.190" end="01:25:28.630" style="s2">books programs that&#39;s what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.200" end="01:25:30.190" style="s2">and you have to educate yourself at the</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.630" end="01:25:31.750" style="s2">University you know I mean that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.190" end="01:25:37.750" style="s2">being the case and it&#39;s even more the</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.750" end="01:25:40.600" style="s2">case now is is go back and go back and</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.750" end="01:25:43.030" style="s2">read great literature great philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.600" end="01:25:45.270" style="s2">great thinkers and you will learn a</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.030" end="01:25:47.320" style="s2">tremendous amount that way and I I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.270" end="01:25:48.970" style="s2">otherwise there&#39;s no way you can avoid</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.320" end="01:25:50.980" style="s2">being corrupted by the current teacher</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.970" end="01:25:52.710" style="s2">education and universities the education</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.980" end="01:25:57.030" style="s2">faculties are absolutely dreadful</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.710" end="01:25:57.030" style="s2">absolutely dreadful so</p>

<p begin="01:26:19.080" end="01:26:26.010" style="s2">conscientiousness yeah well how old are</p>

<p begin="01:26:29.550" end="01:26:34.260" style="s2">people are less conscientious so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.320" end="01:26:35.790" style="s2">one thing to keep in mind if you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.260" end="01:26:37.800" style="s2">open like that you need to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.790" end="01:26:39.030" style="s2">something creative but you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.800" end="01:26:41.280" style="s2">to learn how to discipline yourself</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.030" end="01:26:42.930" style="s2">there&#39;s just no way around it and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.280" end="01:26:45.480" style="s2">would say go do the Future authoring</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.930" end="01:26:47.250" style="s2">program that&#39;s a good start and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.480" end="01:26:49.830" style="s2">have to learn how to schedule your time</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.250" end="01:26:51.150" style="s2">and how to get up at the same time every</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.830" end="01:26:54.480" style="s2">day and it&#39;s gonna be a real struggle</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.150" end="01:26:56.040" style="s2">but you know you you can do it I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.480" end="01:26:57.870" style="s2">students who are very high in openness</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.040" end="01:26:59.100" style="s2">and low in conscientiousness as graduate</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.870" end="01:27:00.570" style="s2">students and they discipline themselves</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.100" end="01:27:01.860" style="s2">you need to find something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.570" end="01:27:03.930" style="s2">really interested in that you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.860" end="01:27:08.250" style="s2">to pursue and then you have to hit it</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.930" end="01:27:09.810" style="s2">hard so that&#39;s what I would say but do</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.250" end="01:27:11.400" style="s2">the Future Oxford program and get</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.810" end="01:27:14.520" style="s2">yourself a plan and start to implement</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.400" end="01:27:15.690" style="s2">it and every time you fall astray then</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.520" end="01:27:17.520" style="s2">get back at it</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.690" end="01:27:19.530" style="s2">and you know you may have to build up</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.520" end="01:27:24.170" style="s2">your conscientiousness over a number of</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.530" end="01:27:24.170" style="s2">years and but it&#39;s worth doing so</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.410" end="01:27:34.680" style="s2">my favorite Tom Waits song I really like</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.440" end="01:27:36.270" style="s2">cold water my son does a vicious version</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.680" end="01:27:43.020" style="s2">of cold water but I really like cold</p>

<p begin="01:30:19.790" end="01:30:24.270" style="s2">carefully and if they refuse to listen</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.530" end="01:30:26.250" style="s2">and just like put up an impenetrable</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.270" end="01:30:27.720" style="s2">wall then you shut the hell up and go</p>

<p begin="01:30:44.670" end="01:30:51.030" style="s2">so you could also turn from convincing</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.660" end="01:30:54.660" style="s2">to questioning you know if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.030" end="01:30:56.220" style="s2">very very set in their views instead of</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.660" end="01:30:58.290" style="s2">opposing them you can ask them to</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.220" end="01:30:59.940" style="s2">elucidate their views and you can use</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.290" end="01:31:03.120" style="s2">that questioning process it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.940" end="01:31:05.040" style="s2">Socratic dialogue to dig into their</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.120" end="01:31:06.870" style="s2">fundamental principles and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.040" end="01:31:14.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of opening up a space</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.870" end="01:31:16.740" style="s2">for dialogue so what do you make of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.520" end="01:31:18.750" style="s2">Gnostic Gospels for example the Gospel</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.740" end="01:31:20.100" style="s2">of Thomas well I&#39;ve read the Gospel of</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.750" end="01:31:23.280" style="s2">Thomas and I think it&#39;s a remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.100" end="01:31:24.630" style="s2">document there are things in it that are</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.280" end="01:31:27.210" style="s2">extraordinarily powerful</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.630" end="01:31:28.380" style="s2">I closed maps of meaning in fact the</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.210" end="01:31:30.810" style="s2">book I wrote in nineteen</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.380" end="01:31:33.360" style="s2">you know with a quotation from the</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.810" end="01:31:34.860" style="s2">Gospel of Thomas it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.360" end="01:31:37.350" style="s2">too that the first person who got his</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.860" end="01:31:38.940" style="s2">hands on that gospel was Carl Jung which</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.350" end="01:31:40.560" style="s2">I think is an amazing example of</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.940" end="01:31:44.000" style="s2">synchronicity right the first of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.560" end="01:31:46.710" style="s2">Gnostic Gospels that was what released</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.000" end="01:31:48.810" style="s2">into the broader world ended up in Carl</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.710" end="01:31:53.400" style="s2">Jung&#39;s hands absolutely amazing</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.810" end="01:31:58.139" style="s2">historical fact so they seem to me to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.400" end="01:32:00.179" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting and I read</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.139" end="01:32:01.920" style="s2">them I suppose in some ways the same way</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.179" end="01:32:03.840" style="s2">that I read the canonical Bible I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.920" end="01:32:05.699" style="s2">trying to extract out what wisdom there</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.840" end="01:32:07.620" style="s2">is in them or what wisdom I can</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.699" end="01:32:13.620" style="s2">understand anyways and utilize it to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.620" end="01:32:15.540" style="s2">degree that I can so in one of your</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.620" end="01:32:17.489" style="s2">videos you mentioned about the power</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.540" end="01:32:19.139" style="s2">that creates order from chaos but can</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.489" end="01:32:21.630" style="s2">also create chaos from pathological</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.139" end="01:32:24.570" style="s2">order can you expand and explain the</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.630" end="01:32:28.610" style="s2">latter one well the logos that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.570" end="01:32:30.989" style="s2">human capacity for consciousness and and</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.610" end="01:32:33.420" style="s2">communication and and awareness and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.989" end="01:32:34.850" style="s2">think that it&#39;s it&#39;s actually the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.420" end="01:32:37.290" style="s2">actually one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.850" end="01:32:38.850" style="s2">prerequisites for being itself right</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.290" end="01:32:40.830" style="s2">which is one of the things that makes me</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.850" end="01:32:43.080" style="s2">different from a standard materialist I</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.830" end="01:32:45.030" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe that there can be being</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.080" end="01:32:47.040" style="s2">without consciousness and so I think if</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.030" end="01:32:50.340" style="s2">consciousness is a primary element of</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.040" end="01:32:52.880" style="s2">well reality that&#39;s its irreducible</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.340" end="01:32:55.139" style="s2">element of reality something like that a</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.880" end="01:32:57.300" style="s2">prerequisite for reality that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.139" end="01:33:00.810" style="s2">way of thinking about it and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.300" end="01:33:02.639" style="s2">logos essentially and it&#39;s respect for</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.810" end="01:33:04.920" style="s2">the logos I would say that&#39;s the deepest</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.639" end="01:33:09.750" style="s2">doctrine of them of the biblical stories</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.920" end="01:33:12.420" style="s2">now what does the logos do well you can</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.750" end="01:33:14.130" style="s2">see this in Christ&#39;s story most</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.420" end="01:33:16.489" style="s2">particularly so Christ is often</p>

<p begin="01:33:16.489" end="01:33:23.940" style="s2">cast I suppose in the same mold as Moses</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.850" end="01:33:26.280" style="s2">you know Moses Moses opposed the</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.940" end="01:33:29.330" style="s2">Egyptian tyranny like Christ opposed the</p>

<p begin="01:33:29.330" end="01:33:35.520" style="s2">and Moses produced chaos as a</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.510" end="01:33:37.889" style="s2">consequence of opposing the tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.520" end="01:33:38.370" style="s2">right he first chaos was the crossing of</p>

<p begin="01:33:38.370" end="01:33:41.970" style="s2">Moses was a master of water and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.320" end="01:33:44.810" style="s2">the same symbolically as being the</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.970" end="01:33:47.730" style="s2">master of chaos but after he freed the</p>

<p begin="01:33:47.730" end="01:33:53.310" style="s2">they entered a period that was 40 years</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.680" end="01:33:55.440" style="s2">long so the story goes almost on almost</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.310" end="01:33:58.500" style="s2">complete chaos right abandonment in a</p>

<p begin="01:36:28.300" end="01:36:31.810" style="s2">like ours discipline is extremely</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.890" end="01:36:33.850" style="s2">important and so I think that being able</p>

<p begin="01:36:33.850" end="01:36:38.650" style="s2">orderly to some degree is necessary but</p>

<p begin="01:36:41.080" end="01:36:46.810" style="s2">a break and have some fun I think you</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.290" end="01:36:48.940" style="s2">could risk becoming over committed to</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.810" end="01:36:52.080" style="s2">your work or to your endeavor so I do</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.940" end="01:36:54.430" style="s2">think that that&#39;s something that I risk</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.080" end="01:36:57.150" style="s2">maybe I trained myself to be too</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.430" end="01:37:02.230" style="s2">industrious it&#39;s certainly possible</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.150" end="01:37:04.510" style="s2">openness well that might be a place</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.230" end="01:37:06.340" style="s2">where I have a personality predicated</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.510" end="01:37:08.980" style="s2">blind-spot because I&#39;m very very high in</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.340" end="01:37:11.530" style="s2">openness and but I do believe that</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.980" end="01:37:14.500" style="s2">there&#39;s utility in exposing yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.530" end="01:37:16.210" style="s2">the world of great ideas and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.500" end="01:37:17.950" style="s2">for everyone you know I mean there are</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.210" end="01:37:19.930" style="s2">people who are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.950" end="01:37:23.560" style="s2">conservative in their orientation and</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.930" end="01:37:25.060" style="s2">more power to them I suppose but if</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.560" end="01:37:26.830" style="s2">you&#39;re going to read then you should</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.060" end="01:37:28.099" style="s2">read great things and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.830" end="01:37:29.749" style="s2">interested in the life</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.099" end="01:37:32.179" style="s2">the intellect the philosophical life</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.749" end="01:37:34.999" style="s2">then then there&#39;s much to be learned by</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.179" end="01:37:38.479" style="s2">reading great books so so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.999" end="01:37:40.369" style="s2">that I&#39;m overwhelmingly biased with</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.479" end="01:37:42.289" style="s2">regards to my own personality but in</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.369" end="01:37:46.189" style="s2">that you never know I mean it it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.289" end="01:37:50.619" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for it&#39;s hard for someone to</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.189" end="01:37:50.619" style="s2">judge that about themselves so</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.119" end="01:38:22.610" style="s2">can one reason with a stalker my stalker</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.210" end="01:38:24.500" style="s2">is highly intelligent at rational making</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.610" end="01:38:26.150" style="s2">him scarier by beginning to work with</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.500" end="01:38:29.659" style="s2">police and lawyers but wondering if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.150" end="01:38:33.679" style="s2">have experience in this realm I would</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.659" end="01:38:37.190" style="s2">say not knowing the specifics of your</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.679" end="01:38:39.369" style="s2">situation know you can&#39;t really reason</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.190" end="01:38:44.420" style="s2">with the stalker the stalker is already</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.369" end="01:38:46.909" style="s2">gone beyond the realm of normal social</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.420" end="01:38:48.830" style="s2">behavior you know and I would say with</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.909" end="01:38:50.739" style="s2">most stalkers assuming that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.830" end="01:38:53.000" style="s2">dealing with the genuine article that</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.739" end="01:38:54.949" style="s2">they tend to be a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.000" end="01:38:56.630" style="s2">paranoid side or maybe a lot on the</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.949" end="01:38:59.210" style="s2">paranoid side and the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.630" end="01:39:02.119" style="s2">people who are paranoid is that they</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.210" end="01:39:05.179" style="s2">have adopted a couple of axioms as</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.119" end="01:39:09.619" style="s2">absolutely fixed and there&#39;s no shifting</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.179" end="01:39:11.780" style="s2">them so I would say you know I hate to</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.619" end="01:39:13.849" style="s2">give advice in a situation like that but</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.780" end="01:39:18.020" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say that the probability of</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.849" end="01:39:20.330" style="s2">using reason is precluded by the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.020" end="01:39:22.219" style="s2">the stalking behavior so good luck with</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.330" end="01:39:24.409" style="s2">it that&#39;s very scary and so it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.219" end="01:39:26.989" style="s2">for people to be protected from someone</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.409" end="01:39:29.710" style="s2">whose intent on following them and</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.989" end="01:39:32.710" style="s2">perhaps on making their life miserable</p>

<p begin="01:39:41.520" end="01:39:46.710" style="s2">well here&#39;s something that you might</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.070" end="01:39:48.540" style="s2">consider so when you&#39;re a child and</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.710" end="01:39:50.280" style="s2">you&#39;re naive then you trust people</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.540" end="01:39:51.720" style="s2">because you&#39;re naive and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.280" end="01:39:53.310" style="s2">any better and you don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.720" end="01:39:57.000" style="s2">people can hurt you unless you&#39;re a very</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.310" end="01:40:00.330" style="s2">unfortunate child so your your trust</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.000" end="01:40:02.910" style="s2">isn&#39;t a virtue it&#39;s just a sign of your</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.330" end="01:40:04.740" style="s2">innocence let&#39;s say and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.910" end="01:40:06.690" style="s2">innocence isn&#39;t a virtue it&#39;s just lack</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.740" end="01:40:10.500" style="s2">of experience but when you&#39;re older Mike</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.690" end="01:40:12.960" style="s2">courage or trust isn&#39;t is a hallmark of</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.500" end="01:40:15.030" style="s2">courage you extend your hand to people</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.960" end="01:40:16.800" style="s2">and you extend your trust to people</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.030" end="01:40:19.290" style="s2">knowing full well that you can be bit</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.800" end="01:40:21.270" style="s2">like you might be bitten by a Cobra you</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.290" end="01:40:24.240" style="s2">can be betrayed and disappointed by</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.270" end="01:40:27.420" style="s2">people but you extend your hand in trust</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.240" end="01:40:29.730" style="s2">because of courage because you decide to</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.420" end="01:40:31.710" style="s2">take the risk and by taking that risk</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.730" end="01:40:34.320" style="s2">you open the door to the best in people</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.710" end="01:40:36.330" style="s2">and but you won&#39;t see that door open</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.320" end="01:40:40.880" style="s2">unless you first take the step to trust</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.330" end="01:40:44.190" style="s2">and so I would say you have to practice</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.880" end="01:40:47.700" style="s2">trusting people you know you have to</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.190" end="01:40:50.310" style="s2">share things that are somewhat private</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.700" end="01:40:53.010" style="s2">you have to ask people for small favors</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.310" end="01:40:54.720" style="s2">and trade small favors and you have to</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.010" end="01:40:56.820" style="s2">do that knowing full well that you can</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.720" end="01:41:01.890" style="s2">get hurt so think about it as an act of</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.820" end="01:41:07.350" style="s2">courage instead of instead of naivety or</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.890" end="01:41:08.490" style="s2">or or or or well instead of naivety</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.350" end="01:41:11.720" style="s2">let&#39;s leave it at that</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.490" end="01:41:11.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I would recommend</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.570" end="01:41:21.389" style="s2">all right everyone I&#39;m going to stop so</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.960" end="01:41:23.820" style="s2">once again thank you very much for</p>

<p begin="01:41:34.440" end="01:41:39.119" style="s2">much time putting these questions</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.119" end="01:41:42.500" style="s2">together and and watching my videos and</p>
