<p begin="00:00:00.089" end="00:00:02.879" style="s2">I would imagine that many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.439" end="00:00:06.299" style="s2">who watch my videos have at least heard</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.879" end="00:00:08.790" style="s2">of game B and I&#39;ve noticed that there</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.299" end="00:00:10.019" style="s2">seems to be a perception which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:11.790" style="s2">agree with personally but anyway doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:15.500" style="s2">matter whether I agree or not the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.790" end="00:00:18.060" style="s2">perception exists that the game B</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.500" end="00:00:21.060" style="s2">conversation is somewhat impenetrable</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.060" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">for you know just average folk kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.060" end="00:00:25.470" style="s2">thing and that in order to get into it</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:27.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve had to commit to watching dozens</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.470" end="00:00:29.730" style="s2">and dozens of hours of videos and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.960" end="00:00:31.410" style="s2">listening to podcasts and so on in order</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.730" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">to acquaint yourself with B with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.410" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">idea sufficiently to understand it and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">mean there is some truth to that you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">go as deep into it as you want to but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:43.290" style="s2">think many of the key concepts that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:44.789" style="s2">the foundation of game via actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.290" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">pretty straightforward to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.789" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">so I thought it might be a good idea to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">make a series of short videos to explain</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">in fairly straightforward tones some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">those key concepts I&#39;m gonna begin by</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">outlining what game a is because game B</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">is most easily talked about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">its contrasts with what game a is and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">in this first video I&#39;m gonna sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">unpack a little bit the idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">game a is all about what the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:18.270" style="s2">characteristics of game a are and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">game B will differ from that and I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.270" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">through some of those one-by-one in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:27.240" style="s2">future videos so the game a if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">played Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization then</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.240" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a pretty decent handle on</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">what game a is I think they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">quite closely analogous and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">game civilization you start off at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">little tiny village and you go scouting</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">around you can&#39;t see any of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">surrounding territories you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">scouting around and see what&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">you come across the sources and you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:49.850" style="s2">to cultivate them and manage them your</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">population starts to grow you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.850" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">investigate technologies you have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">distribute resources so that your</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">population gets fed there are bands of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">barbarians wandering around who want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">kill you and take over your city so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">have to defend yourself against those in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:08.520" style="s2">the early part of the game as the game</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">develops and this is where game a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.520" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">comes in as the game develops you start</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">to bump into other fledgling</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:16.500" style="s2">civilizations and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:17.670" style="s2">um in order to maintain the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.500" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">your own civilization you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.670" end="00:02:20.190" style="s2">several things that I&#39;ve already said it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:23.160" style="s2">but a cultivator is also so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.190" end="00:02:25.710" style="s2">feed everyone and you have to generate</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.160" end="00:02:28.380" style="s2">loyal seeds to the civilization which</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.710" end="00:02:30.420" style="s2">you do by developing a culture you need</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.380" end="00:02:33.140" style="s2">to develop an economy so that there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.420" end="00:02:36.210" style="s2">trade going on things for people to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.140" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">you need to develop a religion so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.210" end="00:02:40.740" style="s2">people have you know a a this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:42.960" style="s2">loyalty to the culture a broader</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.740" end="00:02:44.900" style="s2">involvement in in the culture as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.960" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">not just with their immediate circles</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.900" end="00:02:51.060" style="s2">and you have to cultivate a military</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:53.070" style="s2">otherwise you get taken over by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.060" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">other civilizations and so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.070" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">pretty good analogy for what game a is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:00.990" style="s2">you know back in the day before there</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:03.420" style="s2">were civilizations hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.990" end="00:03:05.850" style="s2">tribes spread across the world took over</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.420" end="00:03:07.590" style="s2">every available niche and became the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.850" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">apex predator in each and every niche</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.590" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">but at some point they became so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">successful they started bumping into</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:14.550" style="s2">each other and all the territory was</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">already occupied and so there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.550" end="00:03:18.420" style="s2">nowhere else to go and so one of two</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.920" end="00:03:21.150" style="s2">things that had to have to either start</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.420" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">killing each other all the time or they</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.150" end="00:03:26.340" style="s2">figure out a way to exist in larger</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:28.980" style="s2">bands that they previously had done and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.340" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">so this is this as the beginning of game</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.980" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">a was the bumping together a small</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:34.860" style="s2">tribes who had to figure out ways to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">exist in larger groups where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.860" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">intimacy of relationship can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">bleep be the glue that holds them</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">together another way of doing that needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:47.880" style="s2">to be come up with and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">game a and so game a is what we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.880" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">been doing for the last twelve thousand</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">years and of course there have been very</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">very very many variations on game a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:58.230" style="s2">there&#39;s been lots of different religions</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:04:00.840" style="s2">lots of different ways of treating women</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.230" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">and slaves and so on lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.840" end="00:04:04.470" style="s2">ways of accessing water lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">different engineering skills lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.470" end="00:04:07.350" style="s2">different technologies all of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">of thing there are many ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.350" end="00:04:11.459" style="s2">game a has been extremely successful I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">mean obviously different tribes had</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:15.209" style="s2">different skill sets and different</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">knowledge about different things and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.209" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">if you can figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:23.700" style="s2">collaborate effectively then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">sudden the civilization as a whole has</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.700" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">access to all of the skills that all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:29.039" style="s2">the tribes and all of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">that rule the tribes had access to and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.039" end="00:04:33.330" style="s2">so there are huge advantages in this in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">this collaboration across scale but</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.330" end="00:04:40.050" style="s2">there are also significant externalities</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">that are produced by gamej and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.050" end="00:04:43.949" style="s2">in a way you could say that our current</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">civilization is the winner thus far of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.949" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">game a because the only one that has not</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.909" style="s2">collapsed every civilization in history</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">has collapsed the Greeks the Romans the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.909" end="00:04:55.889" style="s2">Ottomans the Egyptians the Mayans the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:04:58.949" style="s2">Incans the Sumerians you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.889" end="00:05:01.439" style="s2">these civilizations are gone now and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.949" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">ours is the latest evolution the latest</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.439" end="00:05:08.159" style="s2">refinement of game a but game a is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:10.379" style="s2">characterized by certain things you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.159" end="00:05:14.250" style="s2">all of these evolutions of game a are</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.379" end="00:05:16.379" style="s2">characterized by three basic principles</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.250" end="00:05:18.659" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I want to go into in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.379" end="00:05:20.669" style="s2">future videos each of these things might</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.659" end="00:05:25.080" style="s2">be might look like from a game B</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.669" end="00:05:26.849" style="s2">perspective you know game a has in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.080" end="00:05:28.229" style="s2">three basic ways which I&#39;ll go into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.849" end="00:05:32.330" style="s2">minute has always been basically the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.229" end="00:05:34.770" style="s2">same but what&#39;s different now is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.330" end="00:05:37.710" style="s2">level the scale the efficiency of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.770" end="00:05:41.069" style="s2">technology and so our ability to extract</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.710" end="00:05:43.469" style="s2">our ability to make or our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.069" end="00:05:45.029" style="s2">pollute has now got to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.469" end="00:05:46.770" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually become a threat to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.029" end="00:05:48.180" style="s2">ourselves and not only to ourselves but</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.770" end="00:05:51.349" style="s2">to a lot of the rest of the life on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" end="00:05:53.310" style="s2">planet as well and so these</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.349" end="00:05:55.860" style="s2">externalities that have always existed</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.310" end="00:05:57.930" style="s2">in game a have now been magnified and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:05:59.699" style="s2">amplified by technology to the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.930" end="00:06:01.949" style="s2">where they are a threat to us a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.699" end="00:06:05.009" style="s2">threat to our very existence and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.949" end="00:06:07.620" style="s2">why you need to figure out a new game to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.009" end="00:06:10.740" style="s2">play game B right whatever game B is you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.620" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">know what it actually is you know it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.740" end="00:06:15.210" style="s2">but but a new game with different</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:16.469" style="s2">parameters different fundamentals so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.210" end="00:06:18.750" style="s2">three things I&#39;m going to talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.469" end="00:06:21.779" style="s2">future videos the three characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.750" end="00:06:25.740" style="s2">that have always underpinned every</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.779" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2">iteration of game a are complicatedness</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.740" end="00:06:31.710" style="s2">and so using complicated systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.669" end="00:06:33.689" style="s2">hierarchies government rules laws these</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.710" end="00:06:36.599" style="s2">kinds of things to manage complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.689" end="00:06:38.789" style="s2">systems the environment ecosystems human</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.599" end="00:06:40.259" style="s2">beings Society and so on and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.789" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">fundamental incompatibility between</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.259" end="00:06:43.760" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:47.430" style="s2">two modes of organization so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.760" end="00:06:49.950" style="s2">second one is a top-down broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.430" end="00:06:52.230" style="s2">modality of sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.950" end="00:06:54.510" style="s2">decision-making and so a king or an</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.230" end="00:06:57.210" style="s2">emperor or a government or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.510" end="00:06:58.500" style="s2">might be decides what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.210" end="00:07:00.540" style="s2">world what&#39;s best for the civilization</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.500" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">tells everybody else what to do and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.540" end="00:07:05.060" style="s2">follow those instructions and so your</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:07.560" style="s2">role as a member of society is simply to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.060" end="00:07:09.480" style="s2">basically listen and to do as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.560" end="00:07:14.270" style="s2">told right so that&#39;s that&#39;s broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.480" end="00:07:19.410" style="s2">and then the third one is rival richness</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.270" end="00:07:20.940" style="s2">and this is basically a response to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.410" end="00:07:22.110" style="s2">fact that you know things are limited</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.940" end="00:07:24.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t have an infinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">space to grow food on you don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.480" end="00:07:27.690" style="s2">infinite amount of water you know this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:30.090" style="s2">kind of thing and so there is always</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.690" end="00:07:32.810" style="s2">competition over scarce resources and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.090" end="00:07:35.310" style="s2">this leads to a modality within the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.810" end="00:07:37.920" style="s2">civilization within the society of rival</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.310" end="00:07:43.130" style="s2">richness and this runs extremely deep so</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.920" end="00:07:46.170" style="s2">these three notions of rivalry sness and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.130" end="00:07:49.140" style="s2">broadcast modality and complicatedness</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.170" end="00:07:51.810" style="s2">are enduring features of gaming and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.140" end="00:07:55.140" style="s2">is these things which need to be turned</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.810" end="00:07:58.380" style="s2">on their heads in game be into anti</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.140" end="00:08:00.120" style="s2">rival resinous distributed decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.380" end="00:08:03.690" style="s2">sense making and decision making</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.120" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">processes and the use of complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.690" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">decision-making process in order to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:10.410" style="s2">handle the complexity of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">with which we need to deal so I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.410" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">that&#39;s about all I need to say for this</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:17.720" style="s2">one and I look forward to seeing you in</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:17.720" style="s2">future ones thanks for watching</p>
