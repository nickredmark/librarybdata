<p begin="00:00:11.160" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">all of us to think big and to explore</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.610" end="00:00:20.630" style="s2">the world around us and understand the</p>

<p begin="00:00:20.630" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at different sense making</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.550" end="00:00:29.269" style="s2">frameworks we&#39;ve learned about ecology</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">and gyein systems and rapid prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.269" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">in this course and leave it to Daniel to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:41.180" style="s2">go meta and teach us about sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">itself Daniel is a good friend and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.180" end="00:00:45.809" style="s2">student of buckminster fuller&#39;s started</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.809" end="00:00:53.309" style="s2">actually his parents would greet him</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">synergetics as bedtime stories and he</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.309" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">was kind of a protege of Fuller&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:06.680" style="s2">amongst others and just a look to you</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">you for all the response work that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">you&#39;ve been doing for this really</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">appreciate very happy to be here I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">remember when you and I first talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">about this type of course happening for</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">Bucky fuller Institute where people</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">could learn good sense making tools and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:37.470" style="s2">be able to apply them so I&#39;m just really</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:38.299" style="s2">delighted this happening now I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.470" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a great service</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.299" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah we met a great time so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">gonna explore sense-making today could</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">you pick us off with just telling us</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">some of the core principles of sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:58.009" style="s2">making and how we can maybe apply that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">to this global crisis conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.009" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">sentence making and the reason we use a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:05.159" style="s2">term like sense making is how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">sense of the world and reality that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.159" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">which is kind of a common vernacular for</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:16.500" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:18.209" style="s2">how do we go about knowing things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.500" end="00:02:22.410" style="s2">what is the basis for appropriate belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.209" end="00:02:24.870" style="s2">in something and this obviously a not</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.410" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">only the basis of the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.870" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">science which is how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:30.750" style="s2">knowing objective things about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">object of world mmm but all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.750" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">philosophy the epistemic of whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">is that we were claiming is true about</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:41.129" style="s2">anything what is our basis of our truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">claim and so someone can easily study</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.129" end="00:02:43.650" style="s2">this field for their whole life and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">scratch the surface of all the good</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.650" end="00:02:49.500" style="s2">thinking that has been done and our</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">basis for right action in the world to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.500" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">be effective at anything is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">our basis of understanding the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:57.569" style="s2">the world and the nature of being able</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:03:01.220" style="s2">to consider what the effect of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.569" end="00:03:05.099" style="s2">particular action are gonna be so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.220" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">overview of sense-making 101 like what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.099" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">hope we can do is share a few principles</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:16.410" style="s2">that are a valuable start to just add</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:18.150" style="s2">something to the picture that can also</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.410" end="00:03:21.359" style="s2">inspire people if they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:23.579" style="s2">terms of where they can go further and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.359" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">maybe be able to show the application of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.579" end="00:03:26.549" style="s2">those two things that are currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:30.269" style="s2">trending questions with regard to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.549" end="00:03:33.510" style="s2">you know covet 19 global crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.269" end="00:03:39.389" style="s2">attendant set of world issues that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.510" end="00:03:43.940" style="s2">happening so I&#39;m going to assume also</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.389" end="00:03:50.099" style="s2">that the basic philosophy of science and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.940" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">kind of basic Karl Popper sensibilities</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.099" end="00:03:53.400" style="s2">and kind of understanding of logical</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:57.359" style="s2">fallacies and critical thinking is at</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">least somewhat familiar if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.359" end="00:04:00.930" style="s2">true then take a look at those terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">that I said and at least go read the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.930" end="00:04:05.450" style="s2">Wikipedia page on them logical fallacies</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:08.549" style="s2">critical thinking philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.450" end="00:04:11.099" style="s2">popper those would be starting places</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.549" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">those are by no means an adequate frame</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.099" end="00:04:15.690" style="s2">for sense making but they are common</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:17.250" style="s2">valuable frames good starting places so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.690" end="00:04:21.150" style="s2">I&#39;m going to kind of assume those and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.250" end="00:04:22.890" style="s2">build on there if I use terms that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.150" end="00:04:25.460" style="s2">think would be unfamiliar please stop me</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.890" end="00:04:25.460" style="s2">and we&#39;ll unpack</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:34.750" style="s2">so the difference between science and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.770" end="00:04:39.160" style="s2">epistemology writ large just to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.750" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">say it is science is an epistle of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.160" end="00:04:43.870" style="s2">science isn&#39;t epistemology it is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:45.580" style="s2">process of knowing about the objective</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.870" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">world we find ourselves in meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.580" end="00:04:50.680" style="s2">objects that can be measured and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:52.600" style="s2">where we can do repetition on</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:04:55.210" style="s2">measurement and then be able to abstract</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.600" end="00:04:57.460" style="s2">patterns from those but measurable</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.210" end="00:04:59.230" style="s2">things are third-person things right we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.460" end="00:05:00.910" style="s2">can all measure something independently</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.230" end="00:05:03.910" style="s2">get the same type of measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.910" end="00:05:05.950" style="s2">then be able to so measurable and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.910" end="00:05:07.300" style="s2">replicable science exists within the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.950" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">domain of the measurable in the replica</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.300" end="00:05:11.980" style="s2">if you imagine we have a two-by-two</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:13.570" style="s2">matrix of things that are measurable and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.980" end="00:05:15.460" style="s2">unmeasurable there are a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.570" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">that are real and are unmeasurable like</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.460" end="00:05:18.640" style="s2">an emotion you can measure a neural</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:20.170" style="s2">correlate and you can&#39;t get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.640" end="00:05:21.490" style="s2">close to actually measuring all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.170" end="00:05:23.020" style="s2">things that are happening we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">begin to understand how to do that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.020" end="00:05:27.760" style="s2">can do very rough you know qejy whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.380" style="s2">kind of stuff you can&#39;t measure in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.760" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">motion it&#39;s a first-person thing you</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.380" end="00:05:33.220" style="s2">measure third-person things you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:34.930" style="s2">measure the inside of a black hole you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.220" end="00:05:36.370" style="s2">can mathematically infer stuff you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.930" end="00:05:37.180" style="s2">measure things that are below the scale</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.370" end="00:05:38.590" style="s2">of measurability</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.180" end="00:05:39.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that are real</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.590" end="00:05:41.140" style="s2">that are unmeasurable which means</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.640" end="00:05:42.520" style="s2">they&#39;re formally outside of the domain</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.140" end="00:05:44.350" style="s2">of science but that doesn&#39;t mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.520" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">can&#39;t that any claim about them is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.350" end="00:05:52.300" style="s2">equally true right there are still</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:55.240" style="s2">methods of sense making that to be more</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.300" end="00:05:56.140" style="s2">reliable than others and then replicable</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.240" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">there are certain things that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.140" end="00:05:59.380" style="s2">measurable but not replicable because</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:02.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not a control kind of situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.380" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">where we can replicate it so formally</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.980" end="00:06:07.630" style="s2">the thing that we call science the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:10.840" style="s2">processes of science exists within one</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.630" end="00:06:12.580" style="s2">of four quadrants in which the real</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.840" end="00:06:14.050" style="s2">includes all of those so when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:20.350" style="s2">about sense making more including all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:22.270" style="s2">it and so science is necessary but not</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.350" end="00:06:24.370" style="s2">sufficient and it ends up becoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.270" end="00:06:27.730" style="s2">actually bad epistemology when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.370" end="00:06:29.980" style="s2">collapse the real to the objective right</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.730" end="00:06:33.030" style="s2">because then subject it is not real</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.980" end="00:06:35.110" style="s2">if you make real an objective synonymous</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.030" end="00:06:36.580" style="s2">subjective is also real but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.110" end="00:06:37.409" style="s2">measurable and you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.580" end="00:06:42.599" style="s2">repeatability</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.409" end="00:06:44.519" style="s2">measurable things ring and infer</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.519" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">is super useful but it also has limits</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.679" end="00:07:24.809" style="s2">and so it would be bad sense making to</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.439" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">is like kind of how you start to think</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.329" end="00:08:40.229" style="s2">about what the topics that sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">is addressing well I&#39;ll actually speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:46.529" style="s2">about confidence for a moment one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:49.769" style="s2">things oh well actually come one step</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.529" end="00:08:50.930" style="s2">back the essence if you wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.769" end="00:08:55.040" style="s2">there was an essence</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.930" end="00:08:58.550" style="s2">the essence of good sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.040" end="00:09:02.310" style="s2">earnestness in the desire to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.550" end="00:09:04.170" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and an earnestness that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.310" end="00:09:05.990" style="s2">both wants to know what is rather than</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.170" end="00:09:09.060" style="s2">wants to believe something in particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.990" end="00:09:11.430" style="s2">and an earnestness that is willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.060" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">the work that it takes to actually come</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.430" end="00:09:14.970" style="s2">to understand that rather than jump to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:16.260" style="s2">premature beliefs because that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.970" end="00:09:17.699" style="s2">comforting or allows you to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.260" end="00:09:22.199" style="s2">an in-group or seem knowledgeable or</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.699" end="00:09:24.410" style="s2">whatever else back to a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.199" end="00:09:26.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned both in ecology and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.410" end="00:09:31.160" style="s2">rapid prototyping just like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.760" end="00:09:34.620" style="s2">importance of humility and curiosity no</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.160" end="00:09:37.560" style="s2">not being attached they may be committed</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.620" end="00:09:40.380" style="s2">to something but not attached to what it</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.560" end="00:09:41.850" style="s2">may be in the case of rapid prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.380" end="00:09:44.730" style="s2">and then in the case of ecology yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.850" end="00:09:46.680" style="s2">just being humble and curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.730" end="00:09:49.470" style="s2">world around you and seeing it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.680" end="00:09:52.380" style="s2">is that kind of dynamic though right</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.470" end="00:09:53.850" style="s2">it&#39;s so curiosity and humility and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.380" end="00:09:59.160" style="s2">earnestness these words all kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.850" end="00:10:00.899" style="s2">together here right and so it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.160" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">nice definition of science Eddington</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.899" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">gave that science is the earnest</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:07.260" style="s2">endeavor to put into order the facts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:09.269" style="s2">experience so what are the facts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.260" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">experience how do we know and like what</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.269" end="00:10:12.510" style="s2">do we what am i experiencing what are</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:13.589" style="s2">others experiencing can I trust that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.510" end="00:10:15.480" style="s2">they&#39;re recording the facts of their</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.589" end="00:10:17.730" style="s2">experience you know in an adequate way</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:20.490" style="s2">and how do we put into order some kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.730" end="00:10:23.970" style="s2">of sensibility of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.490" end="00:10:27.329" style="s2">so if earnestness and like depth of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.970" end="00:10:29.610" style="s2">curiosity is the kind of essence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.329" end="00:10:33.480" style="s2">science and epistemology in general then</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.610" end="00:10:36.420" style="s2">bias would be the enemy of it and bias</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.480" end="00:10:37.860" style="s2">can come from lots of sources it can</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.420" end="00:10:39.180" style="s2">come from wanting to be part of an</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.860" end="00:10:41.190" style="s2">in-group that believes a thing so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.180" end="00:10:42.149" style="s2">where it&#39;s costly not to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.190" end="00:10:44.540" style="s2">thing because you&#39;ll be excommunicated</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.149" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">from your religion or seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.540" end="00:10:49.800" style="s2">conspiracy theorist or status quo or or</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">whatever it is that you&#39;re particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.800" end="00:10:53.310" style="s2">in group would happen to see as bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s going to create a source of bias</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.310" end="00:10:58.110" style="s2">if you want to be seen as in the know</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:00.149" style="s2">because you have particular kind of ego</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.110" end="00:11:01.980" style="s2">identifications or you want the previous</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.149" end="00:11:03.480" style="s2">thing that you did your PhD on and got</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.980" end="00:11:04.120" style="s2">famous for it to keep being right even</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.480" end="00:11:06.040" style="s2">there new stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.120" end="00:11:08.439" style="s2">that might suggest otherwise right ego</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.040" end="00:11:09.970" style="s2">stuff can obviously be a source of I</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.439" end="00:11:12.069" style="s2">want this to seem true whether it</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.970" end="00:11:13.749" style="s2">actually is true or not financial</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.069" end="00:11:15.790" style="s2">interest is probably the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.749" end="00:11:18.730" style="s2">messes science up because somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.790" end="00:11:20.740" style="s2">funding the science and typically that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">funding is coming from some existing</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.740" end="00:11:24.220" style="s2">pool of money that made the money by</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.689" style="s2">doing something that makes money that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.220" end="00:11:28.089" style="s2">going to fund stuff that makes it more</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.689" end="00:11:29.230" style="s2">money so it is not interested in things</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.089" end="00:11:30.550" style="s2">that are not going to make money it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.230" end="00:11:36.309" style="s2">interested in things that probably will</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.550" end="00:11:41.800" style="s2">and that means that either self-dealing</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.309" end="00:11:44.680" style="s2">and you know even if so it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.800" end="00:11:47.610" style="s2">possible that someone is doing science</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.680" end="00:11:49.689" style="s2">in a way where they&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.610" end="00:11:52.930" style="s2">authentically bad science because of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.689" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">financial interest they are hiding data</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:12:00.759" style="s2">someone does quote-unquote good science</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.499" end="00:12:02.439" style="s2">but that where the preponderance of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.759" end="00:12:04.300" style="s2">evidence is misleading because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.439" end="00:12:06.790" style="s2">only looking at the parts of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.300" end="00:12:08.439" style="s2">picture that have profitability so if I</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.790" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">look at pharmaceuticals for instance and</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">currently because the regulatory</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:34.779" style="s2">much money you have to look at a</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.970" end="00:12:53.949" style="s2">synthetic molecules for the most part</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.949" end="00:12:56.920" style="s2">nutrients or whatever so those things</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.569" end="00:12:58.179" style="s2">are just never gonna get the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.920" end="00:13:00.100" style="s2">of research funding so then you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.179" end="00:13:01.899" style="s2">a preponderance of evidence that says</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.100" end="00:13:03.189" style="s2">these things are more effective than</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.899" end="00:13:05.050" style="s2">these things but it was because they</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.189" end="00:13:06.939" style="s2">were and it&#39;s not even necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.050" end="00:13:08.889" style="s2">each study was bad but it&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.939" end="00:13:10.209" style="s2">not well distributed the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.889" end="00:13:15.189" style="s2">what&#39;s being studied in the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.209" end="00:13:17.019" style="s2">of reality don&#39;t match right and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.189" end="00:13:18.400" style="s2">that&#39;s another place where bias is going</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.019" end="00:13:20.110" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.400" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">be able to affect a mess-up sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.110" end="00:13:24.910" style="s2">so because of that I would say that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:26.350" style="s2">have less real science in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.910" end="00:13:29.610" style="s2">I would like to see and we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.350" end="00:13:32.050" style="s2">more of the R&amp;D arm of capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.610" end="00:13:33.580" style="s2">this becomes one of the things that for</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.410" end="00:13:50.680" style="s2">at the methodology itself these are all</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.180" end="00:13:52.960" style="s2">things that are worth factoring when</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.680" end="00:13:55.000" style="s2">trying to make sense of something I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.960" end="00:14:03.700" style="s2">gonna say something about confidence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.000" end="00:14:07.270" style="s2">certainty so it&#39;s very one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.700" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">sources of biases emotional biases do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.270" end="00:14:10.870" style="s2">talk about cognitive bias a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:12.280" style="s2">science and that there are like all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.870" end="00:14:13.530" style="s2">these logical fallacies our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.280" end="00:14:16.390" style="s2">bias but a lot of them come from</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.530" end="00:14:18.790" style="s2">emotional or identity or existential or</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.390" end="00:14:20.350" style="s2">social kind of needs we&#39;re believing</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.790" end="00:14:23.230" style="s2">something actually feels like it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.350" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">meeting some need or way for me to live</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.230" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">so I have a basis other than just</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:28.150" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s true to want to believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:32.650" style="s2">something in particular so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.150" end="00:14:33.940" style="s2">people who are seeking security conflate</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.650" end="00:14:35.260" style="s2">that the way to get security is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.940" end="00:14:38.470" style="s2">certainty about the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.260" end="00:14:40.150" style="s2">and so they will seek excessive levels</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.470" end="00:14:41.770" style="s2">of certainty with an insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.150" end="00:14:43.540" style="s2">process for gaining it because they</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.770" end="00:14:45.670" style="s2">actually have a certainty bias because</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.540" end="00:14:48.520" style="s2">they&#39;re unsafe if they don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.670" end="00:14:51.570" style="s2">right or something like that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.520" end="00:14:55.900" style="s2">example it&#39;s not exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.570" end="00:14:58.570" style="s2">so fundamentalist religion would be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.900" end="00:15:00.460" style="s2">classic example where I am utterly</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.570" end="00:15:03.490" style="s2">certain about the absolute nature of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.460" end="00:15:05.170" style="s2">reality the name of God what happens</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.490" end="00:15:08.860" style="s2">after you die and all this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.170" end="00:15:11.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s like really that whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.860" end="00:15:14.110" style="s2">only came about not that many thousands</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.620" end="00:15:15.640" style="s2">of years ago and before that the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.110" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">were just a certain about other and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.640" end="00:15:21.100" style="s2">that you know that that particular God</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:23.200" style="s2">named it every member posed and but</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.100" end="00:15:24.820" style="s2">there is the you can see in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.200" end="00:15:26.890" style="s2">the uncertainty and the unknown of death</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.820" end="00:15:29.290" style="s2">if someone is not friends with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.890" end="00:15:30.889" style="s2">unknown if they&#39;re not friends with</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.290" end="00:15:33.259" style="s2">uncertainty and they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.889" end="00:15:36.859" style="s2">then where they can&#39;t see they can</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.259" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">project scariness into that space then</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.859" end="00:15:42.230" style="s2">they want to be certain and so they want</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">to have faith even if it&#39;s not epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.230" end="00:15:48.439" style="s2">ly grounded it&#39;s actually very</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:52.489" style="s2">interesting people&#39;s fear of dark and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.439" end="00:15:54.709" style="s2">it&#39;s like why is it that I&#39;m more afraid</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.489" end="00:15:56.779" style="s2">of the exact same environment when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.709" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">just can&#39;t see it then when I could when</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.779" end="00:16:00.319" style="s2">it&#39;s the same environment with the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:02.389" style="s2">agents in it and I&#39;m not even somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.319" end="00:16:04.249" style="s2">that has nocturnal animals or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.389" end="00:16:05.660" style="s2">like what maybe sometimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.249" end="00:16:06.949" style="s2">warranted but a lot of times that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.660" end="00:16:09.230" style="s2">warranted right so where does that come</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.949" end="00:16:10.850" style="s2">from well if I can see I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.230" end="00:16:12.410" style="s2">nothing bad if I can&#39;t then my mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.850" end="00:16:14.239" style="s2">starts projecting so there people have</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.410" end="00:16:16.790" style="s2">this of dark water of deep water you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.239" end="00:16:20.089" style="s2">know where they can&#39;t see and death so</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.790" end="00:16:22.040" style="s2">and unknown in general so it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.089" end="00:16:24.499" style="s2">to have a bias towards certainty and now</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.040" end="00:16:28.579" style="s2">that can be expressed through people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.499" end="00:16:31.549" style="s2">are quote unquote using scientific ideas</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.579" end="00:16:34.129" style="s2">just as much as it can religious ones so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.549" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">there are people who are quoting science</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.129" end="00:16:37.819" style="s2">but what you can see is they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:39.559" style="s2">of science as a process of knowing they</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.819" end="00:16:41.809" style="s2">think of it as a body of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.559" end="00:16:43.309" style="s2">that there are these things called facts</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.809" end="00:16:45.079" style="s2">and that they&#39;re totally well known and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.309" end="00:16:47.179" style="s2">that those people who understand it or</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.079" end="00:16:52.489" style="s2">right and other people are not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.179" end="00:16:53.989" style="s2">wrong but stupid and and and they you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.489" end="00:16:55.489" style="s2">notice that the bias and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.989" end="00:16:57.319" style="s2">their communication is to always have</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.489" end="00:16:58.610" style="s2">pretty high certainty even it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.319" end="00:16:59.929" style="s2">even if it&#39;s just very high certainty</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.610" end="00:17:00.919" style="s2">that other people who are presenting</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.929" end="00:17:01.999" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t look like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.919" end="00:17:05.689" style="s2">science they want are certainly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.999" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">and so you&#39;re like oh they&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.689" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">same bias going and they&#39;re plugging in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:17.569" style="s2">a science set of languages rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">religious set now on the same side</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.569" end="00:17:21.589" style="s2">people can have a bias towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">uncertainty but these are still biases</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.589" end="00:17:26.409" style="s2">so this is classically what happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:28.899" style="s2">with post-modernism right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.409" end="00:17:31.100" style="s2">post-modernism said science actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.899" end="00:17:32.600" style="s2">claimed some that it shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.100" end="00:17:34.460" style="s2">claimed it actually had the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.600" end="00:17:36.200" style="s2">epistemology and a had bias going and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.460" end="00:17:42.289" style="s2">this was specifically in the social</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.200" end="00:17:43.130" style="s2">sciences where whatever Victorian white</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.289" end="00:17:45.020" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.130" end="00:17:49.040" style="s2">were looking at the racial superiority</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.020" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">of men or the white race or looking for</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.040" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">monogamous pair bonding in nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:17:55.190" style="s2">because of Victorian ideals when they</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">did geology or whatever like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.190" end="00:17:58.580" style="s2">actually a pretty significant</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:17:59.930" style="s2">confirmation bias messing up the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.580" end="00:18:01.430" style="s2">that we&#39;re calling science but being</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.930" end="00:18:05.420" style="s2">accepted scientific ideal so then they</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.430" end="00:18:07.460" style="s2">became this idea that science was just</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.420" end="00:18:09.650" style="s2">the same as all the other I&#39;m giving an</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.460" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">extreme example so forgive me obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.650" end="00:18:13.040" style="s2">Foucault and Derrida were not stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:14.360" style="s2">they didn&#39;t say this but a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.040" end="00:18:18.430" style="s2">people who don&#39;t read them all that well</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.360" end="00:18:18.430" style="s2">make this kind of generalization that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.660" end="00:18:24.290" style="s2">that there is no truth there is no</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:25.580" style="s2">absolute truth there is no way of</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">form of imperialism and because science</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.220" end="00:18:42.140" style="s2">was in spreading industrialism at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.380" end="00:18:44.330" style="s2">same time that empires were using it to</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.940" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">right because recognizing that social</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.590" end="00:19:20.360" style="s2">simple and doesn&#39;t have the same kind of</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.100" end="00:19:25.970" style="s2">badly doesn&#39;t mean that it can&#39;t be done</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:36.110" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t consider science unbiased</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.770" end="00:19:39.140" style="s2">yes but does it mean that all truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:43.040" style="s2">claims are equally valid no social</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.140" end="00:19:45.260" style="s2">science thing is the acronym weird weird</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.040" end="00:19:49.150" style="s2">populations why educated industrialized</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.260" end="00:19:52.940" style="s2">rich and democratic there&#39;s a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.150" end="00:19:55.670" style="s2">you know rightfully so narrative that a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.940" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">lot of the social scientists sciences</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.670" end="00:19:59.150" style="s2">have been stuck</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:20:00.980" style="s2">on weird populations those you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.150" end="00:20:05.780" style="s2">people who are kind of readily available</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.980" end="00:20:08.270" style="s2">in industrialized college settings so</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.780" end="00:20:10.010" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing that people have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.270" end="00:20:12.740" style="s2">pointing to more and more and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.010" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really important right now for</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.740" end="00:20:17.780" style="s2">us to kind of just point out like where</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:21.950" style="s2">where are we exhibiting different you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.780" end="00:20:24.650" style="s2">know racist or colonialist perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.950" end="00:20:26.180" style="s2">but yeah also not throwing out the baby</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.650" end="00:20:28.490" style="s2">with the bathwater and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.180" end="00:20:32.270" style="s2">differentiation you made of science</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.490" end="00:20:41.110" style="s2">being um methodology rather than like</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.270" end="00:20:43.400" style="s2">new set of truth that&#39;s already known</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.110" end="00:20:45.530" style="s2">it&#39;s really critical you know as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.400" end="00:20:47.900" style="s2">putting out the design science you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.530" end="00:20:49.960" style="s2">decade as Buckminster Fuller Institute</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.900" end="00:20:55.060" style="s2">like getting people to kind of blend and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.960" end="00:20:57.410" style="s2">Design Thinking with all that we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.060" end="00:21:00.020" style="s2">glean and understanding the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.410" end="00:21:03.380" style="s2">through science it&#39;s really helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.020" end="00:21:05.030" style="s2">have that differentiation so when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.380" end="00:21:06.740" style="s2">think about the social sciences here and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.030" end="00:21:10.610" style="s2">what we said in the beginning about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.740" end="00:21:13.370" style="s2">measurable repeatable I can measure a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.610" end="00:21:15.160" style="s2">chemical pretty well I can do different</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.370" end="00:21:17.780" style="s2">types of measurements I can use</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.160" end="00:21:20.030" style="s2">microscopy and spectrometry and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.780" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">and and then contrast that and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.030" end="00:21:27.410" style="s2">other people independently can and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:29.150" style="s2">physical properties the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.410" end="00:21:32.450" style="s2">properties of it will conform pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.150" end="00:21:35.960" style="s2">well I can&#39;t measure what someone feels</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.450" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">or really the nature and nuance and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.960" end="00:21:38.690" style="s2">complexity of what they think or the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">sense of their relationships or their</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.690" end="00:21:43.070" style="s2">motives are or whole populations or how</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.330" end="00:21:46.910" style="s2">those change I can observe certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.070" end="00:21:49.310" style="s2">things about the output behaviorally but</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.910" end="00:21:52.460" style="s2">then I have to infer a whole lot and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.310" end="00:21:55.460" style="s2">the total complexity of social science</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.460" end="00:21:57.830" style="s2">is way more complex way more variables</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.460" end="00:21:59.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s way more that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.830" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">directly measure right it is out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.990" end="00:22:06.170" style="s2">not third person it&#39;s first person and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:08.570" style="s2">second person and so that was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.170" end="00:22:09.910" style="s2">an overstepping of the idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.570" end="00:22:11.320" style="s2">would fit into the rigor</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.910" end="00:22:15.220" style="s2">domain of science and was the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.320" end="00:22:16.060" style="s2">the truth claims could be so while it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.220" end="00:22:18.750" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.060" end="00:22:20.890" style="s2">so yes it&#39;s true that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.750" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">stuff that we have excessive certainty</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.890" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">of that we shouldn&#39;t it&#39;s also true that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.720" end="00:22:27.820" style="s2">we can overcompensate and pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:32.050" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the certainty on some</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.820" end="00:22:34.780" style="s2">things that we should and that there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.050" end="00:22:36.600" style="s2">not better epistemic processes even if</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.780" end="00:22:38.890" style="s2">none are perfect for coming to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.600" end="00:22:42.850" style="s2">confidence in something so this question</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.890" end="00:22:47.880" style="s2">of what is for a particular topic in</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.850" end="00:22:53.920" style="s2">that domain what is the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.880" end="00:22:57.250" style="s2">epistemic process to come to a to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.920" end="00:22:58.930" style="s2">relative confidence why do we think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.250" end="00:23:01.180" style="s2">it&#39;s that as opposed to something else</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.930" end="00:23:02.680" style="s2">and what are the axioms that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.180" end="00:23:07.870" style="s2">drawing upon and how do those reify</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.680" end="00:23:10.030" style="s2">themselves and what is an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.870" end="00:23:11.290" style="s2">level of confidence and what is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.030" end="00:23:13.750" style="s2">appropriate process to come to that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.290" end="00:23:16.840" style="s2">level of confidence to inform certain</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.750" end="00:23:18.610" style="s2">kinds of action right those are all kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.840" end="00:23:20.650" style="s2">of important questions now I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.610" end="00:23:23.410" style="s2">getting into this a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.650" end="00:23:26.110" style="s2">formally than I thought we would and to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.410" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">get into the more probably daily</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.110" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">practical stuff we&#39;ll get there in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.360" end="00:23:34.750" style="s2">moment and it might go beyond the course</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:36.190" style="s2">of what we can do in this short time but</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.750" end="00:23:40.360" style="s2">I wanted to say a thing about certainty</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.190" end="00:23:45.010" style="s2">and uncertainty is a mature relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.360" end="00:23:46.840" style="s2">to certainty there&#39;s a rabbi friend of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.010" end="00:23:49.390" style="s2">mine that actually first told me this so</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.840" end="00:23:51.280" style="s2">it came from that background but a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.390" end="00:23:53.020" style="s2">mature relationship to certainty is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.280" end="00:23:55.480" style="s2">were comfortable having certainty where</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.020" end="00:23:58.090" style="s2">it is warranted knowing that it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.480" end="00:24:00.010" style="s2">a hundred percent but there might be 95</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.090" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">or 99 percent based on the total amount</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.010" end="00:24:03.670" style="s2">of data that we have relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.900" end="00:24:06.190" style="s2">total situation and we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.670" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">comfortable and uncertainty because if</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.190" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">like the postmodernist were we&#39;re scared</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:11.800" style="s2">of certainty or uncomfortable with it or</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:13.270" style="s2">like on the other side we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.800" end="00:24:15.220" style="s2">uncomfortable uncertainty both of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.270" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">are biases that won&#39;t actually have us</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.220" end="00:24:19.980" style="s2">just think clearly</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:22.920" style="s2">so we want to be friends with</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.980" end="00:24:25.050" style="s2">uncertainty knowing that the unknown and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.920" end="00:24:29.040" style="s2">actually the unknowable is a very large</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.050" end="00:24:31.080" style="s2">infinity and then we also want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.040" end="00:24:33.450" style="s2">endeavor earnestly to gain the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.080" end="00:24:35.400" style="s2">certainties that inform appropriate</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.400" end="00:24:38.040" style="s2">where we can actually take</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.040" end="00:24:43.500" style="s2">we care about in the world so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.120" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">want to be attached to that what I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.500" end="00:24:46.710" style="s2">is right but I do want to be attached to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.930" style="s2">understanding reality as clearly as I</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.710" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">can so that I can act as effectively in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.930" end="00:24:55.770" style="s2">service of the good so if I am working</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:57.690" style="s2">towards helping hunger and I work really</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.770" end="00:24:58.920" style="s2">diligently and earnestly and make no</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.690" end="00:25:00.930" style="s2">progress and more people are getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.920" end="00:25:05.000" style="s2">hungry I want to be able to say that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.930" end="00:25:06.750" style="s2">failing right like I it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.000" end="00:25:07.890" style="s2">important and then I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.750" end="00:25:10.470" style="s2">say I should do something different</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.890" end="00:25:12.690" style="s2">rather than continue doing that thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.470" end="00:25:14.550" style="s2">because I actually am result oriented</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.690" end="00:25:17.340" style="s2">here not just process for me I actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.550" end="00:25:20.040" style="s2">care about the people getting fed or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.340" end="00:25:22.020" style="s2">coronavirus getting solved and so I want</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.040" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">to make sure that the prompt that my</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.020" end="00:25:25.920" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s going on it</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:28.860" style="s2">informs what I think would be effective</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.920" end="00:25:31.020" style="s2">that informs the things that I try that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.860" end="00:25:33.540" style="s2">then I retest to see are they working is</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.020" end="00:25:35.010" style="s2">actually working okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.540" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">that&#39;s all very basic but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.010" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">worth ten framing up I think we can get</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.080" end="00:25:46.980" style="s2">into how does what are good tools of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:50.070" style="s2">epidemics but probably I think the place</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.980" end="00:25:52.380" style="s2">where maybe the most value can be</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.060" end="00:26:07.430" style="s2">moment as we are all trying to make</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.369" end="00:26:58.499" style="s2">absolutely relevant so there&#39;s bias</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.499" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">a bias that I notice really damaging</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.429" style="s2">coronavirus and it also damages their</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:23.700" style="s2">get into a much richer discussion of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.759" end="00:27:27.539" style="s2">there are it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to have a bias</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.330" end="00:27:47.999" style="s2"> is bad they&#39;re likely to think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.850" end="00:27:49.649" style="s2">it&#39;s probably alarmists those are</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.999" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">probably people that are catastrophizing</p>

<p begin="00:28:01.590" end="00:28:05.570" style="s2">away or to assume it&#39;s probably wrong or</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.720" end="00:28:08.279" style="s2">probably won&#39;t be the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.570" end="00:28:09.570" style="s2">whereas when evidence comes along of</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.570" end="00:28:13.109" style="s2">that bad there&#39;s an instant resonance</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.129" end="00:28:36.509" style="s2">committed to understanding what is very</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:55.260" style="s2">that kind of positivity bias is great</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.250" end="00:28:57.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not messing up our sense making</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.260" end="00:29:00.419" style="s2">it&#39;s applying our sense making in an</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.419" end="00:29:04.730" style="s2">not gonna be good at making things</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.860" end="00:29:08.100" style="s2">better if I&#39;m not seeing what is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.730" end="00:29:09.929" style="s2">so there is a you know and you think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.100" end="00:29:11.880" style="s2">it the term spiritual bypass but it can</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.929" end="00:29:16.970" style="s2">be a psychological bypass or a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.970" end="00:29:22.260" style="s2">spiritual idea or philosophic idea or</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.799" end="00:29:27.240" style="s2">bias that wants us to not be with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.260" end="00:29:29.250" style="s2">some pain right so in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.240" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">spiritual bypass whether it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.250" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">they reincarnated to have the they</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">incarnated to have those lessons or</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:39.090" style="s2">some silver lining in it or God works in</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.870" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">mysterious ways it&#39;s some way of being</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.090" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">able to say I don&#39;t have to feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:44.429" style="s2">about this thing that otherwise I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:47.059" style="s2">feel really bad about because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.429" end="00:29:51.480" style="s2">feel like I can hold that be with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.059" end="00:29:54.059" style="s2">which is kind of like a pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.480" end="00:29:55.830" style="s2">sociopathy right one of the things about</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.059" end="00:29:57.029" style="s2">sociopaths is that others can be hurting</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.830" end="00:29:59.700" style="s2">and they don&#39;t feel bad which is why</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.029" end="00:30:02.250" style="s2">they can hurt others and so any idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.700" end="00:30:05.610" style="s2">that makes us able to not feel bad in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.250" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">the pray in the presence of others</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.610" end="00:30:10.049" style="s2">feeling bad is taking beliefs that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:15.330" style="s2">moving us in the direction of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.049" end="00:30:17.880" style="s2">sociopathy like set of behaviors so when</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.330" end="00:30:20.250" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing people who are gasping for</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.880" end="00:30:21.630" style="s2">air and dying in that way and their</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.250" end="00:30:23.220" style="s2">family members can&#39;t even be with them</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.630" end="00:30:26.850" style="s2">on their deathbed because they would get</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.220" end="00:30:28.350" style="s2">sick upset about it right and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.850" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">unnecessary and it could have prevented</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.350" end="00:30:36.600" style="s2">that I&#39;m super sad for them and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.059" end="00:30:46.700" style="s2">better job and I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.240" end="00:30:48.779" style="s2">to feel any other way</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.700" end="00:30:50.610" style="s2">like there would be something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.779" end="00:30:53.549" style="s2">me if I didn&#39;t feel those feelings it</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.610" end="00:30:56.309" style="s2">would mean that I like I had to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.549" end="00:30:57.750" style="s2">fractured inside I&#39;m speaking to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.309" end="00:30:59.850" style="s2">because I see this ramp</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.750" end="00:31:01.080" style="s2">plea with people latching on to oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.850" end="00:31:02.580" style="s2">there&#39;s this new drug it looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.080" end="00:31:04.110" style="s2">gonna work before there&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.580" end="00:31:05.610" style="s2">sense making that we know enough about</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.110" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2">the drug because they really want</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.610" end="00:31:09.390" style="s2">something that&#39;s gonna work oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:10.950" style="s2">this great new diagnostic test oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.390" end="00:31:13.230" style="s2">there&#39;s this one epidemiologist has said</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.950" end="00:31:14.610" style="s2">it&#39;s really not that bad oh look there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.230" end="00:31:16.550" style="s2">this thing that shows empty hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.610" end="00:31:18.840" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s really not that bad and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.550" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">they&#39;ll latch on to that before</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.840" end="00:31:23.070" style="s2">really studying it but reject the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:26.130" style="s2">which means that they won&#39;t be part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.070" end="00:31:28.380" style="s2">making things better so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.130" end="00:31:29.880" style="s2">common bias and of course it goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.380" end="00:31:32.520" style="s2">without saying the exact opposite bias</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.880" end="00:31:35.820" style="s2">is also common which is a catastrophism</p>

<p begin="00:31:39.670" end="00:31:43.750" style="s2">could be that something isn&#39;t that bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.950" end="00:31:45.580" style="s2">or there might be a solution someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.750" end="00:31:47.230" style="s2">tends to think that it is probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.580" end="00:31:49.390" style="s2">fail and when they see anything that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.230" end="00:31:52.890" style="s2">looks like a possible risk they assume</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.240" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">supply yes does that mean that the food</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.340" end="00:32:30.490" style="s2">supply is already so messed up that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">inexorable that two billion people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.490" end="00:32:34.210" style="s2">going to starve no we can still totally</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:35.410" style="s2">do stuff about it but there are some</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.210" end="00:32:36.730" style="s2">people who I&#39;ve talked with over the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.410" end="00:32:38.830" style="s2">last couple days who&#39;ve called me</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.730" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">freaking out saying did you see like</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.830" end="00:32:43.210" style="s2">their locusts in northern Africa and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.680" style="s2">Middle East and crops rotting in India</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.210" end="00:32:46.330" style="s2">we&#39;re losing the food supply everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.680" end="00:32:47.710" style="s2">gonna starve well it&#39;s true there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.330" end="00:32:49.720" style="s2">locusts in northern Africa in the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.710" end="00:32:52.060" style="s2">East and it&#39;s a big deal and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.720" end="00:32:53.230" style="s2">crops are rotting in India it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.060" end="00:32:56.770" style="s2">that two billion people are gonna starve</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.230" end="00:32:58.630" style="s2">it is true that they could and but</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.770" end="00:33:00.940" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is that possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.630" end="00:33:03.010" style="s2">typically we want to do worst-case</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.940" end="00:33:05.260" style="s2">scenario forecasting so we can prevent</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.010" end="00:33:06.910" style="s2">it because if you don&#39;t know that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.260" end="00:33:08.500" style="s2">could happen then you don&#39;t see what the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.910" end="00:33:11.590" style="s2">escalation pathways are then you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.500" end="00:33:13.060" style="s2">prevent it and but then if we prevent it</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.590" end="00:33:15.220" style="s2">the people with the positivity bias will</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.060" end="00:33:16.660" style="s2">say see you were just catastrophists for</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.220" end="00:33:18.250" style="s2">doing that nothing bad really ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.660" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">happens all that bad ever happen it</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.250" end="00:33:21.130" style="s2">would have happened had we not done</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.630" style="s2">these things it only didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.130" end="00:33:24.160" style="s2">because we did the worst case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.630" end="00:33:27.550" style="s2">planning and saw what it took to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.160" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">it so I want to do worst-case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.550" end="00:33:30.670" style="s2">but know that it&#39;s a scenario it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s already happened and then I</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.670" end="00:33:33.370" style="s2">want to see how to prevent it so I want</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:37.170" style="s2">the positivity to be oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.370" end="00:33:39.550" style="s2">action not towards sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.170" end="00:33:41.230" style="s2">so does this make sense on positivity</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.550" end="00:33:43.960" style="s2">negativity bias and how they mess up are</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.230" end="00:33:47.260" style="s2">sense-making especially where there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.960" end="00:33:50.140" style="s2">high consequence high pain topics yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.260" end="00:33:53.010" style="s2">yeah and it seems like there&#39;s just kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.140" end="00:33:53.010" style="s2">of this through line</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.180" end="00:33:59.910" style="s2">kind of like the ego getting in the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.470" end="00:34:01.590" style="s2">like people want to have the bias toward</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.910" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">certainty but a bias towards certainty</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.590" end="00:34:05.370" style="s2">kind of shows up in this way to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:08.450" style="s2">intermingle with the positivity in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.370" end="00:34:09.990" style="s2">catastrophic bias of just people</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.450" end="00:34:11.639" style="s2">especially right now because</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.990" end="00:34:13.560" style="s2">everything&#39;s so up in the air people</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.639" end="00:34:16.590" style="s2">just want to have some grinding you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.560" end="00:34:19.500" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve seen in myself and in others</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.590" end="00:34:21.419" style="s2">the just biased towards okay I want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.500" end="00:34:24.360" style="s2">make sense of this I want to know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.419" end="00:34:28.350" style="s2">know what&#39;s happening in what order with</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.360" end="00:34:29.790" style="s2">what timeframe and I think something</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.350" end="00:34:31.620" style="s2">that we&#39;ve seen again in a through-line</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.790" end="00:34:33.990" style="s2">through a lot of what we&#39;re learning is</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.620" end="00:34:35.879" style="s2">just like the world is dynamic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.990" end="00:34:39.360" style="s2">always shifting change is the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.879" end="00:34:41.510" style="s2">constant and so how can we kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.360" end="00:34:44.310" style="s2">more comfortable with not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.510" end="00:34:49.560" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s gonna happen but be in</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.310" end="00:34:52.409" style="s2">that state of mystical widening our view</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.560" end="00:34:54.990" style="s2">is still having like facing that with</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.409" end="00:34:58.830" style="s2">like a deeper hunger for knowing as much</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.990" end="00:35:00.570" style="s2">as we can yes and the deeper hunger that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.830" end="00:35:02.040" style="s2">is not a hunger that jumps to false</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.570" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">conclusions because we want them there</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.040" end="00:35:07.980" style="s2">but it does the hard work that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:09.930" style="s2">to actually endeavor towards so you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.980" end="00:35:11.070" style="s2">I really want to know what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.930" end="00:35:12.990" style="s2">saying right I really want to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.070" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen what could happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.990" end="00:35:16.170" style="s2">what the right order of operation should</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">be how we should tend to think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.170" end="00:35:21.060" style="s2">I&#39;m working on knowing that stuff but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:23.190" style="s2">don&#39;t think that I can scroll my</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.060" end="00:35:25.340" style="s2">facebook feed and read for several hours</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.190" end="00:35:29.640" style="s2">and have a good sense of those things</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.340" end="00:35:32.520" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like I want to be buff and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.640" end="00:35:33.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to workout that hard like</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.520" end="00:35:35.700" style="s2">it&#39;s just not gonna work right this so</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.960" end="00:35:37.740" style="s2">there is an input output equation that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.700" end="00:35:39.480" style="s2">has to happen and like being buff or</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.740" end="00:35:41.130" style="s2">being able to play the piano like being</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.480" end="00:35:45.990" style="s2">able to make sense of a topic takes the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.130" end="00:35:49.320" style="s2">work that it takes and so now this</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.990" end="00:35:50.730" style="s2">brings us to the next bias well I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.320" end="00:35:53.010" style="s2">do that much work because I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.730" end="00:35:56.520" style="s2">expert in virology or in epidemiology or</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.010" end="00:36:02.570" style="s2">in immunology or a industrial sanitation</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.520" end="00:36:05.250" style="s2">engineer or in diagnostic medicine or in</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.250" end="00:36:10.770" style="s2">for contact tracing or in macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.220" end="00:36:11.790" style="s2">or in domestic politics security or in</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.770" end="00:36:14.040" style="s2">the nature of what&#39;s happening with</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.040" end="00:36:17.250" style="s2">chains of food how the could I</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.630" end="00:36:19.530" style="s2">possibly know that but there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.250" end="00:36:20.700" style="s2">authorities that know this so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.530" end="00:36:23.310" style="s2">to defer to the authorities I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.700" end="00:36:24.900" style="s2">cognitively offload that complexity now</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.310" end="00:36:27.000" style="s2">there is a bias in terms of how people</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.900" end="00:36:30.600" style="s2">relate to Authority that&#39;s important and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.000" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s similarly I&#39;m oversimplifying has a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.600" end="00:36:35.700" style="s2">bias um two directions both of which are</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:38.190" style="s2">bias which means not clear which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.700" end="00:36:39.780" style="s2">there are people that tend to think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.190" end="00:36:41.580" style="s2">most of the people who are in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.780" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">primary authorized positions are</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.580" end="00:36:46.950" style="s2">probably trustworthy which would be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:47.870" style="s2">silly thing to think and other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.950" end="00:36:50.190" style="s2">who assume that they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.870" end="00:36:52.140" style="s2">untrustworthy and corrupt which is also</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.190" end="00:36:54.210" style="s2">a silly thing to think and those are</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.140" end="00:36:55.770" style="s2">very kind of sweeping generalizations</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:57.210" style="s2">that keep us from actually doing sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.770" end="00:36:58.620" style="s2">making because we&#39;re not looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.210" end="00:36:59.880" style="s2">are they actually saying what is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.620" end="00:37:02.700" style="s2">track record of where they&#39;ve been right</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.880" end="00:37:04.110" style="s2">and wrong on this topic so far and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.700" end="00:37:06.330" style="s2">historically and where is there a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.110" end="00:37:08.820" style="s2">divergence or a convergence of opinions</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.330" end="00:37:10.140" style="s2">of people and am i biasing towards some</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.820" end="00:37:11.640" style="s2">of them because of political association</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.140" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">or because of positivity and negativity</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.640" end="00:37:17.700" style="s2">bias or things like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:19.800" style="s2">so can I find virologists that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.700" end="00:37:21.870" style="s2">saying oh this is not mutating in a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.800" end="00:37:23.190" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna have a worse train yes can</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.870" end="00:37:24.360" style="s2">I find other ones that are saying oh the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.190" end="00:37:28.080" style="s2">next train is probably gonna be many</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.360" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">times worse yes who are experts so how</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.080" end="00:37:31.500" style="s2">do I possibly make sense of this if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:33.300" style="s2">not a PhD virologist and there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.500" end="00:37:38.940" style="s2">eminent ones who disagree you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.300" end="00:37:42.390" style="s2">pretty intensively and on every topic we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.940" end="00:37:44.040" style="s2">can say something like that right well</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.390" end="00:37:49.230" style="s2">you actually can this is the nice thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.040" end="00:37:51.630" style="s2">is that the the you have the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.230" end="00:37:53.790" style="s2">being able to look at where experts are</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.630" end="00:37:56.040" style="s2">converging where they&#39;re also diverging</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.790" end="00:37:59.580" style="s2">and what the basis of the divergence is</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.040" end="00:38:01.110" style="s2">and possibly having less biased in them</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.580" end="00:38:02.520" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t get a Nobel Prize</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.110" end="00:38:04.080" style="s2">saying this thing where you have an ego</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.520" end="00:38:05.640" style="s2">invested in defending this particular</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.080" end="00:38:07.050" style="s2">thing and you don&#39;t have research grants</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.640" end="00:38:09.060" style="s2">that need to believe in this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.050" end="00:38:11.070" style="s2">you haven&#39;t had all of your attention in</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.060" end="00:38:12.660" style="s2">this one part of the picture where this</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.070" end="00:38:14.010" style="s2">virologist is looking at this this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.660" end="00:38:15.870" style="s2">looking at this was looking at this you</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:38.080" style="s2">look at the activities of Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.650" end="00:44:40.339" style="s2">Communist Party there&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.080" end="00:44:41.950" style="s2">global agendas it would be silly to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.339" end="00:44:44.869" style="s2">think otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.950" end="00:44:47.210" style="s2">and he wasn&#39;t right out of nowhere he</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.869" end="00:44:49.310" style="s2">was right because Bannon and others</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.210" end="00:44:52.609" style="s2">happened to give him insight there and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.310" end="00:44:55.220" style="s2">it happened to resonate with that as</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.609" end="00:44:57.500" style="s2">just kind of a dealmaker kind of guy</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.220" end="00:45:00.170" style="s2">when he sat across from them he probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.500" end="00:45:02.060" style="s2">had the sense of like oh it feels</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.170" end="00:45:05.359" style="s2">like these guys are playing some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.060" end="00:45:07.700" style="s2">serious game that I some some go game</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.359" end="00:45:09.230" style="s2">that I don&#39;t feel well set up for now</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.700" end="00:45:13.040" style="s2">he&#39;s been wrong about a gazillion things</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.230" end="00:45:14.450" style="s2">and so again wanting to over norm that</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.040" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">he&#39;s wrong and stupid and evil about</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.450" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">everything or right and the savior on</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:21.140" style="s2">everything is not thinking now of course</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:22.490" style="s2">it&#39;s fine if I&#39;m trying to sense make</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.140" end="00:45:24.770" style="s2">there might be some people who are right</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.490" end="00:45:26.869" style="s2">often enough that I look to them as</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:28.670" style="s2">sources of higher signal lower noise up</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.869" end="00:45:29.780" style="s2">front but I still check and there might</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.670" end="00:45:31.130" style="s2">be other people that even though they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.780" end="00:45:33.020" style="s2">been right a couple times I assume it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.130" end="00:45:36.440" style="s2">probably low signal enough that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.020" end="00:45:39.470" style="s2">generally don&#39;t check I can&#39;t generalize</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.440" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">on that in consequential areas so</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.470" end="00:45:44.420" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine I&#39;m gonna use this</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:46.940" style="s2">because this is a very good example of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.420" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">where sense-making is tricky where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.940" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">consequential</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.980" end="00:45:57.559" style="s2">so hydroxychloroquine is a anti-malarial</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.849" end="00:45:59.390" style="s2">primarily but it also has antiviral</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.559" end="00:46:02.539" style="s2">properties has been used as an antiviral</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.390" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">and is used in rheumatology heavily for</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.539" end="00:46:06.529" style="s2">rheumatic conditions it&#39;s a drug that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">been used for many decades very heavily</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.529" end="00:46:11.749" style="s2">since Vietnam the United States military</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:14.690" style="s2">has put most US soldiers on it before</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.749" end="00:46:17.960" style="s2">they deploy to areas that have malaria</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.690" end="00:46:20.569" style="s2">as a malarial prophylaxis so before they</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.960" end="00:46:20.900" style="s2">go to for the first four years know</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.569" end="00:46:23.480" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.900" end="00:46:30.950" style="s2">they lived in Ivory Coast yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.480" end="00:46:33.619" style="s2">and so we have a pretty enormous amount</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.950" end="00:46:34.869" style="s2">of data on the long-term effects and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.619" end="00:46:37.460" style="s2">safety and the whatever of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.869" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine is it a totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.460" end="00:46:42.769" style="s2">benign drug no it&#39;s not vitamin C it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:45.099" style="s2">absolutely affect hearts this thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.769" end="00:46:47.059" style="s2">called the QT interval it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.099" end="00:46:49.579" style="s2">contraindicated with some meds and some</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.059" end="00:46:51.109" style="s2">conditions but do we at least understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.579" end="00:46:53.569" style="s2">the contraindications in the general</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.109" end="00:46:55.130" style="s2">safety profile well especially as a old</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.569" end="00:46:56.569" style="s2">generic drug that has been around</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.130" end="00:46:58.130" style="s2">forever and men in combination with all</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.569" end="00:46:59.960" style="s2">the other drugs and has a generally</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.130" end="00:47:04.190" style="s2">pretty good safety profile relative to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.960" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">advanced coveted pictures yes do we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.190" end="00:47:08.089" style="s2">randomized control trials that show that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s effective placebo can you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.089" end="00:47:12.589" style="s2">double-blind placebo-controlled</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:14.989" style="s2">multi-location type thing no</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.589" end="00:47:16.279" style="s2">slow those take a long time to do now</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.989" end="00:47:18.619" style="s2">those are awesome like randomized</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.279" end="00:47:21.289" style="s2">control trials are totally a good sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.619" end="00:47:22.579" style="s2">making tool in epistemic tool but there</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.289" end="00:47:24.950" style="s2">are a bunch of people who have been</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.579" end="00:47:27.619" style="s2">taught that it is the only tool that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.950" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">exists to make sense of pharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.619" end="00:47:31.099" style="s2">which is that or nonsense that means</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:32.509" style="s2">that those people are not actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.099" end="00:47:34.700" style="s2">making good sense of the world or</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.509" end="00:47:39.289" style="s2">thinking they are they&#39;ve been drilled</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.700" end="00:47:40.519" style="s2">in this kind of over norming on one tool</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.289" end="00:47:42.619" style="s2">because it happens to be a lovely tool</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.519" end="00:47:44.509" style="s2">when we can do it and it also happens to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.619" end="00:47:46.670" style="s2">be the one that the FDA wants and so it</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.509" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">also happens to be the one that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.670" end="00:47:49.730" style="s2">better take if you want a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:51.460" style="s2">maximum-security position to have your</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.730" end="00:47:54.349" style="s2">malpractice not get you in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.460" end="00:47:55.999" style="s2">so this is another source of bias on it</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.349" end="00:48:01.220" style="s2">right what is the maximally defensible</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.999" end="00:48:03.390" style="s2">position is also a major thing okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.220" end="00:48:06.090" style="s2">by the time the randomized control</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.390" end="00:48:07.590" style="s2">trials are done heaps of people will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.090" end="00:48:09.830" style="s2">dead and I see yous will be overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.590" end="00:48:11.690" style="s2">in case fatality rate will have spiked</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.830" end="00:48:14.369" style="s2">precipitously</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.690" end="00:48:15.510" style="s2">so should we give people drugs that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.369" end="00:48:18.210" style="s2">might be more dangerous and not</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.510" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">effective just based on pendulum dowsing</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.210" end="00:48:24.690" style="s2">no but are there ways of making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">something to enough degree to effect</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.690" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">some kind of action yes so with regard</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:35.130" style="s2">to hydroxychloroquine I&#39;ll use this as</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:37.560" style="s2">an example there were randomized control</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.130" end="00:48:41.220" style="s2">trials for it and SARS SARS cough one</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.560" end="00:48:44.670" style="s2">right that&#39;s meaningful it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.220" end="00:48:48.390" style="s2">virus this a novel virus but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.670" end="00:48:50.520" style="s2">lot of similarities and mechanisms there</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.390" end="00:48:52.320" style="s2">were randomized control trials for it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.520" end="00:48:56.369" style="s2">and other viruses including other corona</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.320" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">viruses there have been in vitro trials</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.369" end="00:49:00.150" style="s2">on that are very effective on this one</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:04.650" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry too</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.150" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">and there are a lot of non randomized</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.650" end="00:49:09.030" style="s2">control trials but open label trials</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:11.099" style="s2">ones in China ones in South Korea ones</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.030" end="00:49:14.060" style="s2">in France the one in New York but then</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.099" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">heaps of doctors that are using it that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.060" end="00:49:19.530" style="s2">are not nothing right they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:22.330" style="s2">people controlled but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.530" end="00:49:24.100" style="s2">nothing now</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.330" end="00:49:26.590" style="s2">there are some things that just placebos</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.100" end="00:49:29.010" style="s2">don&#39;t really affect right placebos don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.590" end="00:49:31.840" style="s2">do a good job of healing broken bones</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.010" end="00:49:33.310" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t need placebo controls</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.840" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">for things that don&#39;t really produce</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.310" end="00:49:38.620" style="s2">placebo effects and so placebos don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:39.910" style="s2">kill viruses now do placebos with</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.620" end="00:49:43.120" style="s2">modulate your immune system to some</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.910" end="00:49:45.340" style="s2">degree sure right but is there an amount</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.120" end="00:49:47.170" style="s2">of effectiveness that placebos have on</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.340" end="00:49:49.330" style="s2">viral conditions statistically so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.170" end="00:49:51.270" style="s2">can remove that statistical artifact and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.330" end="00:49:53.220" style="s2">then be able to still look at is there</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.270" end="00:49:55.540" style="s2">effect beyond the sisters just</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.220" end="00:49:57.490" style="s2">statistical artifact so that psycho way</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.540" end="00:49:59.010" style="s2">of saying hey we can actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.490" end="00:50:01.540" style="s2">make sense of this here</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.010" end="00:50:02.560" style="s2">factoring placebo considerations even if</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.540" end="00:50:08.260" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing the placebo control</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.560" end="00:50:12.670" style="s2">trial so we brought a group of doctors</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.260" end="00:50:14.260" style="s2">together group of MDS to work on doing a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.670" end="00:50:16.630" style="s2">literature review of hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.260" end="00:50:18.370" style="s2">and by itself and in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.630" end="00:50:19.570" style="s2">zinc and as if through myosin and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.370" end="00:50:23.020" style="s2">doxycycline and other things like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.570" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">and we looked at the mechanistic trials</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.020" end="00:50:26.290" style="s2">in vitro trials the animal trials the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:27.340" style="s2">current home and ylabel trials previous</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.290" end="00:50:29.100" style="s2">ones and we were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.340" end="00:50:32.890" style="s2">preponderance of data and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.100" end="00:50:35.500" style="s2">relative benefit to risk in different</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.970" end="00:50:41.410" style="s2">data factoring the consequence of action</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.070" end="00:50:43.210" style="s2">and inaction now I don&#39;t get malpractice</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.410" end="00:50:44.530" style="s2">lawsuits for inaction in the same way I</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.210" end="00:50:46.600" style="s2">get them for action so that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.530" end="00:50:48.670" style="s2">being a source of bias and the cya you</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.600" end="00:50:50.170" style="s2">know cover your ass kind of way that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.670" end="00:50:53.050" style="s2">different than just trying to sense make</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.170" end="00:50:55.120" style="s2">how do I save the most lives and so I</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.759" end="00:51:59.410" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a good emergency</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.690" end="00:52:09.249" style="s2">now again with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.829" end="00:52:11.619" style="s2">hydroxychloroquine there&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.249" end="00:52:16.029" style="s2">evidence that in late stage infection it</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.619" end="00:52:17.949" style="s2">doesn&#39;t help very much but there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.029" end="00:52:20.859" style="s2">very few antivirals that help in late</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.949" end="00:52:24.640" style="s2">stage infection in the entire corpus of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.859" end="00:52:27.130" style="s2">medicine and the general rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.640" end="00:52:28.959" style="s2">with infection as a whole is treat early</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.130" end="00:52:30.579" style="s2">rather than late because once it gets</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.959" end="00:52:32.410" style="s2">bad it&#39;s much much harder but especially</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.579" end="00:52:33.999" style="s2">with viruses is that only in the very</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.410" end="00:52:38.140" style="s2">beginning do you have meaningful chance</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.999" end="00:52:40.839" style="s2">so a lot of people know if you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.140" end="00:52:42.519" style="s2">shingles or if you get herpes acyclovir</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.839" end="00:52:45.130" style="s2">can help if you get to it within 24</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.519" end="00:52:46.809" style="s2">hours at most 48 hours after that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.130" end="00:52:51.069" style="s2">do almost nothing in that time it does a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.809" end="00:52:52.660" style="s2">lot if you&#39;re in late stage aids the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.069" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">cocktail the antiviral cocktail doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.660" end="00:52:55.209" style="s2">help that much if you&#39;re in very early</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:58.479" style="s2">stage it will prevent disease</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.209" end="00:53:02.259" style="s2">progression so if you do a randomized</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.479" end="00:53:05.109" style="s2">control trial for hydroxychloroquine or</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.259" end="00:53:08.799" style="s2">even the open label trials or FDA</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.109" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">provisional emergency approval for late</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.799" end="00:53:13.719" style="s2">stage as an antiviral when pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:15.130" style="s2">no antivirals work late stage and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.719" end="00:53:17.289" style="s2">you assume what that means about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.130" end="00:53:19.180" style="s2">drug writ large in factoring for early</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.289" end="00:53:20.920" style="s2">stage that would just be silly that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.180" end="00:53:22.180" style="s2">would be going against the preponderance</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.920" end="00:53:25.140" style="s2">of knowledge we have about viral</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.180" end="00:53:27.459" style="s2">mechanisms and antivirals writ large</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.140" end="00:53:29.979" style="s2">so the randomized control trial should</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.459" end="00:53:31.900" style="s2">be for early stage right which is kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.979" end="00:53:33.930" style="s2">of akin to like how we&#39;ve been testing</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.900" end="00:53:35.709" style="s2">people we&#39;ve only been testing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.930" end="00:53:37.779" style="s2">predominant you have been testing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.709" end="00:53:39.549" style="s2">very sick rather than a random sampling</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.779" end="00:53:43.299" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t really have a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.549" end="00:53:46.269" style="s2">of where the denominator is correct so</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.299" end="00:53:48.339" style="s2">we do need background random testing for</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.269" end="00:53:49.240" style="s2">epidemiological forecasting and being</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.339" end="00:53:51.730" style="s2">able to think</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.240" end="00:53:53.410" style="s2">out herd immunity and inoculating with</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.730" end="00:53:56.110" style="s2">less virulent forms of the virus and</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.410" end="00:53:57.810" style="s2">other things with them but sand on this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.110" end="00:54:00.610" style="s2">one for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.810" end="00:54:03.010" style="s2">so one should we wait for randomized</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.610" end="00:54:04.420" style="s2">control trials to be able to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.010" end="00:54:05.950" style="s2">of something no we should look at the</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.340" end="00:54:19.450" style="s2">we have to the scenario and know that</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.450" end="00:54:22.330" style="s2">all the time in the world is different</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:24.550" style="s2">than the sense-making we would do when</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.330" end="00:54:25.840" style="s2">there is consequence to inaction which</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.550" end="00:54:26.950" style="s2">is why I said we have to have the right</p>

<p begin="00:54:37.750" end="00:54:42.300" style="s2">knowledge of course should we be doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.790" end="00:54:45.580" style="s2">them late stage only well if we want</p>

<p begin="00:54:50.380" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">information warfare tactic to prove that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.140" end="00:54:59.080" style="s2">Trump was wrong in an idiot or to make a</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.080" end="00:55:02.440" style="s2">that nobody can make much money on seem</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:04.660" style="s2">and effective so some patented drug can</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.440" end="00:55:07.180" style="s2">make a lot of money or whatever if I</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.660" end="00:55:08.770" style="s2">wanted to do that I would set up a late</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.180" end="00:55:10.270" style="s2">stage trial that showed that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.770" end="00:55:12.490" style="s2">effective and then over generalize those</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.270" end="00:55:14.200" style="s2">results across the board now it also set</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.490" end="00:55:15.550" style="s2">up a late stage trial where the placebo</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.200" end="00:55:17.140" style="s2">is vitamin C which one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.550" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">studies is doing right now where vitamin</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.140" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">C is widely known to be an effective</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.990" style="s2">antiviral and then I get plausible</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:24.130" style="s2">deniability that I&#39;m doing good science</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.990" end="00:55:25.690" style="s2">because it comes from a prestigious</p>

<p begin="00:55:27.750" end="00:55:35.109" style="s2">so now we start to get into I struggled</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.550" end="00:55:38.410" style="s2">through watching this David Icke thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.109" end="00:55:40.570" style="s2">the other day it was very painful there</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.410" end="00:55:42.060" style="s2">was extraordinarily little signal in it</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.690" end="00:55:56.920" style="s2">so Hong Kong had almost nobody died</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:58.270" style="s2">because of good response and South Korea</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.920" end="00:56:02.609" style="s2">didn&#39;t respond quite as quickly but they</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.270" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">responded well and still very few deaths</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.609" end="00:56:07.240" style="s2">okay well they&#39;re littler places Islands</p>

<p begin="01:00:51.410" end="01:00:59.220" style="s2">awesome they ought to screw drivers and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.829" end="01:01:00.420" style="s2">they suck for welding so if someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.220" end="01:01:01.470" style="s2">actually wants to be able to fix a car</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.420" end="01:01:02.700" style="s2">you got to have a lot of tools know how</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.470" end="01:01:05.640" style="s2">to use them and know which one to use</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.700" end="01:01:06.930" style="s2">for which situation and if someone wants</p>

<p begin="01:01:06.930" end="01:01:10.710" style="s2">and if that seems like too much then you</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.300" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">should just accept the idea you probably</p>

<p begin="01:01:21.120" end="01:01:26.790" style="s2">it helped I mean it brings up people&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:01:55.440" end="01:02:00.750" style="s2">that a super complex but I will draw a</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.710" end="01:02:04.860" style="s2">parallel that has at least some truth</p>

<p begin="01:02:08.250" end="01:02:13.230" style="s2">somewhat in the bias they have towards</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.750" end="01:02:15.060" style="s2">authorities later their parents and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.230" end="01:02:18.150" style="s2">teachers and whatever other authorities</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.060" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">from childhood so the people that did</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.150" end="01:02:21.960" style="s2">better in school and did better with</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:25.080" style="s2">their parents and kind of did well with</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.960" end="01:02:27.270" style="s2">the standard model more often than the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.080" end="01:02:29.400" style="s2">other crew will tend to think that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.270" end="01:02:31.170" style="s2">standard model is well and think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.400" end="01:02:33.840" style="s2">the current authorities are probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.170" end="01:02:36.890" style="s2">trustworthy and good and the people that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.840" end="01:02:39.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t do well at those things and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.890" end="01:02:41.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t have trust where the authorities</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.090" end="01:02:43.410" style="s2">are more likely to have that generalized</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.160" end="01:02:44.940" style="s2">sense right that&#39;s not an absolute it</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.410" end="01:02:46.950" style="s2">can come from lots of other things later</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.940" end="01:02:48.390" style="s2">life events but those are interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.950" end="01:02:50.310" style="s2">things to look at and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.390" end="01:02:51.690" style="s2">interesting where it&#39;s like I want</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.170" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">hijack our adult brain being able to</p>

<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">they can prey upon that mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.360" end="01:03:26.700" style="s2">yeah I think one of the root causes of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:28.050" style="s2">so many of our are interdependent crisis</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.700" end="01:03:30.660" style="s2">right now is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.050" end="01:03:33.570" style="s2">avoidance of that inner work avoidance</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.660" end="01:03:37.590" style="s2">of that being even okay to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.570" end="01:03:39.330" style="s2">those things you know and seems like</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.590" end="01:03:41.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a trend towards you know being</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.330" end="01:03:46.170" style="s2">okay with therapy or coaching as kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.640" end="01:03:52.619" style="s2">like a therapy like tool what people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.170" end="01:03:56.490" style="s2">becoming more yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.619" end="01:03:58.200" style="s2">stigmatized than it once was but people</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.490" end="01:03:59.790" style="s2">realize that their effective choice</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.200" end="01:04:01.380" style="s2">making and requires effective</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.790" end="01:04:02.970" style="s2">understanding about both the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.380" end="01:04:04.740" style="s2">the world and what the affect of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.970" end="01:04:07.200" style="s2">particular choice or injunction is going</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.740" end="01:04:09.990" style="s2">to be then a sentence made clearly</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.200" end="01:04:11.310" style="s2">becomes a very high goal and once they</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.990" end="01:04:13.290" style="s2">realize that a lot of the bad sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.310" end="01:04:15.090" style="s2">making comes from psychological</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.290" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">predispositions biases that come from</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.090" end="01:04:22.610" style="s2">those places then psychological work</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:25.500" style="s2">actually becomes part of sense making</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.610" end="01:04:27.960" style="s2">so do you know as much as I might want</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.500" end="01:04:30.270" style="s2">to learn math or statistics or Bayesian</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.960" end="01:04:32.670" style="s2">analysis I might also want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.270" end="01:04:34.740" style="s2">do bias assessment and be able to see</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.670" end="01:04:40.260" style="s2">where those biases arise from and clear</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.740" end="01:04:46.050" style="s2">them yeah so this moment that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.260" end="01:04:47.850" style="s2">is an opening for a healing at a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.050" end="01:04:50.030" style="s2">different levels and one of those is</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.850" end="01:04:52.020" style="s2">finding as people are in stress</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.030" end="01:04:56.850" style="s2">situations some of their kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.020" end="01:04:58.830" style="s2">unaddressed trauma is arising and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.850" end="01:05:02.720" style="s2">think similarly kind of like our</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.830" end="01:05:05.130" style="s2">unaddressed root causes of you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.720" end="01:05:08.300" style="s2">what&#39;s creating the ecological crisis</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.130" end="01:05:10.650" style="s2">and and climate change and everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.300" end="01:05:12.390" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s an opening right now for us</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.650" end="01:05:15.210" style="s2">to see right like the the true meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.390" end="01:05:16.920" style="s2">of apocalypse is an unveiling of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.210" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">greater truth that was and that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.920" end="01:05:22.410" style="s2">unfair --nt before that moment happened</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:25.140" style="s2">so yeah curious to hear what you think</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.410" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">of and all of that insights making and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.140" end="01:05:33.450" style="s2">in this moment I&#39;m gonna share something</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:38.630" style="s2">that I have to share a dialectic of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.450" end="01:05:41.310" style="s2">things for it to make sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.630" end="01:05:43.380" style="s2">so where people notice that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.310" end="01:05:45.630" style="s2">psychological process that seems more</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.380" end="01:05:47.610" style="s2">like a child than an adult psychological</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.630" end="01:05:49.320" style="s2">process I want to be reassured I want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.610" end="01:05:51.000" style="s2">be comforted I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.320" end="01:05:52.290" style="s2">on I want to know that an authority is</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.000" end="01:05:54.530" style="s2">taking care of it or can tell me what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.290" end="01:05:54.530" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.069" end="01:06:02.900" style="s2">anything that they do from there will</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.449" end="01:06:02.900" style="s2">not help</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.280" end="01:06:07.480" style="s2">if they&#39;re trying to act on the world if</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.990" end="01:06:09.890" style="s2">they&#39;re sharing information or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.480" end="01:06:13.520" style="s2">so the only thing they can do from there</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.890" end="01:06:16.220" style="s2">is actually respond to the site address</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.520" end="01:06:17.780" style="s2">their own psychology until they come to</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.220" end="01:06:19.340" style="s2">a more empowered place and then from a</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.780" end="01:06:21.110" style="s2">more empowered place try to sense make</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.340" end="01:06:27.710" style="s2">the world and then act from clear sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.110" end="01:06:30.920" style="s2">making don&#39;t act from those places so I</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.710" end="01:06:34.810" style="s2">really want to see people showing up in</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.920" end="01:06:34.810" style="s2">a adult way</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.860" end="01:06:39.120" style="s2">but the dialectic with that if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.200" end="01:06:41.190" style="s2">just snap your fingers and get there</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.120" end="01:06:43.110" style="s2">because you want to there&#39;s work that it</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.190" end="01:06:44.970" style="s2">takes if the if there are unresolved</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.110" end="01:06:47.670" style="s2">child trauma type things that keep</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.970" end="01:06:49.350" style="s2">hijacking you into that state pretending</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.670" end="01:06:51.810" style="s2">that that&#39;s not the case and saying oh</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.350" end="01:06:53.250" style="s2">yes I feel very calm and centered and</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.810" end="01:06:55.110" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking like an adult I&#39;m freaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.250" end="01:06:59.790" style="s2">out inside whatever like then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.110" end="01:07:01.290" style="s2">just schism in your self and so I want</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.790" end="01:07:03.150" style="s2">to see people showing up as an adult and</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.290" end="01:07:04.770" style="s2">that means I want to see them seeing</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.150" end="01:07:06.420" style="s2">where they aren&#39;t and doing what it</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.770" end="01:07:09.420" style="s2">takes to actually get there rather than</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.420" end="01:07:10.950" style="s2">pretend and where they aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.420" end="01:07:12.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t them to have shame about it but</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.950" end="01:07:13.350" style="s2">I also don&#39;t want them acting on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:15.420" style="s2">world from that place I want them acting</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.350" end="01:07:16.710" style="s2">on themselves and then I want them</p>

<p begin="01:07:16.710" end="01:07:22.920" style="s2">right place to act on the world I want</p>

<p begin="01:07:22.920" end="01:07:26.490" style="s2">see somebody sharing information and</p>

<p begin="01:09:05.839" end="01:09:10.370" style="s2">actually reinvent schooling well in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.020" end="01:09:12.350" style="s2">much better way in education because we</p>

<p begin="01:09:12.350" end="01:09:15.739" style="s2">with health care the same with the food</p>

<p begin="01:09:19.400" end="01:09:23.390" style="s2">worse or we can use as catalyst makes</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.830" end="01:09:25.009" style="s2">things much better to be able to do the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.390" end="01:09:27.200" style="s2">larger macro things we have to be in the</p>

<p begin="01:09:27.200" end="01:09:31.549" style="s2">so we work on that first and then the</p>

<p begin="01:10:56.369" end="01:11:07.939" style="s2">slowdown yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.179" end="01:11:10.380" style="s2">and counterintuitive and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.939" end="01:11:14.010" style="s2">think yeah just overall kind of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.380" end="01:11:19.619" style="s2">this appetite for bias and really</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.010" end="01:11:21.829" style="s2">understanding it is a powerful outcome</p>

<p begin="01:12:25.190" end="01:12:32.510" style="s2">approaching and at that time here yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.290" end="01:12:35.810" style="s2">we covered a lot of principles and</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.510" end="01:12:37.340" style="s2">biases and just a lot of insight is</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.810" end="01:12:39.710" style="s2">there anything else you would offer one</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.340" end="01:12:41.540" style="s2">thing we&#39;re asking people&#39;s are there</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.710" end="01:12:48.590" style="s2">any vocabulary terms that people can</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.540" end="01:12:50.900" style="s2">insert into their daily weekly use that</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.590" end="01:12:53.510" style="s2">would enable them to kind of upgrade</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.900" end="01:12:58.720" style="s2">their their ability to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.510" end="01:12:58.720" style="s2">world there are certain things that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.750" end="01:13:02.870" style="s2">unfortunately though this is not</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.890" end="01:13:05.090" style="s2">absolutely the case a community of</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.870" end="01:13:07.190" style="s2">practice that in general looks at</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.090" end="01:13:10.700" style="s2">critical thinking and logical fallacies</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.190" end="01:13:12.620" style="s2">and they&#39;re the ones that look at bias</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.700" end="01:13:15.830" style="s2">the most or very very frequently in</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.620" end="01:13:18.890" style="s2">terms cognitive bias that whole field in</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.830" end="01:13:23.200" style="s2">my opinion admits a certain bias which</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.890" end="01:13:26.590" style="s2">is kind of funny which is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.200" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">biasing towards analysis over synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.590" end="01:13:32.030" style="s2">so we wants to make sure that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:34.490" style="s2">having any wrong ideas and it rejects</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.030" end="01:13:35.990" style="s2">wrong ideas but it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.490" end="01:13:37.640" style="s2">making sure that the very partial</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.990" end="01:13:40.310" style="s2">reductionist ideas are being put</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.640" end="01:13:44.540" style="s2">together in good overarching frameworks</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.310" end="01:13:47.030" style="s2">which is the synthesis side so it there</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.540" end="01:13:49.220" style="s2">is a need for synthetic thought and</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.030" end="01:13:52.790" style="s2">creative thought as well as very</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.220" end="01:13:54.380" style="s2">analytic thought and so the the tools of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.790" end="01:13:57.260" style="s2">critical thinking generally help you</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.380" end="01:13:58.580" style="s2">with the analytic thought more and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.260" end="01:14:00.980" style="s2">those are necessary but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.580" end="01:14:02.210" style="s2">sufficient and there are places where</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.980" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">there are rules of thumb that are not</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.210" end="01:14:08.300" style="s2">true there rules of thumb</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:09.860" style="s2">so like the Occam&#39;s razor right</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.300" end="01:14:14.780" style="s2">sometimes the thing that is true</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.860" end="01:14:16.190" style="s2">actually is more complicated then you</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.780" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">know the hypothesis than something else</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.190" end="01:14:29.630" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a general kind yeah and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:29.930" style="s2">we might say that statistically that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.630" end="01:14:33.650" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.930" end="01:14:35.690" style="s2">often the case but it also even depends</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.650" end="01:14:37.460" style="s2">upon the scenario like the simple</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.690" end="01:14:41.750" style="s2">economic models are always really wrong</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.460" end="01:14:43.130" style="s2">and the simple biological models are</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.750" end="01:14:44.810" style="s2">always really wrong as the causation is</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.130" end="01:14:48.380" style="s2">actually complex so really depends on</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.810" end="01:14:51.170" style="s2">the domain so in terms of terms I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.380" end="01:14:53.060" style="s2">people just going and looking up</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.170" end="01:14:55.880" style="s2">epistemology and reading the Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.060" end="01:14:57.500" style="s2">page or the Oxford philosophy page and</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.880" end="01:15:03.770" style="s2">just kind of having a basic sense is</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.500" end="01:15:05.870" style="s2">good looking up and then if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.770" end="01:15:08.600" style="s2">do the Wikipedia rabbit hole thing so</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.870" end="01:15:09.980" style="s2">it&#39;ll if it mentions Bayesian analysis</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.600" end="01:15:11.480" style="s2">take it take a little trip down there</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.980" end="01:15:14.060" style="s2">and maybe go watch a couple YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.480" end="01:15:16.040" style="s2">videos on Bayesian analysis and on</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.060" end="01:15:18.470" style="s2">network theory on graph theory on</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.040" end="01:15:20.900" style="s2">statistics on learning basics things</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.470" end="01:15:22.700" style="s2">about statistics on as you&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.900" end="01:15:24.710" style="s2">the terms epidemiology and biology and</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.700" end="01:15:26.750" style="s2">immunology so much maybe just read the</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.710" end="01:15:28.190" style="s2">Wikipedia page to start like do I know</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.750" end="01:15:29.810" style="s2">what a virus is do I actually know what</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.190" end="01:15:31.790" style="s2">RNA is what&#39;s the difference between a</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.810" end="01:15:33.950" style="s2">and DNA do i I&#39;m hearing PCR and</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.790" end="01:15:36.020" style="s2">serological and immunological do I know</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.950" end="01:15:37.580" style="s2">what the words mean how about I just</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.020" end="01:15:42.680" style="s2">look up the words that I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.580" end="01:15:44.750" style="s2">especially before I use them that and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.680" end="01:15:45.980" style="s2">don&#39;t have to read a textbook read a</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.750" end="01:15:47.570" style="s2">Wikipedia page to at least have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.980" end="01:15:49.100" style="s2">beginning sense which will actually help</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.570" end="01:15:50.540" style="s2">to Humble you because you&#39;ll realize</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.100" end="01:15:51.860" style="s2">that there was much more that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.540" end="01:15:54.650" style="s2">even know that you didn&#39;t know about and</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.860" end="01:15:56.090" style="s2">then you&#39;ll probably as you know more</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.650" end="01:15:57.770" style="s2">actually be more humble in your</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.090" end="01:16:01.460" style="s2">presentation than has you knew less and</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.770" end="01:16:03.110" style="s2">just repeated a word so okay in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.460" end="01:16:05.090" style="s2">words I would suggest every word that</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.639" end="01:16:18.020" style="s2">yeah and kind of we ask every I guess</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.610" end="01:16:19.489" style="s2">luxury to come up with an activity I</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.020" end="01:16:22.250" style="s2">feel like that could be a good lonnis</p>

<p begin="01:16:22.250" end="01:16:27.040" style="s2">go down a rabbit hole kind of see where</p>

<p begin="01:16:27.040" end="01:16:31.400" style="s2">kind of guideposts along the way as</p>

<p begin="01:16:46.940" end="01:16:56.389" style="s2">fully mm-hmm and we&#39;ll read about them</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.290" end="01:16:59.050" style="s2">and then follow those rabbit holes super</p>

<p begin="01:19:10.230" end="01:19:13.809" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t want to do the hard</p>

<p begin="01:19:30.909" end="01:19:34.480" style="s2">research to see that it&#39;s if something</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.710" end="01:19:36.699" style="s2">is probably not grounded and then if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.480" end="01:19:38.409" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to go further then do an</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.699" end="01:19:39.489" style="s2">adequate preface I looked into this</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.409" end="01:19:40.599" style="s2">here&#39;s what I could find here&#39;s what I</p>

<p begin="01:19:42.070" end="01:19:45.789" style="s2">data on such-and-such and then tag the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.139" end="01:19:46.929" style="s2">people that you think are probably the</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.489" end="01:19:59.230" style="s2">makes a lot of sense and just like I</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.349" end="01:20:01.179" style="s2">think well yeah I&#39;m going to like</p>

<p begin="01:20:03.070" end="01:20:08.409" style="s2">research I think so many people have</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.099" end="01:20:09.610" style="s2">become my customs are just giving</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.409" end="01:20:12.369" style="s2">information from other people who have</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.610" end="01:20:14.139" style="s2">already done the synthesis and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.369" end="01:20:16.239" style="s2">going back to a couple points ago you</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.139" end="01:20:19.239" style="s2">were saying there&#39;s a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.239" end="01:20:23.380" style="s2">kind of analysis oriented tools and not</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.239" end="01:20:26.950" style="s2">as many synthesis tools or those thumber</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.380" end="01:20:29.170" style="s2">or networked in that realm how can</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.950" end="01:20:33.360" style="s2">people kind of balance that out for</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.170" end="01:20:35.710" style="s2">themselves so this thing that is often</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.360" end="01:20:38.230" style="s2">attributed and quoted to Einstein</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.710" end="01:20:39.610" style="s2">talking about imagination being as</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.230" end="01:20:42.250" style="s2">important or more important than</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.610" end="01:20:47.170" style="s2">intellect and creativity and those types</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.250" end="01:20:52.830" style="s2">of thinking or intuition right so there</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.170" end="01:20:55.600" style="s2">was this process that Einstein had where</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.830" end="01:20:58.180" style="s2">he would be working on the math on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.600" end="01:20:59.710" style="s2">chalkboard or on the paper until he hit</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.180" end="01:21:01.989" style="s2">a diminishing return and he just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.710" end="01:21:05.440" style="s2">making progress and then he would take a</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.989" end="01:21:07.840" style="s2">break and he&#39;d go puff his pipe and look</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.440" end="01:21:11.380" style="s2">at the clouds and kind of zone out for</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.840" end="01:21:12.670" style="s2">plays violin kind of zone out then at a</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.380" end="01:21:15.219" style="s2">certain point in the zoning out an idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.670" end="01:21:17.200" style="s2">would pop and then he&#39;d go back with</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.219" end="01:21:25.630" style="s2">that idea to the whiteboard and work on</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.200" end="01:21:27.190" style="s2">it so now I&#39;m going to say a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.630" end="01:21:28.450" style="s2">for what&#39;s happening neurologically that</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.190" end="01:21:31.420" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if is actually how</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.450" end="01:21:33.700" style="s2">neurology works but and times I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.420" end="01:21:35.489" style="s2">specifying that this is not a absolute</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.700" end="01:21:40.270" style="s2">mechanistic statement it&#39;s a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.489" end="01:21:44.680" style="s2">so that there is this kind of left</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.270" end="01:21:46.960" style="s2">hemispheric more cereal more analytic</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.680" end="01:21:50.469" style="s2">process and then there is a more right</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.960" end="01:21:54.340" style="s2">hemispheric more parallel more synthetic</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.469" end="01:21:56.620" style="s2">process and the corpus callosum has a</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.340" end="01:21:58.600" style="s2">largely inhibitory or shunting process</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.620" end="01:21:59.980" style="s2">between those and the analytic process</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.600" end="01:22:02.050" style="s2">actually has to shut off for a little</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.980" end="01:22:04.870" style="s2">while for the synthetic process so the</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.050" end="01:22:06.550" style="s2">analytic is this axioms these data these</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.870" end="01:22:08.590" style="s2">logical transforms this because this</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.550" end="01:22:10.810" style="s2">because this therefore this so</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.590" end="01:22:12.250" style="s2">logistically right and the other one is</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.810" end="01:22:15.550" style="s2">a pattern analysis of look for</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.250" end="01:22:17.260" style="s2">everything like this and then AHA that</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.550" end="01:22:18.310" style="s2">seems to come out of nowhere I think of</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.260" end="01:22:20.710" style="s2">his intuition but didn&#39;t come out of</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.310" end="01:22:22.570" style="s2">nowhere it&#39;s just that process doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.710" end="01:22:24.280" style="s2">happen consciously in the same way who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.570" end="01:22:26.850" style="s2">actually beyond the bit bandwidth of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.280" end="01:22:26.850" style="s2">conscious mind</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.950" end="01:22:30.850" style="s2">and that that then can give a new</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.020" end="01:22:32.170" style="s2">insight but we don&#39;t take it as absolute</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.850" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">truth we didn&#39;t have to plug it back</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.170" end="01:22:35.230" style="s2">into the other process and see how it</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:37.930" style="s2">works but then once you hit diminishing</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.230" end="01:22:40.360" style="s2">return there go back to this one and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.930" end="01:22:42.790" style="s2">think it was Wigner might have been</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.360" end="01:22:44.980" style="s2">teller but I think is Wigner who about</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.790" end="01:22:47.530" style="s2">the physicists the great physicists who</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.980" end="01:22:51.460" style="s2">developed modern physics said we all</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.530" end="01:22:53.410" style="s2">knew that in terms of raw horsepower von</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.460" end="01:22:55.000" style="s2">Neumann was the smartest like he could</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.410" end="01:22:56.770" style="s2">just figure out and he could do the</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.000" end="01:23:00.910" style="s2">math faster than any of us is obvious</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.770" end="01:23:02.020" style="s2">but for all of his cleverness Einstein</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.910" end="01:23:05.680" style="s2">still was the one with the deepest</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.020" end="01:23:08.020" style="s2">insights and some reason for that it</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.680" end="01:23:12.130" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just straight clock speed it was</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.020" end="01:23:16.600" style="s2">something else right so I would say</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.130" end="01:23:21.310" style="s2">there is the study read fact check and</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.600" end="01:23:23.230" style="s2">then also go let yourself have that in</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.310" end="01:23:25.930" style="s2">mind don&#39;t distract onto the laundry</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.230" end="01:23:27.940" style="s2">list or whatever and then meditate look</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.930" end="01:23:29.830" style="s2">at the clouds oh now and then see what</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.940" end="01:23:31.720" style="s2">ideas come and journal goes down and</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.830" end="01:23:35.590" style="s2">then go back right let yourself kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.720" end="01:23:39.340" style="s2">have both of those processes and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.590" end="01:23:42.010" style="s2">find the facts as best you can and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.340" end="01:23:42.990" style="s2">also step back and consciously try to</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.010" end="01:23:47.260" style="s2">put them together</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.990" end="01:23:49.480" style="s2">what kind of overarching picture or</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.260" end="01:23:50.740" style="s2">narratives or whatever might make sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.480" end="01:23:52.060" style="s2">but be careful because it might not be a</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.740" end="01:23:55.090" style="s2">simple narrative it might be lots of</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.060" end="01:23:58.330" style="s2">overlapping ones right but try to see</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.090" end="01:24:00.790" style="s2">with this overarching kind of frame make</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.330" end="01:24:03.730" style="s2">sense of lots of these and then say well</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.790" end="01:24:06.040" style="s2">if that was if this narrative was true</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.730" end="01:24:07.630" style="s2">what else would be true and go look to</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.040" end="01:24:10.720" style="s2">see is that there not what would falsify</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.630" end="01:24:12.760" style="s2">or verify this narrative or this</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.720" end="01:24:15.780" style="s2">hypothesis or kind of overarching</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.760" end="01:24:15.780" style="s2">structural frame</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.630" end="01:24:23.930" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.440" end="01:24:32.270" style="s2">so yeah those are some things what other</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.930" end="01:24:33.560" style="s2">offerings are ways to people I think you</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.270" end="01:24:35.480" style="s2">shared these there were these couple</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.430" end="01:25:28.940" style="s2">not very updated</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.420" end="01:25:32.180" style="s2">Facebook&#39;s FRA the best place I find</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.940" end="01:25:34.990" style="s2">that the the earnestness and the</p>

<p begin="01:25:36.270" end="01:25:42.100" style="s2">comes from something that you could</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.680" end="01:25:44.380" style="s2">think of as a spiritual impulse there is</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.100" end="01:25:47.800" style="s2">like actually a reverence for reality</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.380" end="01:25:52.180" style="s2">that wants to understand it there is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.800" end="01:25:54.580" style="s2">respect for and yeah there&#39;s a respect</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.180" end="01:25:56.380" style="s2">for the integrity of reality and a</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.580" end="01:25:58.960" style="s2">reverence that wants to and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.380" end="01:26:01.210" style="s2">like if you have a lover and you really</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.960" end="01:26:02.980" style="s2">want to love them well you want to know</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.210" end="01:26:04.870" style="s2">their childhood stories and what they</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.980" end="01:26:06.760" style="s2">love in their favorite color flower and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.870" end="01:26:08.110" style="s2">their favorite songs and whatever so</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.760" end="01:26:09.640" style="s2">that you can actually love them well and</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.110" end="01:26:11.050" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ll ever fully</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.640" end="01:26:13.210" style="s2">know them you shouldn&#39;t ever think that</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.050" end="01:26:15.040" style="s2">but that you want to know them better as</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.210" end="01:26:18.700" style="s2">an expression of the love that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.040" end="01:26:19.840" style="s2">and so and that&#39;s not the only thing you</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.700" end="01:26:23.140" style="s2">want you don&#39;t just want to know them</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.840" end="01:26:24.760" style="s2">you also want to have union with them</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.140" end="01:26:26.320" style="s2">you also want to serve them right well</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.760" end="01:26:28.690" style="s2">the same is true the reality writ large</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.320" end="01:26:29.740" style="s2">where you want to seek to understand it</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.690" end="01:26:31.810" style="s2">not that you will ever understand it</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.740" end="01:26:34.030" style="s2">completely but the desire to understand</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.810" end="01:26:36.460" style="s2">more is a kind of cognitive or</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.030" end="01:26:38.920" style="s2">intellectual closeness or intimacy with</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.460" end="01:26:41.770" style="s2">reality it&#39;s a sign of a certain respect</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.920" end="01:26:44.410" style="s2">and reverence and love and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.770" end="01:26:48.730" style="s2">something just profoundly beautiful in</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.410" end="01:26:50.350" style="s2">that and it&#39;s also and that&#39;s where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.730" end="01:26:52.960" style="s2">motivated by what you just call pure</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.350" end="01:26:54.550" style="s2">desire to know or pure learning but</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.960" end="01:26:56.500" style="s2">where it&#39;s motivated by the desire to</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.550" end="01:26:57.910" style="s2">make a difference in the world I would</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.500" end="01:26:59.110" style="s2">like these people not to be dying I</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.910" end="01:27:00.190" style="s2">would like to have a solution that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.110" end="01:27:02.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t create an authoritarian state</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.190" end="01:27:04.150" style="s2">because I care about freedoms that then</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.080" end="01:27:06.490" style="s2">also is I want to understand reality</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.150" end="01:27:10.120" style="s2">enough to be effective motivated by my</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.490" end="01:27:12.130" style="s2">love for people for nature for reality</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.120" end="01:27:14.890" style="s2">and my desire to serve so the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.130" end="01:27:18.250" style="s2">where the energy to do the work comes</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.890" end="01:27:20.500" style="s2">from is actually love and the deep the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.250" end="01:27:22.270" style="s2">more you deepen your love and care the</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.500" end="01:27:24.040" style="s2">more energy you will have to do the work</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.270" end="01:27:27.130" style="s2">that it takes to have that love and care</p>

<p begin="01:28:17.840" end="01:28:23.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a minute there&#39;s a little thing I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.570" end="01:28:25.010" style="s2">like to offer here so good and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.869" end="01:28:28.510" style="s2">philosopher a friend of mine shared with</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.010" end="01:28:28.510" style="s2">me it was very profound as</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.110" end="01:28:39.040" style="s2">fear is not the opposite of love fear is</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.690" end="01:28:42.130" style="s2">a reaction to love it is sourced in it I</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.040" end="01:28:44.170" style="s2">can only be afraid of something being</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.130" end="01:28:47.409" style="s2">harmed that I don&#39;t want to have be</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.170" end="01:28:50.739" style="s2">harms that I care about and so when</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.409" end="01:28:52.239" style="s2">people are totally apathetic ready to</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.739" end="01:28:53.739" style="s2">commit suicide don&#39;t feel fear around</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.239" end="01:28:55.540" style="s2">dying don&#39;t feel fear around hurting</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.739" end="01:28:57.369" style="s2">other people whatever because there is</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.540" end="01:29:01.420" style="s2">no love or care that is binding them</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.369" end="01:29:03.489" style="s2">still if I and let&#39;s say I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.420" end="01:29:04.929" style="s2">any fear over something being destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.489" end="01:29:09.369" style="s2">I don&#39;t care about them like it let</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.929" end="01:29:12.369" style="s2">it burn down so the fear is a response</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.369" end="01:29:13.989" style="s2">to something I love and care about where</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.369" end="01:29:16.480" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about it getting harmed in</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.989" end="01:29:20.679" style="s2">the future I&#39;m afraid of going crazy I</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.480" end="01:29:22.989" style="s2">it&#39;s because I actually love life and my</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.679" end="01:29:24.610" style="s2">own ability to be sane and to connect</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.989" end="01:29:27.190" style="s2">and contribute and to take care of my</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.610" end="01:29:28.960" style="s2">family and to experience whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.190" end="01:29:33.219" style="s2">right like there&#39;s actually a value</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.960" end="01:29:35.619" style="s2">reverence on that now the fear might be</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.219" end="01:29:37.000" style="s2">a unconscious response I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.619" end="01:29:38.409" style="s2">consciously saying I would like to get</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.000" end="01:29:40.000" style="s2">afraid now so it&#39;s an unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.409" end="01:29:42.190" style="s2">response and it might be a disempowered</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.000" end="01:29:44.530" style="s2">or disempowering response but it still</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.190" end="01:29:47.920" style="s2">derives its energy from the depth of</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.530" end="01:29:49.630" style="s2">what is cared about so I can do a</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.920" end="01:29:51.550" style="s2">conscious and empowering response</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.630" end="01:29:52.960" style="s2">instead where I say oh I care about this</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.550" end="01:29:55.210" style="s2">thing so instead of focusing on</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.960" end="01:29:56.860" style="s2">automatically unconsciously what the bad</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.210" end="01:29:58.389" style="s2">outcome is going to be in feeling like I</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.860" end="01:30:00.070" style="s2">can&#39;t do anything so I just get afraid</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.389" end="01:30:01.300" style="s2">what is the good outcome I would like</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.070" end="01:30:04.480" style="s2">and what can I do about it</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.300" end="01:30:07.900" style="s2">so I get empowered in that so I move the</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.480" end="01:30:12.010" style="s2">fearful to careful full of care right</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.900" end="01:30:16.059" style="s2">and act from there anger also comes from</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.010" end="01:30:18.369" style="s2">love sadness also does the apathy would</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.059" end="01:30:21.849" style="s2">just be like I&#39;m not angry not</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.369" end="01:30:23.829" style="s2">and so they might all be unconscious I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.849" end="01:30:27.010" style="s2">not choosing to feel that they might all</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.829" end="01:30:29.020" style="s2">be disempowering or empowering but you</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.010" end="01:30:30.820" style="s2">can find conscious and empowering where</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.020" end="01:30:33.190" style="s2">the anger becomes more like passion and</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.820" end="01:30:34.750" style="s2">the sadness becomes more like depth of</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.190" end="01:30:36.610" style="s2">appreciation and gratitude and fear</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.750" end="01:30:39.420" style="s2">becomes more like carefulness and</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.610" end="01:30:39.420" style="s2">proactivity</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.810" end="01:30:44.460" style="s2">any of those emotions don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.880" end="01:30:46.890" style="s2">them as bad think of them as signals of</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.460" end="01:30:48.660" style="s2">something that is cared about and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.890" end="01:30:50.280" style="s2">trace it back to what is it that I</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.660" end="01:30:51.420" style="s2">actually love and care about and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.280" end="01:30:53.400" style="s2">what is it that I want to have happen</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.420" end="01:30:58.440" style="s2">and how can I actually be empowered</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.400" end="01:31:01.050" style="s2">towards yeah I had a realization a</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.440" end="01:31:04.230" style="s2">couple of months ago instead of washing</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.050" end="01:31:06.330" style="s2">away fear seems cinema the side of a</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.230" end="01:31:08.190" style="s2">river I&#39;m seeing it doesn&#39;t step in</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.330" end="01:31:12.240" style="s2">stone and the other side of the river</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.190" end="01:31:13.920" style="s2">being bravery I&#39;m saying it as yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.240" end="01:31:17.100" style="s2">logical response but I love it in</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.920" end="01:31:20.970" style="s2">children with love yeah and that fearful</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.100" end="01:31:24.270" style="s2">careful play on words this is very</p>
