<p begin="00:01:35.430" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">order to properly befriend ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.470" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">set up an excellent foundation and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">platform for the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:48.770" style="s2">mindfulness and the second of the court</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:48.770" style="s2">for is finding your root now this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.939" end="00:01:56.630" style="s2">particularly influenced by Tai Chi Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.570" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">so many people come to meditation</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.630" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">because they&#39;re very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:03.350" style="s2">relaxing and of course that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:07.619" style="s2">central of people&#39;s mind right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.350" end="00:02:12.120" style="s2">because of you know the extra stressors</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.619" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">were facing which are significant but we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:15.150" style="s2">have to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:17.459" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to get a form of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.150" end="00:02:19.650" style="s2">relaxation that&#39;s good for mindfulness a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.459" end="00:02:22.769" style="s2">form of relaxation that will actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.650" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">more properly connect us in an adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.769" end="00:02:27.989" style="s2">manner to the world so what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.209" style="s2">to do is get you to see the contrast</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.989" end="00:02:32.609" style="s2">between the normal relaxation that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.209" end="00:02:34.829" style="s2">all understood and to which we are you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.609" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">know I deeply habituated this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.829" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">drug session you do when you want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">move towards falling asleep right you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">start to dull your mind your body</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:46.139" style="s2">becomes insensitive your awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">the world decreases your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.139" end="00:02:51.629" style="s2">monitor and manage your mind decreases</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">and you pass into unconsciousness and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.629" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">course this is tremendously valuable I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:59.819" style="s2">not criticizing it in any way but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:02.579" style="s2">not what we want here we don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.819" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">relaxation that takes us into</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.579" end="00:03:06.359" style="s2">mindlessness</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:08.549" style="s2">we want a relaxation that actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.359" end="00:03:13.109" style="s2">enhances and takes us deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.549" end="00:03:15.480" style="s2">mindfulness so a good place to look for</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.109" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">that is in the martial arts especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.480" end="00:03:19.349" style="s2">things like Tai Chi Chuan being what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:20.940" style="s2">call the internal martial arts because</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.349" end="00:03:25.049" style="s2">they really have spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.940" end="00:03:28.079" style="s2">working on this kind of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.049" end="00:03:30.659" style="s2">relaxation relaxation for mindfulness so</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.079" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">if you see like a martial artist they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.659" end="00:03:35.669" style="s2">often do something in the tradition I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">was taught what&#39;s called sort of finding</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.669" end="00:03:40.650" style="s2">your root I won&#39;t stand out but you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:42.030" style="s2">they sink down and then their arms sink</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.650" end="00:03:44.790" style="s2">and you can see that they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.030" end="00:03:46.500" style="s2">elastic now obviously what they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.790" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">trying to do there is to become</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.500" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">unconscious because that would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:51.359" style="s2">extremely dangerous what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:52.769" style="s2">well the relaxation that we&#39;re doing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.359" end="00:03:54.659" style="s2">sort of modeling with my arms or what</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.769" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re relaxing their</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.659" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">arms because they&#39;re trying to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:02.099" style="s2">place where they&#39;re actually increasing</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">the sensitivity in their arms in their</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.099" end="00:04:05.879" style="s2">hands and they&#39;re also trying to find a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">place of stability because that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.879" end="00:04:10.079" style="s2">combination of stability and sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:13.889" style="s2">and the kind of position they&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.079" end="00:04:15.299" style="s2">is multi out for like transforming this</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.889" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">part you don&#39;t fight with this posture</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.299" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">obviously but this posture has you sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:23.130" style="s2">of multiply act really well set to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:25.590" style="s2">the adaptive changes rapidly that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">need to make so there&#39;s with rooting</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.590" end="00:04:29.909" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do is where</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:32.580" style="s2">x2 you find that point of sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.909" end="00:04:34.889" style="s2">and stability and the tradition astiz</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.580" end="00:04:38.729" style="s2">called invitation tradition this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.889" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">called being as still as a mountain but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.729" end="00:04:43.439" style="s2">as alert as a warrior and so the martial</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:45.650" style="s2">art metaphor that I&#39;m using here is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.439" end="00:04:48.810" style="s2">actually appropriate for this tradition</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.650" end="00:04:51.629" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to teach you how to find</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.810" end="00:04:53.849" style="s2">your route now like before with finding</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.629" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">your Center I will talk you through it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.849" end="00:04:58.919" style="s2">but so don&#39;t start doing it right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">let me describe it to you so when I use</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.919" end="00:05:03.150" style="s2">certain phrases and terms when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">talking you through it you&#39;ll understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.150" end="00:05:07.830" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about so what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.400" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">to ask you to do when we start it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.830" end="00:05:11.430" style="s2">bring your mind you know tension in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:13.620" style="s2">awareness to the top of your head and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.430" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">then I&#39;ll say wash your attention what</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.620" end="00:05:18.419" style="s2">do I mean by wash I mean don&#39;t jump your</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:20.819" style="s2">attention from here to your eyes but</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.419" end="00:05:23.639" style="s2">wash your attention awareness to your</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.819" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2">eye area okay and then when I get to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.639" end="00:05:28.349" style="s2">ayah your eye area I&#39;ll say I want you</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:29.699" style="s2">to I want you to pause and look and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.349" end="00:05:33.089" style="s2">I mean by that is I want you to become</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.699" end="00:05:36.719" style="s2">aware of this area any tension any</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.089" end="00:05:38.460" style="s2">tightness in detangling you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.719" end="00:05:41.009" style="s2">sensations that are here any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.460" end="00:05:42.779" style="s2">any imminent information that&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.009" end="00:05:44.460" style="s2">to come into your awareness that we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.779" end="00:05:46.440" style="s2">normally back rounding or ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.460" end="00:05:49.139" style="s2">because it&#39;s not you know super salient</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.440" end="00:05:51.240" style="s2">to us and so what we want to do right is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.139" end="00:05:52.830" style="s2">we want to look at it like so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.240" end="00:05:57.300" style="s2">notice the change when you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.830" end="00:05:59.069" style="s2">seeing and I ask you to look see what</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.300" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">happens when I ask you right to go from</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.069" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">just seeing me or just seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:07.620" style="s2">situation to looking over there right</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">you&#39;re getting that added attention that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.620" end="00:06:12.629" style="s2">is getting you present and coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:14.279" style="s2">that area so you know looking you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.629" end="00:06:16.289" style="s2">trying to do anything you&#39;re not trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.279" end="00:06:19.770" style="s2">to make yourself feel better there might</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.289" end="00:06:22.229" style="s2">be unpleasant sensations there so be it</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.770" end="00:06:25.319" style="s2">so you&#39;re going to be looking and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.229" end="00:06:27.509" style="s2">I&#39;ll say listening and this is even more</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.509" end="00:06:31.110" style="s2">for looking hearing is to listening but</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.939" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">what I try to pick up on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.110" end="00:06:35.490" style="s2">metaphorically is like when you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">party and there&#39;s lots of people talking</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">that&#39;s in front of you so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.479" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">doing is you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:46.250" style="s2">creating that special sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:48.140" style="s2">channel for them so you first look and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.250" end="00:06:50.690" style="s2">then you&#39;re listening you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.140" end="00:06:52.820" style="s2">opening yourself up sensitizing yourself</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.030" end="00:07:03.940" style="s2">loosening here is when you try to relax</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.100" end="00:07:07.580" style="s2">the area but this is a crucial point</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.940" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">you&#39;re relaxing not to make anything go</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.580" end="00:07:12.320" style="s2">away or make anything better you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:07:12.320" end="00:07:17.900" style="s2">do is get some stability and sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.350" end="00:07:21.020" style="s2">you&#39;re loosening to enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.900" end="00:07:23.900" style="s2">listening that&#39;s the kind of a lack</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.900" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">I&#39;ll say let it flow and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:31.880" style="s2">that is let it fill your awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:34.280" style="s2">it sort of unfold almost like a movie</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.450" end="00:08:00.920" style="s2">trying to increase sensitivity and yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.260" end="00:08:04.940" style="s2">remain deeply stable within that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.920" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">sensitivity so letting it flow and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.940" end="00:08:08.810" style="s2">letting it go means you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:12.710" style="s2">be attached to this you&#39;re not gonna get</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.400" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">breathing okay with belly breathing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.290" end="00:35:28.810" style="s2">seems needed it&#39;s a good idea if you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:30.340" style="s2">this is also from crema to not sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.810" end="00:35:32.620" style="s2">your nose is stuffed up and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.340" end="00:35:35.770" style="s2">do mouth breathing when you do that put</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.620" end="00:35:38.470" style="s2">your tongue oh bob bit like you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.770" end="00:35:40.390" style="s2">say pee or duck and hold it there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.470" end="00:35:42.970" style="s2">breathe over and your moist tongue</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.390" end="00:35:45.490" style="s2">because that will help keep your air</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.970" end="00:35:47.290" style="s2">passages moist mouth breathing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.490" end="00:35:49.510" style="s2">generally a bad idea and you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.290" end="00:35:51.190" style="s2">trying to get too much baby breathing so</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.510" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">again try not to force it</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.190" end="00:35:56.170" style="s2">give it time it will gently come over</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:58.420" style="s2">you it&#39;s best if you can if your nose is</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.170" end="00:36:00.220" style="s2">unplugged to new noise breathing nose</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.420" end="00:36:01.960" style="s2">peeping not know he&#39;s breathing because</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.220" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">that will help keep your air passages</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.960" end="00:36:07.290" style="s2">moist and you&#39;ll need that when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:07.290" style="s2">start to meditate for longer periods</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:15.730" style="s2">Nicolas olymic err why take a day off</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.050" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">each week that the most meditation</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.730" end="00:36:19.750" style="s2">courses do that sometimes when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.630" end="00:36:42.580" style="s2">give up unplugging on Sundays it will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">good for people to have a day where</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.580" end="00:36:47.230" style="s2">they&#39;re just trying it on their own I</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:49.450" style="s2">understand that it is very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.230" end="00:36:51.070" style="s2">there&#39;s research showing this -</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.450" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">meditating with other people and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.070" end="00:36:55.120" style="s2">a figure there it helps you to practice</p>

<p begin="00:36:57.880" end="00:37:02.740" style="s2">people but it&#39;s good also to put in one</p>
