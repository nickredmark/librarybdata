<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:15.040" style="s2">okay well we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.440" end="00:00:15.040" style="s2">um as friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:22.240" style="s2">to reinvent your friendship or</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.880" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">philia um to use the greek word yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.240" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">which is a deeper word that means you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:30.160" style="s2">know i think it means sacred friendship</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">uh in some sense yep and um</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.160" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">i wrote an article a while a long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:35.680" style="s2">ago about about the subject and i</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">rewrote it i sent it to you guys but i</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.680" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">i think the the um the thesis</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:42.879" style="s2">is is really that that friendship is is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">not a commodity</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:47.120" style="s2">uh that it&#39;s sacred that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">vulnerable thing that it&#39;s it&#39;s risky</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.120" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not something cheap that can</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">you know uh um bought and sold on social</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.360" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">and and uh so i tried to i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2">write down my article in ten sentences</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:04.960" style="s2">the first sentence was uh friendship is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:04.960" style="s2">how we steal the culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.119" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">um um because that sort of makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:10.240" style="s2">to me would you would you agree with</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">that john because you&#39;re the originator</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.240" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">of that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:19.360" style="s2">um i think so um i mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">so for me philia captures</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">two terms um that we should maybe try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">bring into</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:27.200" style="s2">discussion together it obviously</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">captures fellow</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.200" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">it captures friendship like you said uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">but uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">the the invocation of the stealing of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:36.479" style="s2">the culture um</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">also invokes the model i was using which</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">was uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">christianity in the period of late</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">antiquity and then the crit</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">well then the notion i want to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">is the christian notion of fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">uh where fellowship um right is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">not it&#39;s not the same it&#39;s not to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:54.079" style="s2">identified with friendship but nor can</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:57.040" style="s2">you keep it distinct</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.079" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">um and philia covers both i think philia</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.040" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">is the love that emerges out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">and is in the care for things that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">that are living it that are living and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">and so the christian notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">fellowship was the philia that emerged</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">out of and sustained the body of christ</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">right uh the church as the body of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">christ so and and the med and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">of course bodies are self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">they&#39;re auto-poetic they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">self-making living things and and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">philia</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">uh and in so far as it was associated</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">also with um</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">wisdom is that there&#39;s the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">community like the school</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">right uh because pythagoras coins the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">term and he simultaneously founds a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">community a school</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">right where so there&#39;s fellowship out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">the school emerges</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">right a kind of love right that uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">it emerges out of the community but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">also sustains the community as its</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">organizing principle as its logos and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">then it it is but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">self-organizing it&#39;s like a living thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:57.440" style="s2">it is directed towards something it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">the philia for sophia</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">the the the love of wisdom and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">i i think that uh if we could bring</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">um that notion of fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">the pythagorean christian notion if</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">into aristotle&#39;s notion of friendship as</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">the idea of a suke in two bodies</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">so that the bodies get a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">principle a shared life</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">between them like the bodies of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">people like the people in the church</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">yeah i think there&#39;s a profound uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">discourse that we could open up there</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">between that aristotelian idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">and and the pythagorean christian idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">of sort of friendship fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">yeah so i will share the fellowship is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">about a quest</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">too which that&#39;s what yes yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">fellowship of the ring i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">about the fellowship of the ring and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a quest so that&#39;s that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">dimension uh of friendship which i i</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">hadn&#39;t considered</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">and that&#39;s very much within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">pythagorean tradition because for</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">pythagoras</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">you were on a quest for wisdom literally</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">a soul flight towards wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">um and so and that&#39;s where that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">really gave</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">uh mythological teeth to the uh notion</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">of wisdom as</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">a a profound kind of self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">so the questing ella i</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">thank you for bringing that out andrew</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly also intended</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">in things like the fellowship of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">ring and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">eros as the love that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">comes out of and uh nurtures emergence</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">by leah as the love that emerges out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">and nurtures self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2">and then agape is the love that um that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.160" style="s2">that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.919" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">and and helps sustain the way things</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.160" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">emanate</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">uh you know and so i&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">playing with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">the metaphysical correlations of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">three kinds of love as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s the final thing i</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">want to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">um and then i&#39;ll let you guys respond is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to bring the pythagorean</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">christian the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">and then this final notion you might</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">call it the uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">the neoplatonic or dialectic of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">philia</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">as the important uh uh mediation</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">between eros and agape as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">okay great yeah i was sort of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">that this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">we could focus on philia maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">but uh if if we if we bring in all three</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">that that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">as well of course because because</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">everything is very interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">well i do want to focus on finally but</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying is i think there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">aspects to it and i think they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">related the aristotelian aspect the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">pythagorean christian aspect</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">and what we might call the dialectic or</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">neoplatonic aspect</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">of it great</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.759" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">i&#39;m glad you brought in the um the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">aristotelian notion of the shared the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">tsuke because that&#39;s something that then</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:51.759" style="s2">is developed i think further developed</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">in christianity augustine i think uses</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">some of the same language</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">can you tell us that&#39;s what suke means</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">i see okay yeah it also it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">covers</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">soul and mind it&#39;s in the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">psychology psyche</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">and it also means that about you which</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:12.639" style="s2">is self-moving</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">so it also it&#39;s part of this self-moving</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.639" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of soul and psyche mixed</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">together as a dynamic principle of some</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">kind yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">yeah basically okay and that that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">two opens the door to add one more</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">dimension to what you&#39;ve just said john</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">to understand friendship authentic</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">friendship and maybe later on we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">also talk about maybe make some</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">distinctions between authentic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">inauthentic friendship</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">because i think that would be probably a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">very fruitful territory</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">for us to venture into because our the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">landscape is rife with</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">inauthentic friendship um and i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">it&#39;s very important for us to qualify</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">what we mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">but i think that the there&#39;s a uh a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">socratic self-knowledge in the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">of genuine and reciprocal authentic</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">because friendship authentic friendship</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">i think makes manifest</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">the realization that one cannot know</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">being known in return the project of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">and being known are conjoined projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">the conjunctive nature of those of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">projects is something that is only</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">realized</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:23.680" style="s2">in deep friendship in philia so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">couldn&#39;t you put the two together then i</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.680" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">what i&#39;m thinking of is sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">interject but maybe you can riff on this</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">right the idea that you know the friend</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">friends are each other&#39;s divine double</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">um because that you get the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">shared suitcase because the divine</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">double</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">is right the same suitcase in two bodies</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">or two locations</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s an aspirational relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">to them yes but you also get the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">pythagorean quest</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">right the aspirational quest um between</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">yes yes exactly the friend the friend</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">becomes a symbolic vow</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">by whom you pursue your authentic self</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">and um and to whom you pursue your</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">authentic self too right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">also affording them</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">the same thing that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">because the the if i can use the you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">that we often use especially when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">talking about dialogue we often use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">the fire metaphors the metaphors of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">campfire and so maybe to reintroduce</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">the the light that is kindled in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">virtue of friendship is the light by</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">which you uncover</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">yourself right and without which you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">cannot</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">uncover yourself um and so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">so understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">the project of self-knowledge almost in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">a meiodic way of of uncovering</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">recollectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">that of yourself which is not yet known</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">there seems to be a deep necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">friendship in the cultivation of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:47.279" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">um and then the other thing i might</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.279" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">throw in too you know you i remember you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">said something actually to me john</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">a long time ago and then i read</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">something similar i think in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">in seneca um seneca has a has an epistle</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">on friendship</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">and and he says something quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">beautiful it&#39;s very similar to something</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">you once said to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:06.959" style="s2">and then proceeded to live out</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">incidentally um</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.959" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">which is that the the a friend</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">is one against whose death</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">you stake your life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">now we could we could think of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">literally of course but we could also</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">think of death as</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">the the soul&#39;s despair and i to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit more of a helpful</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">way of thinking about it so i might say</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">friend a friend is what is a soul</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">against whose despair we stake our life</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">and there is a sense in which a real</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">the cultivation of a real friendship</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re at a real friend</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">a real friend is someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">in whose fate you implicate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">yeah a soul who in whose fate you become</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">implicated</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">voluntarily implicated and who brings</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">you uh who lifts you up from despair</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">at the same time right yes with whom you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">despair</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">and with whom you recover and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">also just stare from it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s yeah that&#39;s so beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.560" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">yeah so you&#39;re picking up on the one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">the essential features of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">the the suitcase is that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.200" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">self-knowing the self-caring</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">and then that gets extended uh through</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">another person</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s right they become conjunctive</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.760" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">they become conjunctive and that i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">that also serves maybe to to connect up</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">to the insight that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">um in in a way that that friendship has</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">that mediatory function between</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">you know the the knowing and the being</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">of oneself and the knowing and being of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">of of the world writ large right the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">countenance of one and the countenance</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">are are reconciled or resolved</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">in the relation of friendship yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">because the uh so you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">something like the friendship</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">is where we get the second person</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">perspective that mediates between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">first and the third person perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">that&#39;s right and forms the bind and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">there and thereby forms the religio the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">binding</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s an interesting thing because</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">it&#39;s always perplexed me</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">um phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">uh because obviously linguistically</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">conceptually we have the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">and second and third person forums we</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s indisputable</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">and and we&#39;re picking up on something</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">that has some sort of phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">functional basis i get that but</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">like as a phenomenological exercise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">very easy like</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">like if you&#39;re sitting in meditation for</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">example you can adopt the first person</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">perspective sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">this here now or you can adopt the third</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">person&#39;s perspective no one nowhere no</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">but what is it like what is it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">doing when you move into the second</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s this weird stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">thing where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">looking out through your eyes but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">also looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">back through the through the the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">beloved other</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">right and yet those are somehow fused</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">a unified perspective the second person</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">is a very odd like i&#39;m trying to i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">trying to get us to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">remember before we were in dentio the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">strangeness</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:21.120" style="s2">and the oddness uh in comparison to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">first person</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.120" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">perspective and the third person</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">perspective the second person</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">perspective is very very odd indeed</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">very very odd indeed and i wanna i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">see how that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">the the weirdness of the second person</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">perspective the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">the way it binds the two others together</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">so there&#39;s a way in which it binds</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">the first and the third person</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">perspective as you said chris and then i</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">want to bring back what i was saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">there&#39;s something about friendship</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">fellowship the way it binds us</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:49.760" style="s2">into something that takes on a life of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:52.800" style="s2">its own right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.760" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">a friendship right a friendship isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.800" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which both people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the analogy to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">dear logos a friendship draws people</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">a friendship takes on a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">and it leads both</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">of its members or more than two people</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">right there&#39;s joy there&#39;s more you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">friendships larger than that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">right but it leaves them place it like</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">it takes on a life of its own and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">it takes that&#39;s what happened i mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">that&#39;s the myth of the fellowship of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">ring</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">they like the holy spirit it&#39;s the yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.000" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">the third yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.079" style="s2">why do you say it&#39;s weird john what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">the weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.079" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">is it is it just because um because if</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">you&#39;re if you you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">well you&#39;re this isolated let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">um atomistic if you like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">meditating</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">and and you don&#39;t have that sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.199" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">perhaps it becomes a sterile exercise um</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">it could</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">and if you and if you don&#39;t have and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">else and and you you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">there has to be this this this</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">devotional sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">in some sense to to another another</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">principle higher principle it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">person or not otherwise i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck in the i it relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">and you don&#39;t get into the vow</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">um i i i acknowledge all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">what i meant what i meant and weird is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">uh let me try and articulate it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">the grammar of our assumed metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">first person perspective max onto</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">third-person perspective maps onto</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">what does a second-person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">map onto</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">yeah neither and both</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">and yeah you know yeah well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve been trying to get with this notion</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">of transactivity transactivity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">yeah and so friendship friendship is one</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:43.920" style="s2">of our most powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">of inhabiting and disclosing the trend</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.920" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">transactivity as something of equal</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:50.000" style="s2">standing</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">and i think even more primordial</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.000" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">standing because of the way it mediates</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">and grounds</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">subjectivity and objectivity and i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">our culture and this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">things i&#39;ve been arguing for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">while right</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">because our culture doesn&#39;t speak about</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">transactivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">at all very much i think it it it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">largely</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">at its metaphysical depths incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">speaking about the grounding of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">okay so we have the sacred notion of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">friendship which</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve been explored and then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">profane</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">uh aspect of friendship which is you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">everywhere today it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">reduced to its</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">to a commodity it&#39;s been reduced to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:35.199" style="s2">kind of casual notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.480" style="s2">where everybody you associate with is is</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.199" end="00:15:38.560" style="s2">your friend</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.480" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">on some level and it&#39;s it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.560" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">something that people you know facebook</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.440" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">billions of dollars you know on this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">notion a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">friend so so um can you can you explore</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">those book</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">can you guys explore those two aspects</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">and the difference between them</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">but i think it follows on what i was</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">just saying i think because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">uh because we&#39;ve lost the connections</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">friendship and fellowship and because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">the the metaphysical home in transit</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">activity for friendship</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">i i think i think it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">for us to get to the depths</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">of friendship and friendship becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">just a casual relationship where you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">kind of get your rocks off with your</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">i think friendship you&#39;re not building</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">towards this something or</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">you&#39;re not creating a symphony together</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">something like that you know yeah i i</p>

<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">grammar that takes you into ontological</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">depth perception you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">you&#39;re going to degrade and default to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">the lowest common denominator</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">and what is the lowest common</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">denominator well it&#39;s it&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">association</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">we associate and we use that we used to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">have more fine-grained distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">so i mean i i understand what chris</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">meant by inauthentic but</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">what i mean is we used to have authentic</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">categories that were non-friendship</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">there were there were literally your</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">associates acquaintances</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">there were your acquaintances and there</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">were your associates and there were your</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">and these were not understood to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">friends nor should they be friends</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">and then we got the weird sitcom thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">that happened where now everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">your family</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">and everybody is your friend and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">like well no</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t want that because that removes</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:23.839" style="s2">the distinctness</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">of friendship i i want people that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.839" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">good colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">and i will appreciate them as good</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">colleagues but i don&#39;t want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">friend and i want people who are my</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">acquaintances</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">and and and and we and we we even</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">invented a new term</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">um in modernity or recently that i</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">thought captured a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">another category that you had the buddy</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">and the buddy isn&#39;t a friend and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">one of our biggest mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">the buddy is somebody that you do fun</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">things with</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">they&#39;re your buddy like they&#39;re your hey</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">there&#39;s my rollerblading buddy</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">right and that and that&#39;s mine because</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:00.880" style="s2">right we&#39;re not we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">legislate the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">relationships but what we&#39;ve done again</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">lack the ontological death perception is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">all those distinctions have collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">and that is adulterated adulterated and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">confused our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.720" style="s2">so that we have this well as you said it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">this profane</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.720" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">notion of friendship because it is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">notion that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">muddied and equivocal and has lost</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">the important intelligibility that all</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">those distinctions gave us</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">if i can be like uh bring this down to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">something like uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">you know for for men for example</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.919" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">the the pleasure of a shared activity</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">and of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">drinking beer with somebody at a</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the same thing as like</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">fellowship like you&#39;re saying when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">go to church</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">and what happens i mean it&#39;s an archaic</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">term now</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">i but when i was growing up and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">church we used to use the term</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">edification</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">like edifice like building a building we</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">were engaged in the project of building</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">each other up in the christian life yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">yeah so one of the things so taking what</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">both of you have said and maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">viewing it from then from a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">different vantage one</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">thing then one property that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">to distinguish one kind from the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">first as you said john that one is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">we might call a real or authentic</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">again not a definition just a property</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">is that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">contingent on a shared context that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">then repeated and reproduced</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">it is it rather than being reproduced by</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">a shared context it is it in and of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">reproductive of then the context in</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">which you can share the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">and so to me that gives the feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">what we when we say real or authentic</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">friendships</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">they do not rely on the contextual of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">predetermined world</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">to find relevance and significance</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">rather they create and unfold between</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">that shared context and world that then</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">becomes enveloping of all other things</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">oh that&#39;s good that&#39;s why that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re in the presence of a real</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">deep friend it truly does not matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">yeah you can sit with them on a log in</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">the woods</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s enough that&#39;s enough it it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">and to me that&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing and then the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">other is that up on that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">that&#39;s really worse i find that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">brilliant i won&#39;t talk a lot i won&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s brilliant i think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">articulated and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.240" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">extrapolated what i was trying to convey</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">with this idea of the love that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">and cares for</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">something that has a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">that&#39;s self-organizing i think what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">just said there was brilliant and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">articulated it perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">yeah right also we can bring that to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">level of of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">you know what i said in the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">culture you know uh uh still</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">just individual uh it&#39;s like that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s how that&#39;s how we create</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">a culture that is living rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">culture that is just based on in these</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">institutional forms that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s exactly right um</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">and and then the second thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re obviously they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">they&#39;re interrelated is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">the the i&#39;m going to put this in scary</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">quotes but the real friendship</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:22.559" style="s2">is is infinitely dissimilar from all</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">other friendships</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">it is incomparable to any other it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">it is a co it is a kind and not an</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">instance right</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">it is not comparable to any other</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">freight so you know andrew you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">talking about you know you have your</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">people that you go to the pub with and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">drink beer and watch football</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">and um there is a degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:45.360" style="s2">all of those friendships are similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">because of their shared context</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.360" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">and it is the dissimilarity of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:55.120" style="s2">singular friendship that marks it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">you know it if it is if it is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.120" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">unto itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">rather than an instance of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.000" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">friendship i think that also is one way</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">of of telling the difference</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">but that like you said that follows</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:07.919" style="s2">perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">from the from the previous point because</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.919" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">if it is a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">that is autonomous literally it creates</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">that it creates the no</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">moss for itself it creates the laws and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">the standards for itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">because it is a auto it is a self-making</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">a self-organizing thing with a life of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">its own it&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">that uniqueness to it right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">exactly it has to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">i would argue i think i think it&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">think it&#39;s not just a related sequence i</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">think there&#39;s an implication maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">entailment from the first point into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">second point that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">yeah yeah i think you&#39;re right i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">you&#39;re exactly right yeah they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not just two independent</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">properties but they are they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">one one is implicated by the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">implied by the other i mean to say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">and that would then mean right why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">yeah i mean think about how that then</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">goes back to your previous point</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">maybe these the points are cons there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">a consolation forming</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">because in so far i mean i&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">whole course now on the nature and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:12.159" style="s2">function of the self</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">and one of the functions of the self is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to pick out uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">right um so insofar as i share</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">with other people those aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">properties that pick out myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">and there&#39;s problems there with that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">not right</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s some idea that in some way</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">is that about you which individuates you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">and and which picks you out um</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">from other persons um gives you what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">call a personal identity a biographical</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.600" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">identity etc</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:45.679" style="s2">etc um and and we we sometimes transfer</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">that to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">objects like works of art have that kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">of self</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">because right any any painting other</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">than the original</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">night watch by rembrandt is a fraud</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">right because it&#39;s a unique language</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">if you have a deep real friend you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">generate a unique language together</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a great point andrew it&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">else&#39;s language right</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.679" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">right you know and what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:16.559" style="s2">that unique language feeds back into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">point chris was making about</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.559" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">socratic self-knowledge it literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">gives you the language by which you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">bespeak yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:26.640" style="s2">by which you can carve out and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">individuate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.640" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">right in which you can write ah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:32.880" style="s2">a unique language but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">language that allows you to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.880" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">outside of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">of of or outside that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why you speak that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">speak more fully and more truly when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">into the ear of your friendship yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">right because the ear of your friendship</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">right which we might call that third</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">entity the the spirit or the geist as as</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">you and i have called it john</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">when you speak into the ear because its</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">ear is more resonantly comprehending</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">the tenor of your speeches the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">breadth and the compass of your speech</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">suddenly grows</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the totality of its reference</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">grows more encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">because its capacity for comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">is that much more you&#39;re speaking into</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">an entire world when you speak into an</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">authentic friendship and so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">your your</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">your your um you know your voice that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">your vocality takes on a resonance the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">logos takes on a resonance and is able</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">to self-multiply in that heracliton way</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">that it is not otherwise able to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the fecundity</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">of of the world that&#39;s created between</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">two authentic friends</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">right and so what what i&#39;m saying about</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">like they&#39;re they&#39;re i&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">sort of the resonance there and i like</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">in speaking to the depths i have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">from my depths and in speaking from my</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">depths</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">i actually make myself into a new kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:54.159" style="s2">of self and this is the way in which i</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">helped people preserve their humanity</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">when nothing else does</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">heroic individualism and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">that that all gets broken that all gets</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">but the one thing uh that undermines it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">the one thing that is not undermined is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s telling that in 1984</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:23.120" style="s2">um orwell gets this because what he does</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">the most horrific thing he does is he</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">ultimately undermines the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">and the friendship between winston and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">julia</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:30.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s when they lose their soul</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">loses and that&#39;s the whole point of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">if you if you read the book you realize</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">the whole point of the party is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.399" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">absolutely destroy the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">friendship and fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">so that the only thing that&#39;s left is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">the devotion to big brother</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">and the market and the state are trying</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">couple thoughts while you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">one is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">um that you know this kind of friendship</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">is is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">um temporal like you could have friends</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">from books or you could have friends</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">that are that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">have passed away or that you no longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">talk to or you know uh you can cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">in all kinds of places that you could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">alone and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">at times solitude is more of a place to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">a generous uh genuine friendship than</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">you know in the crowd um</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s a really good point</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">and also that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">it also seems that um</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">there is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something about those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">friendships that are also both voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">involuntary simultaneously i think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">it&#39;s important to understand that too</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s frank&#39;s first it&#39;s frank&#39;s first uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">voluntary necessity</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">volunteering necessity was always a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">voluntary necessity</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right you enter into</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">it you find that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">uh you couldn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t be without</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">it right</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">because then suddenly suddenly you live</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">in a world in which it is presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">yes exactly and and once you live in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">world in which that friendship is</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">presupposed</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">it cannot be discarded right because it</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">becomes like it becomes a fundament of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.159" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">your being</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">as such i use those terms deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">you&#39;re being as such begins to depend</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">upon it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s not something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">hasten into you can&#39;t rush into it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">you also can&#39;t contrive it</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing i think sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">people think you know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">formulaic about people when they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">convergent interests and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">personalities that would seem bios by</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">all psychometric criteria to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">compatible</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">and you know what sometimes it just does</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">not work and that does that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">romanticize it necessarily but there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">there is and must be deep mystery within</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">the emergence of authentic friendship</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">some some of it has to remain mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">must always remain mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">i like that um i like the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing out the involuntary</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:15.839" style="s2">aspect of it the fact</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why you fall in love and this i</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.839" end="00:35:18.640" style="s2">wonder if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">fall in love that that&#39;s actually philia</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">and not eros in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">on some level because because you you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">develop a bond with a person</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">a creative bond with the person that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">that that endures through time and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">not merely uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">you know an erotic thing it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:38.400" style="s2">it develops more from aeros into philia</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">or or something like that are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.400" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">following my</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">yeah well plato came out yes talks about</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">a shift in it within eros itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">he talks about like there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">kind of eros that&#39;s the consumptive eros</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">so right you want it you you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">one with something in and you consume it</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">yeah right and then he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">pack that it you can it could flip</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">and you can get this move where eros</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">goes from being consumptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">eras to being generative eras and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">says when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">and he he gives a prototypical example</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">of encountering beauty</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">and wanting to make more beauty you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">don&#39;t want to consume the beauty so it</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">disappears into you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not the direction the direction</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">is the other way you want to make more</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">beauty in response to the beauty you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">and then he indicates that that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">preparing you for</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">right the philia in the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:28.800" style="s2">relationship yeah and that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">could be married for a long time right</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.800" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">you because it&#39;s because you keep going</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">with that creation of beauty you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t end somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">uh along the way i&#39;m sorry i just i was</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">just thinking that you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">that the the essence of the husband-wife</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">right is is really is really about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">is you know we&#39;re talking about</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s also the essence of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">husband-and-wife relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">i i think cause you say your wife is</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">person because there&#39;s so many other</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">options</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">is because you&#39;ve you&#39;ve gone beyond</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">that state</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">where you can continue to to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">continue to to create this beauty that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about or</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">which isn&#39;t necessarily something so</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">tangible or</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s also a unique language as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">been talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">i think i think so i think the spousal</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">different from friendship not because of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">absence but but because of excess</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">i think the spousal relationship should</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">have all three loves</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">um uh at least the generative form of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">eros</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">definitely philia in both the friendship</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">and fellowship sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">but also agape um uh there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">which you&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">you&#39;re helping to midwife you&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:47.280" style="s2">to give birth to that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">uh aspirational self there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">you&#39;re taking you&#39;re doing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">engaged in the love of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">uh and of course the problem with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">with an adult</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">right is to not do that in any way</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s patronizing or condescending</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s precisely i think the eros</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">and the philia that counterbalance that</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">that pretentious patronizing aspect</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">danger at least of agape but i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">it&#39;s also agape</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">that makes sure that the eros doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">become consumptive</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">and i think what is mediating between</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">all of them and keeping them going</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">like you said andrew is philia and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">and so if you look at sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">measures of long-term relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">yeah the phyllis team tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">but especially for long-term</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">relationships there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">gothic element into it like chris said</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">you the gothic element is you help</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:42.079" style="s2">like you&#39;re a world through which the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">other you give birth to a world</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.079" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">to which the other person can come into</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">who and what they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">that or or to use it another way andrew</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">you there&#39;s an agape in creation elect</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">creating a unique language</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">by which that other person can come into</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">articulation</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:02.160" style="s2">um so i think i think all of them i i</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">i hesitate to speak like i have any</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">authority about this because</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">i mean i mean i&#39;m in such a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">now but uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">trying to get uh relationships to last a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">lifetime is not something yet i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">succeeded in</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">so i have to bow to your expertise on</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:17.599" style="s2">this uh but oh no</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">from what i&#39;ve seen and from what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.599" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">observed and from what i</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">have good reason to believe i&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">participating in</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">and and from the research i&#39;ve looked at</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">this i think if you have all three</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">and they shift around in what is</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">prominent at any one stage in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">right you know you know there&#39;s periods</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">where um the erotic aspect can come to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">the fore or the friendship aspect</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">or the agothic aspect sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">yeah i mean i think again again it the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">if that argument is right and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">interpenetrating the degree to which we</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">have denuded</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">right and diminished friendship is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">the other two are also denuded and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">diminished</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">and and the way they all relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">other is also denuded</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">and diminished i think it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">coincidence that the people that only</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">you know facebook friends have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">tremendous difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">having committed romantic relationships</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not a coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">that&#39;s not a coincidence at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:21.839" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s also something kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">interesting in the um</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.839" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">incidentally before i say this you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">all of all of this serves to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">serves to depict what is at stake</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">in the loss of friendship you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">um i know for myself the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">the um the quaking of that foundation</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">the prospect of the loss of a friendship</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">and of that intensity i can&#39;t i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">speak to the spousal relationship but</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">if i can return it momentarily to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:05.760" style="s2">philia of friendship</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">the loss of which to me is such a it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.760" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">brings a kind of existential</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:13.839" style="s2">stress that in my experience very very</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">few things can compare</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.839" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">um because when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">when your life begins to presuppose that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:30.839" style="s2">foundation</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">and begins to presuppose the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.839" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">reproduction from the worlds that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">opened by those</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">friendships the risk of the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.599" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">those worlds is tantamount to the risk</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:44.960" style="s2">of the loss of soul to bring it back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">despair for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s funny and that&#39;s why it is such a</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">seismic</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">threat at least in my mind an experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.880" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">when you know even if there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">imminent threat of the loss thereof if</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">there&#39;s even a sort of a real</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">disruption to the foundation of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">worlds</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">the um i think the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">the the existential consequences of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">and the follow-up from that can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">incredibly pernicious</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">and deleterious to the living of to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">lived life and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">understanding though and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">those stakes i think is very very</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:23.040" style="s2">important to the treatment of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">friendships</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.040" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">you know because it helps to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">that in treating those friendships you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">are not treating them</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">as mere you know what we&#39;re treating</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">them duly as</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">the worlds they are and um</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">and and and often you know sometimes too</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">friendships to take your point about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">consumptive eras john and how you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">the concept</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">the difference between the consent of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">eros and the generative eras</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">that very difference often is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">is is is the difference that makes for a</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">world or a fruitful world</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">in the soil of that friendship you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve hit moments in my life where</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve realized</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">that a friend whom i cherished very</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">was in fact my what was what was</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:21.520" style="s2">driving my the need i had that drove</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">my pursuit of that friendship was of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">consumptive erotic nature and of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:26.240" style="s2">i mean erotic in the broader sense not</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">in the sexual sense right</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.240" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">but there was a there was a consumptive</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">eros that was actually an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">determinant</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">of the relevance of that friendship to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:38.960" style="s2">i&#39;m sure yeah we i know we many of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.440" style="s2">that experience isn&#39;t that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">like everybody goes through that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.440" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">you have to you have to threshold that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">you have to go through and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">yes i discovered this poem i wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.359" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">long time ago for a woman</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">and it was just this barrage of sex and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">death and and you know every kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">melodrama you can even imagine it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">just it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">pouring out of my unconsciousness you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">know we all go</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">through that right and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like the romantic has to die or</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.839" end="00:44:13.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like that need you know whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">is that that consumptive erotic need</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">that can sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">move friendships with a force that goes</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">unseen to you has to be made opaque it</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">has right it&#39;s the transparency opacity</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">shift that has to happen you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">become conscious and aware</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s meiotic and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">you have to become conscious of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">nature of your need</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">and how rapacious it is and then and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">then sometimes in so doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.400" end="00:44:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like a sacramental process</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">in so doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.440" end="00:44:41.359" style="s2">a friendship and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">potential of a friendship can be renewed</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.359" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">in that process it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">mean the death of a friendship</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">it can actually mean the renewal of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">friendship and the reopening of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">back into the the motive i thou and</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">and when that happens i find especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">if it&#39;s requited</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">it is such a profound experience yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">and i was thinking that friendship is</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">also in stages like</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">like when you were talking i thought of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">the period when you when when things</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">become translucent or transparent is</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">when you become an adult</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">on some level so yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">like becoming a mature friend</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">um there there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:20.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an evolution to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:20.880" style="s2">friendship it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">thing yes i was thinking chris as you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">were talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">i was thinking about because we often uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:34.079" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">the the mythos around these perennial</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">i was thinking about the vampire myth as</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">like the zombie myth is the myth of uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">you know what we&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">with with philip the myth of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">but the the vampire myth strikes me as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">as a really appropriate myth</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">of especially because of all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">perversions of christian fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:57.760" style="s2">that are within uh the vampire because</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">the vampire is</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.760" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">someone who sucks the life out of you uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">and the consumptive hunger is is</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">insatiable</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">um not in the same way not in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">mindless way of the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">but in the way in which i it is i mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">vampires are sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">quintessential narcissists</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">right that everything is drawn and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why they literally have the power</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">of drawing attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">right you know you know the bella legusi</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:25.760" style="s2">example is famous for that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">and then i wonder if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.760" end="00:46:31.040" style="s2">that the vampire</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">represents how we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.040" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">deeply betray by leah</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">the fact that we have gone through this</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">cultural movement of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">making the vampire sexy and fun</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t that maybe a way in which our</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">is unconsciously indicating</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been talking about here that</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.640" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">it has lost</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">the understanding of friendship because</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">it&#39;s lost the horror of the vampire</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">the vet being a vampire is cool you get</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">to live for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">and all that right and it&#39;s like no you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">the vampires are all 20 somethings now</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">which is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:10.240" style="s2">the age of narcissism right when yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">when 20s you&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.240" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">you&#39;re self-obsessed you haven&#39;t learned</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">about that that&#39;s even in one of those</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.079" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">horrible books by ann</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">rice but the idea of the perpetual the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:33.760" style="s2">the the immortality is also a perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">immaturity</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">so the youth obsession of our culture</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:13.359" style="s2">and the trivialization</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">that han talks about so much in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">agony of eras</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">that then that would also feed into your</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">and also help another loop explaining</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">and so without i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">so without phylia there&#39;s no dear logos</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">and there is no capacity</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">for that kind of knowledge the</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">constantly running the autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">yes yes yes yes except the autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">remains literal autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:28.720" style="s2">because one of the things and as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.800" end="00:52:30.079" style="s2">to you know you know what that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.720" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">so you know how when you have a when you</p>

<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">or shared memory if i can put it that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">way using it in the augustinian sense of</p>

<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">yeah memory the memory becomes a world</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">in which to play through</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">the mem the shared memory the commons of</p>

<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">that the the reliving of shared memory</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">has to be a symbolic exercise rather</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">a literal exercise totally it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">instead of triviality or or</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">you know yeah you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">remembrance of this there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">lots of things past yeah yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right andrew i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:25.359" style="s2">i think which is why it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">profound novel right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.359" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s almost like a parable</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:32.400" style="s2">uh parables are things that look like</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">narratives but actually undermine</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.400" end="00:54:36.799" style="s2">narrative from within</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">right uh so because what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.799" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">they they they they they dislodge you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.839" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">from that horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">autobiography and they set you into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">ontology so like the parable of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">prodigal son is</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">right it like i said this before that</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">there&#39;s that that there&#39;s the tension</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">between justice and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">compassion and and and between the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">father</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2">the role of the father and the role of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">the elder son and the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">younger son and if you try to resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">in terms</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:06.240" style="s2">of any one of these things in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:08.079" style="s2">any one of them you lose your humanity</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.240" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">while justice should always plan no</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.079" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">compassion should always plan</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">no the father should always teach no the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">elder son should</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">no the point is and that&#39;s what jesus is</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">doing and he said and then he says</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:19.920" style="s2">he does the typical jesus thing and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">kingdom of god is like this and you go</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.920" end="00:55:23.520" style="s2">oh my</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">about these indulgent people and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">you get to the last five pages of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">book and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">and you go oh my gosh he hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:17.119" style="s2">talking about these people at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">he&#39;s been talking about the american</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.119" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">dream and he&#39;s been talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">collapse of the american dream and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:23.839" style="s2">corrupting us</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">and and you get that you get that drop</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.839" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">into the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">uh-huh drop into the vertical yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">well and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">here&#39;s another pithy way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">friends our ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">they share and they afford the dropping</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">into the vertical for each other</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:41.760" style="s2">yeah yes yes which is why they&#39;re i was</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">gonna say one of the things i wrote down</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.760" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">was that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:46.160" style="s2">if there&#39;s a risk involved in friendship</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">because you can you can lose a friend</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:49.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">and also a friendship a friend is as is</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.760" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">is not something that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not a smooth operation to use on</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">language it&#39;s something that challenges</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re very deep it&#39;s a labor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">a labor to go back to the midwifery</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.960" style="s2">metaphor it&#39;s a labor</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">and so so so i guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.960" end="00:57:10.960" style="s2">sacred again but</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:12.720" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s also a a journey</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.960" end="00:57:14.720" style="s2">and i guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s also hard</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.720" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">difficult you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a tr it can</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.720" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">be a trial uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">sometimes well every relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">every relationship ends in loss right</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:25.599" style="s2">every</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">i mean you know every relationship ends</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.599" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">in law and and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.599" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">you know you if you take a look at uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:31.839" style="s2">because i&#39;ve been teaching all of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.839" end="00:57:35.920" style="s2">you know epicurean the epic we our</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">understanding of epicureanism is is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.920" end="00:57:39.920" style="s2">totally off</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">epicureanism it&#39;s about you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.920" end="00:57:42.720" style="s2">philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">companionship that&#39;s what epic</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">that&#39;s at the heart of epicureanism and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">then of course uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">and then of course within stoicism as</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:52.960" style="s2">and they both they&#39;re both they both</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">venerate friendship</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.960" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">profoundly and deeply but they always do</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:57:58.559" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:58:00.319" style="s2">in the recognition that&#39;s what i meant</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.559" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">about that&#39;s why i was invoking camus</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.319" end="00:58:03.280" style="s2">the plague</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:04.960" style="s2">because every relationship ends in loss</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.280" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">either the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:09.520" style="s2">is betrayed or damaged irreparably or</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:12.559" style="s2">the person dies</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.520" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">right and and and so the stoics the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.559" end="00:58:16.319" style="s2">stoics actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">the the pre-meditation you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.319" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">supposed to remind yourself sati</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">that eat every friendship um every</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">friendship is is is subject to fatality</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:30.319" style="s2">in that way everything even your even</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:33.680" style="s2">relation even relationship to objects</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.319" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">um but the point is not to stop because</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.680" end="00:58:37.680" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">right the point the point is not to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.680" end="00:58:39.839" style="s2">well i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">the point is not uh you know i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.839" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">to pack up my toy my emotional toys and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">go home</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">the point is not it&#39;s the is is</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:48.640" style="s2">precisely the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">it&#39;s to see go ahead oh i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.640" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">thinking that the opposite is also true</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">is this the friend remains with you</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:54.799" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">until you die you know if it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.799" end="00:58:57.680" style="s2">friendship it</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">never leaves so it&#39;s both those things</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.680" end="00:59:00.559" style="s2">are true yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">they are they are and that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">the point and even if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">antagonistic religion relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.640" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">this person</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">and you break up or you they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">still working inside of you on some</p>

<p begin="00:59:19.839" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">crucial</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">it&#39;s almost very crucial to the real</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:25.040" style="s2">friendship because the responsibility is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:28.480" style="s2">is there</p>

<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">insight but he made it famous</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.079" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">that meaning what i would call meaning</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">in life is what sustains you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">not happy</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">when you&#39;re not cheerful when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">content um</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">and what i was what i was suggesting was</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">that friendship is the tutorial</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:59.839" style="s2">for that friendship is where we get the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.480" end="01:01:02.400" style="s2">lived sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">of it being worth it even though there</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:04.720" style="s2">is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:06.640" style="s2">loss even though there is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.720" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">conflict we get a deep</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">and so in the epicureans and the stoics</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">the sense of friendship as where you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:15.240" style="s2">and i want to break this word up to</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">emphasize it where you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.240" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">encouragement where because courage</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:21.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t just fortitude</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">courage is a sense of the meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">life that sustains you</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.119" end="01:01:27.200" style="s2">even when things are going horribly and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">friendship is the place</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">where the stoics and especially the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">epicureans</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">thought we practiced that we thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">well and you have something similar in</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">buddhism andrew</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">you have the buddha and the dharma need</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">the sangha</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">and so i think that the degree</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">also which and you have the spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">friend i think it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">which who is who you you can&#39;t really go</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">very far without that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t and that&#39;s what you see also</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:58.960" style="s2">again in the plague</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:59.440" style="s2">and so again i think and we don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.960" end="01:02:02.319" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.440" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">about this verge virtue i mean we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.319" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">we&#39;ve fallen</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">into a maniacal monologue about justice</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">not even internal justice</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:10.720" style="s2">just social justice social justice is</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:13.119" style="s2">important it really is</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.720" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">but justice and soccerson have to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.119" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">talked about and so does courage</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">and degree to which people are not</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:21.280" style="s2">capable</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">i&#39;m going to make a prediction here</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.280" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">something i think we could actually test</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:26.319" style="s2">i think the degree to which people are</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">incapable of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.319" end="01:02:30.559" style="s2">friendship of a communing relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.280" end="01:02:31.359" style="s2">that we&#39;ve the time we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.559" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">about here</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.359" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">is the degree to which they are not</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:37.440" style="s2">going to get practice in</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:37.920" style="s2">existential encouragement the courage to</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.440" end="01:02:39.839" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.920" end="01:02:42.079" style="s2">the defense against despair and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.839" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">therefore the existential cowards</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.079" end="01:02:45.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a prediction i&#39;m going to make</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:47.280" style="s2">yeah or the degree to which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.359" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">merciful on some level right</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.280" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">i mean um but but those go together</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">cowardice and cruelty powers and cruelty</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">are deeply interwoven and bound together</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:02:59.440" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">they&#39;re deep you cruelty always comes</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.440" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">tremendous insecurity that&#39;s why you see</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">the cruelty of people like trump</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s because he is such a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">coward</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.280" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">right that&#39;s why he that&#39;s also why he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">incapable of real friendship</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:14.799" style="s2">right that&#39;s why you see the cruelty</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">that he sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.799" end="01:03:18.640" style="s2">espouses without giving it a second</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:20.240" style="s2">thought uh because those are bound</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.640" end="01:03:23.359" style="s2">together insecurity</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.240" end="01:03:24.720" style="s2">and cowardice and right and cruelty are</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.359" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">always bound together</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.720" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">yeah well it just occurred to me that</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:30.799" style="s2">justice right</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">uh this idea of justice without the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">of without that sense of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:40.160" style="s2">what fruit what philia and friendship is</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.280" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.160" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">would lead you to be unmerciful and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:47.280" style="s2">cruel and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.440" end="01:03:49.760" style="s2">and and shallow and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.280" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s you know there was a song by</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.760" end="01:03:52.640" style="s2">three dog night</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">which which really dates me really</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.640" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">probably chris doesn&#39;t even know who i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">talking about but you do andrew</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">well there was a song called you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.160" end="01:04:05.599" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">you know it&#39;s easy to be hard and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.599" end="01:04:08.319" style="s2">they&#39;re actually lying in here about you</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.039" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">know people who care about</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">uh justice but but in the line is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">they care about justice but as you said</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">they&#39;re incapable of actual friendship</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">uh with each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:23.119" style="s2">and i think i think the severing the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">attempt to sever justice from fellowship</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.119" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">and even a sense of common wealth and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:31.119" style="s2">ideology becomes the substitute doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:31.119" style="s2">it like uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">shared belief basically we just become</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.680" end="01:04:39.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve become propositional buddies</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">yeah we have a song and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.039" end="01:04:44.559" style="s2">feminine venomous behind it and a</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:45.760" style="s2">you know which which arises with it that</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.559" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.760" end="01:04:49.119" style="s2">gets the where the where the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:52.240" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.119" end="01:04:54.240" style="s2">mechanism kind of comes into being where</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.240" end="01:04:56.240" style="s2">or you want it i don&#39;t know you want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.240" end="01:04:57.280" style="s2">join together with somebody and destroy</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.240" end="01:04:59.839" style="s2">something rather than</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.280" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">join together with somebody and create</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.839" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">if that makes</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:04.319" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s just it&#39;s just group</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:07.440" style="s2">vampires right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.319" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s group vampires yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">yeah the mob mentality kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:15.119" style="s2">um and and and we can mob together with</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">our words as much as we can mob together</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.119" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">with our actions</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">um and that&#39;s problematic that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:23.280" style="s2">again i think the myths</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:24.319" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s a reason why there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.280" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">reason why i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.319" end="01:05:27.760" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s many mythic elements in</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:29.839" style="s2">things like tolkien</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.760" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">but the fellowship of the ring is a myth</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.839" end="01:05:33.839" style="s2">that&#39;s running all the way through</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:36.319" style="s2">and i think the profound attraction for</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:39.680" style="s2">that is for many people</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.319" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">it awakens and it helps them satie to</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.680" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">how much they need friendship how much</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">they need it</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.799" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah because friendship in and</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">of itself is like</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">within within the suffering of life</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.400" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">wow that&#39;s beautiful say that again</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">um friendship cocoons the memory of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">eternal</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:16.640" style="s2">within the intrinsic suffering of life</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">that&#39;s that yeah that&#39;s it for that he</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.640" end="01:06:19.599" style="s2">just sam and frodo on the mountain with</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">all this</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.599" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">you know that the world is collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.119" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">around them that seat yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">but that&#39;s very beautiful yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.119" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">exactly that was beautifully said chris</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.839" end="01:06:34.640" style="s2">well it was just</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">just taking all all that you two just</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.640" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">said and just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:42.079" style="s2">synthesize it in a sense um</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:43.039" style="s2">yeah yeah and that&#39;s why that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.079" end="01:06:44.799" style="s2">expressions of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.039" end="01:06:46.160" style="s2">the sam and frodo example is so</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.799" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">canonical for a good reason</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.160" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">it&#39;s incredibly moving i i i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.480" end="01:06:52.160" style="s2">ceased to be moved by it for precisely</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">that reason because it&#39;s like a pure arc</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.160" end="01:06:58.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like a pure distillation of that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:07:00.480" style="s2">insight and maybe that&#39;s that expression</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:01.359" style="s2">maybe the harry potter books are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.480" end="01:07:04.240" style="s2">the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.359" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">you know in a sense the friendships</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.240" end="01:07:07.039" style="s2">there are all about</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">rebelling against the adult world or</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">something like that or maybe i&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not an excellent i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.559" end="01:07:14.400" style="s2">i think there is authentic friendship in</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">that story but i don&#39;t think that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.400" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that the friendship is as</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:20.559" style="s2">um is as central to the story</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">as it is in lord of the rings because</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.559" end="01:07:24.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the because harry potter is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:25.680" style="s2">messianic story</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a messianic so it&#39;s the death and</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.680" end="01:07:28.720" style="s2">resurrection of christ basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s essentially what harry</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.720" end="01:07:33.760" style="s2">potter is and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s so beloved because it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.760" end="01:07:37.680" style="s2">thinly disguised</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.440" end="01:07:39.839" style="s2">um story of christ but i still wonder if</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.680" end="01:07:42.319" style="s2">it&#39;s beloved for the wrong reasons</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.839" end="01:07:43.119" style="s2">at times uh you know and it&#39;s in the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.319" end="01:07:44.880" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.119" end="01:07:46.640" style="s2">you know just the like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.880" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">talking about is these little groups of</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.640" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">people playing quidditch with each other</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.319" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re sort of like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">it reflects the superficial aspect right</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:58.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">sacred quality yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.160" end="01:08:03.520" style="s2">there there&#39;s a i think chris&#39;s point is</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">the friendships aren&#39;t as pivotal</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.520" end="01:08:07.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:08.880" style="s2">the story is about harry potter and how</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.440" end="01:08:10.480" style="s2">he&#39;s a messianic figure</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.880" end="01:08:11.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s basically jesus and his</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.480" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">disciples</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.920" end="01:08:15.599" style="s2">whereas in whereas in the lord of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:18.480" style="s2">rings the super</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.599" end="01:08:19.440" style="s2">power of the hobbits is friendship</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.480" end="01:08:21.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.440" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">don&#39;t get everybody else has fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.679" end="01:08:24.719" style="s2">abilities</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:26.719" style="s2">but the super power of the hobbits is</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">friendship it&#39;s friendship that time and</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.719" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:32.239" style="s2">time and time again preserves them</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">against the temptation to evil</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.239" end="01:08:35.359" style="s2">again it&#39;s their friendship and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">and the shire</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.359" end="01:08:38.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s the it&#39;s that and the shire</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t a nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:41.759" style="s2">it&#39;s again that sense of fellowship</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.560" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.759" end="01:08:47.279" style="s2">and and and and yeah village</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a village and it&#39;s it&#39;s yes exactly</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.279" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">what the the kind of communities</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.040" end="01:08:53.440" style="s2">i think that we&#39;re sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:55.679" style="s2">trying to create</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">in the wake of the collapse of of</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">civilization right</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:00.319" style="s2">yes yes the smart village book is about</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.319" end="01:09:05.440" style="s2">yeah the smart villages uh future</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">thinkers the civilian of jordan hall</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s all about trying to get the that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">back but</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.040" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">right the the idea is right what makes</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">the hobbits</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:17.679" style="s2">the the the beings that have the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.920" end="01:09:18.319" style="s2">ultimate courage there&#39;s other heroic</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.679" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">figures</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.319" end="01:09:22.319" style="s2">there&#39;s gandalf there&#39;s aragorn but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:23.279" style="s2">only ones that have the courage to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.319" end="01:09:26.400" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.279" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">for me the scene is when sam</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.400" end="01:09:29.520" style="s2">lifts frodo up because he can&#39;t walk</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:32.719" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.520" end="01:09:35.520" style="s2">and he carries frodo too</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.719" end="01:09:36.239" style="s2">right yeah into the it&#39;s the part it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.520" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">the defining</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.239" end="01:09:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the define it&#39;s the fulcrum moment</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:41.759" style="s2">of the entire story</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.440" end="01:09:42.480" style="s2">i think yeah for a good reason yeah very</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.759" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.480" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">and again it comes back to your point</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.679" end="01:09:51.920" style="s2">chris he he lift</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:53.440" style="s2">he literally bears frodo up against</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.920" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">despair</p>

<p begin="01:10:04.320" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a very good image to</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.480" end="01:10:10.719" style="s2">circle around to</p>

<p begin="01:10:26.880" end="01:10:30.480" style="s2">like i i put them out as reinventing</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.040" end="01:10:31.840" style="s2">because i thought reinvention would just</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.480" end="01:10:32.400" style="s2">kind of sound weird and people wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.840" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">get it</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.400" end="01:10:34.880" style="s2">but then people have been writing and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:36.640" style="s2">saying what do you mean reinvent you</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.880" end="01:10:37.679" style="s2">can&#39;t reinvent these things</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.640" end="01:10:39.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not right so it should be</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.679" end="01:10:42.080" style="s2">reinventio so i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.920" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">re-brand our our discussion as</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.080" end="01:10:46.880" style="s2">reinventio and uh um</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.199" end="01:10:48.560" style="s2">i thought that maybe like because i</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.880" end="01:10:49.679" style="s2">really love the subject of friendship</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.560" end="01:10:51.760" style="s2">that the next thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.679" end="01:10:53.280" style="s2">we could if we if we dared to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.760" end="01:10:56.719" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.280" end="01:10:58.719" style="s2">the erotic or or the aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.719" end="01:10:59.760" style="s2">friendship in love another time or the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.719" end="01:11:01.679" style="s2">next time if</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.760" end="01:11:03.040" style="s2">i&#39;d be happy to take that yeah let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.679" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s so much more to say</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.040" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">about this yeah there&#39;s just there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:10.239" style="s2">endless amount of things to say i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.360" end="01:11:11.920" style="s2">but i i would like to explore also the</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.239" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">proposal which has fallen off our</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.920" end="01:11:16.239" style="s2">cultural table</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:17.600" style="s2">but it goes back to perhaps jesus of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.239" end="01:11:18.320" style="s2">nazareth it&#39;s definitely paul it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.600" end="01:11:21.520" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.320" end="01:11:24.000" style="s2">an augustine and an aquinas of love as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.520" end="01:11:24.000" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.239" end="01:11:29.120" style="s2">i want to re i would like to really</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.840" end="01:11:32.159" style="s2">explore that because</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.120" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">the idea we we like we have i was</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.159" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:38.880" style="s2">in the the sangha this morning right</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:41.360" style="s2">how how much we have lost how much we</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.880" end="01:11:43.920" style="s2">perverted the sense of the word passion</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.360" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">right we we do things with passion and</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">we use this word</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2">not realizing that the word passion is</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">related to passive</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.000" end="01:11:52.080" style="s2">and the greek word is pathe from which</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:52.960" style="s2">we get pathetic passion is the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.080" end="01:11:55.040" style="s2">of action</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.960" end="01:11:56.159" style="s2">and we think somehow that the intensity</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.040" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">of feeling</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.159" end="01:12:00.320" style="s2">is what keeps people committed we look</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:02.560" style="s2">because what we&#39;re actually valuing</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.320" end="01:12:03.360" style="s2">is people&#39;s ability to commit to an</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.560" end="01:12:05.600" style="s2">arduous</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">or long-standing task you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.600" end="01:12:07.520" style="s2">anything without passion</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:10.000" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying is you need</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.520" end="01:12:12.000" style="s2">commitment but the ancient idea is</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.000" end="01:12:13.199" style="s2">but feelings are ephemeral no matter how</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.000" end="01:12:16.159" style="s2">intense they are</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.199" end="01:12:16.719" style="s2">right what what keeps people committed</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.159" end="01:12:19.040" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.719" end="01:12:20.880" style="s2">power for committing to the good which</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.040" end="01:12:22.800" style="s2">is exactly what virtue is</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.880" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">virtue is the power of committing to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.800" end="01:12:26.159" style="s2">good and</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:28.159" style="s2">so to my mind i was comparing the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.159" end="01:12:29.040" style="s2">intensity of infatuation i use this as</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.159" end="01:12:30.960" style="s2">an example</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.040" end="01:12:32.400" style="s2">with what you were talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">uh uh andrew</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:38.320" style="s2">the virtue of uh that that</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:38.719" style="s2">that that empowers you and encourages</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.320" end="01:12:40.719" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.719" end="01:12:42.640" style="s2">to stay in a long-term relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.719" end="01:12:43.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not an intense feeling it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.640" end="01:12:45.679" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">so i would like next time if possible to</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.679" end="01:12:49.679" style="s2">talk about love as a virtue</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:50.640" style="s2">love is a virtue sure sounds great and</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.679" end="01:12:52.719" style="s2">uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.640" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">another thing to reinvent right at</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.719" end="01:12:57.040" style="s2">passion yeah wow</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:57.760" style="s2">love is a virtue because because because</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.040" end="01:12:59.280" style="s2">it means</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.760" end="01:13:01.440" style="s2">like so many of these things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.280" end="01:13:03.760" style="s2">living in a time of inversion where</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.440" end="01:13:05.360" style="s2">the thing we think it means is actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.760" end="01:13:08.080" style="s2">almost its opposite right</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.360" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">exactly exactly and you&#39;re right to note</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.080" end="01:13:12.320" style="s2">that we and this is jonathan pajot&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:14.159" style="s2">uh point about we live in the we live in</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.320" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">the topsy-turvy world we live in clown</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.159" end="01:13:17.360" style="s2">world we live in the upside down world</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:20.159" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.360" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">always predictive of the end of an epoch</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.159" end="01:13:24.719" style="s2">and of a civilized</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">end of a civilization it it speaks of</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.719" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">of an imminent death on large scale when</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">all these things</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">all these things have gone through some</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">major inversion yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">talking about love is a virtue and</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.840" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">talking about the inverting of</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:39.199" style="s2">of it&#39;s almost like frodo and sam like</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:41.199" style="s2">the end of all things</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.199" end="01:13:42.400" style="s2">the inversion of all things let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.199" end="01:13:43.440" style="s2">about both of those let&#39;s talk about</p>
