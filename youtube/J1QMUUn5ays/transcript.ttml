<p begin="00:00:05.710" end="00:00:10.370" style="s2">Eric Davis thank you very much for</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.910" end="00:00:14.030" style="s2">taking the time happy to be here so Eric</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.370" end="00:00:15.140" style="s2">you are an author and your work covers</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.030" end="00:00:17.539" style="s2">kind of the intersection between</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.140" end="00:00:20.060" style="s2">technology as a terrorism you&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.539" end="00:00:22.100" style="s2">talked and written about psychedelics so</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.060" end="00:00:23.420" style="s2">those are topics that I&#39;m personally</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.100" end="00:00:23.900" style="s2">very interested in and have been for</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.420" end="00:00:26.090" style="s2">many years</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.900" end="00:00:27.740" style="s2">there are also topics it I found it</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.090" end="00:00:29.180" style="s2">could be difficult to get to get people</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.740" end="00:00:30.920" style="s2">to understand why they&#39;re so relevant</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.180" end="00:00:32.480" style="s2">right now so I thought we would start</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.920" end="00:00:33.980" style="s2">with that and get your take on that why</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:35.870" style="s2">are these important things for us to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.980" end="00:00:37.519" style="s2">looking at right now yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.870" end="00:00:38.809" style="s2">question because I mean I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.519" end="00:00:43.010" style="s2">been writing and thinking about these</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.809" end="00:00:44.839" style="s2">things for a long time since probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:47.809" style="s2">just since then let&#39;s say the early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.839" end="00:00:50.179" style="s2">and in that period of time they were</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.809" end="00:00:51.859" style="s2">pretty esoteric I mean not technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.179" end="00:00:54.379" style="s2">obviously although even then when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.859" end="00:00:56.420" style="s2">first started writing about the early</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.379" end="00:00:58.339" style="s2">internet culture it was still pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.420" end="00:01:00.620" style="s2">small you know before the world wide web</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.339" end="00:01:04.280" style="s2">came out there was a whole sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.620" end="00:01:05.510" style="s2">underground at esoteric freak it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.280" end="00:01:08.990" style="s2">lecture alone</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.510" end="00:01:14.150" style="s2">you know through BBS servers and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.990" end="00:01:15.890" style="s2">know and all you know of groups and muds</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.150" end="00:01:18.260" style="s2">and mousse and so that was like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.890" end="00:01:20.450" style="s2">early my early experience of even kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.260" end="00:01:24.050" style="s2">of digital technology was this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.450" end="00:01:25.850" style="s2">underground that was online and those</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.050" end="00:01:27.170" style="s2">were the sort of first days of virtual</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.850" end="00:01:28.670" style="s2">reality everyone was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.170" end="00:01:30.320" style="s2">virtual reality how that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.670" end="00:01:32.570" style="s2">change everything and then they you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:35.300" style="s2">the physical manifestation of that took</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.570" end="00:01:37.400" style="s2">a lot longer and then these other things</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.300" end="00:01:41.240" style="s2">were marginal in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.400" end="00:01:43.640" style="s2">psychedelics the occult the paranormal</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.240" end="00:01:45.620" style="s2">you know there was they popped up on TV</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.640" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">you had the x-files you know there were</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.620" end="00:01:49.850" style="s2">there were signs of them but in general</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:53.030" style="s2">it was sort of a marginal thing to</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.850" end="00:01:55.909" style="s2">follow and now none of its marginal</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.030" end="00:01:58.310" style="s2">anymore and that&#39;s one important reasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.909" end="00:02:02.810" style="s2">to go why why did this happen why is it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.310" end="00:02:05.570" style="s2">now that investment bankers and fashion</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.810" end="00:02:09.250" style="s2">designers and when academics are</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.570" end="00:02:11.210" style="s2">interested in taking ayahuasca or that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.250" end="00:02:13.640" style="s2">the you know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.210" end="00:02:16.730" style="s2">sort of resurgence of popular culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.640" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">about witchcraft and paganism that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.730" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">are these younger witch movements that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">are coming up and that the occult sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:30.230" style="s2">of permeates more and more of a popular</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:32.380" style="s2">culture what&#39;s going on what&#39;s why is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.230" end="00:02:35.560" style="s2">this all happening now and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.380" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of reasons one is just</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.560" end="00:02:43.700" style="s2">that consumer capitalism likes to find</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:45.830" style="s2">an edge that it can colonize that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.700" end="00:02:49.370" style="s2">some kind of flash so what initially</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.830" end="00:02:50.930" style="s2">appears to be strange and challenging we</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.370" end="00:02:54.050" style="s2">can move into and then more and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.930" end="00:02:56.180" style="s2">people have access to it and it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.050" end="00:02:57.830" style="s2">like a cool thing for a while then after</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.180" end="00:02:59.990" style="s2">a while it gets kind of absorbed and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.830" end="00:03:01.400" style="s2">another fashion trend comes along so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.990" end="00:03:03.380" style="s2">think some of that&#39;s what&#39;s going on but</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.400" end="00:03:06.950" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a more more important</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.380" end="00:03:10.030" style="s2">deeper dimension which is that partly</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.950" end="00:03:12.920" style="s2">because of the spread of Technology a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.030" end="00:03:16.670" style="s2">digital technology of media smartphones</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.920" end="00:03:18.950" style="s2">of the internet of social media that for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.670" end="00:03:21.590" style="s2">a variety of reasons the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.950" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">consensus reality was structured in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.590" end="00:03:27.830" style="s2">past even in the immediate past is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:31.220" style="s2">eroding and as it arose as it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.830" end="00:03:34.010" style="s2">harder to let&#39;s say distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.220" end="00:03:35.900" style="s2">the online world and our physical world</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.010" end="00:03:37.940" style="s2">because now our phones are with us</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.900" end="00:03:40.550" style="s2">everywhere the sensors are with us</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.940" end="00:03:42.380" style="s2">everywhere we&#39;re mapping this real space</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.550" end="00:03:44.390" style="s2">to this space and going back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.380" end="00:03:46.280" style="s2">more and more and we&#39;re looking at our</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.390" end="00:03:48.860" style="s2">phones all day long we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.280" end="00:03:51.800" style="s2">interrupting or physical reality reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.860" end="00:03:54.410" style="s2">with these information flows those two</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.800" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">worlds begin to kind of break down you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.410" end="00:03:59.630" style="s2">know again talking about the 1990s you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:03.110" style="s2">know we had this now very quaint corny</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.630" end="00:04:05.630" style="s2">phrase of cyberspace it was a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.110" end="00:04:07.790" style="s2">place when you got online you went to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.630" end="00:04:09.410" style="s2">cyberspace and in cyberspace there were</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.790" end="00:04:11.720" style="s2">different rules you could be different</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.410" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">characters you could build fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.720" end="00:04:14.990" style="s2">worlds you could meet that ended up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:17.420" style="s2">we don&#39;t think that way anymore</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.990" end="00:04:21.250" style="s2">it&#39;s nice well it&#39;s kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.420" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">interwoven digital read you know actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.250" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">material space this is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:29.790" style="s2">interesting point which one is real you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">know where is in your mind is that kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.790" end="00:04:34.440" style="s2">of cyber what we used to call cyberspace</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:36.750" style="s2">which is blended into our physical space</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.440" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">is it less real is there some underlying</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:41.490" style="s2">reality that it&#39;s kind of masking us</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:43.650" style="s2">from seeing or is it is it just as real</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.490" end="00:04:45.510" style="s2">as everything else well yeah I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.650" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">language of realities are real a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.510" end="00:04:51.150" style="s2">tricky one and you know I think it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:54.090" style="s2">have to kind of define your terms what</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.150" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">do you mean by this and that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.090" end="00:04:57.890" style="s2">that the reason that things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:05:00.990" style="s2">psychedelics and the occult are more</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.890" end="00:05:04.170" style="s2">resonant now is because they both</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.990" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">represent sort of rich and creative</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.170" end="00:05:08.250" style="s2">forms of let&#39;s call it irrationality</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:11.160" style="s2">even though I don&#39;t really like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.250" end="00:05:12.900" style="s2">word because it implies the rationality</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.160" end="00:05:14.750" style="s2">is the real thing and irrationality is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.900" end="00:05:16.680" style="s2">deviation when it&#39;s something more like</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.750" end="00:05:19.650" style="s2">magical thinking or mythological</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.680" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">thinking thinking that does not follow</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.650" end="00:05:24.750" style="s2">along mathematical logic or purely</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">causal physics or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.750" end="00:05:29.610" style="s2">and maybe in the past we know we lived</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">alike in the recent past in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.610" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">century we lived in a physical world</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:38.220" style="s2">that was ruled by the laws of physics</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:41.040" style="s2">and science and chemistry and and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.220" end="00:05:43.920" style="s2">we would escape maybe to films or comic</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.040" end="00:05:45.720" style="s2">books or maybe even we would be in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.920" end="00:05:47.460" style="s2">religion and we&#39;d do something that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.720" end="00:05:48.570" style="s2">kind of different than that I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.460" end="00:05:51.140" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.570" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">even if we&#39;re secular people our</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.140" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">experience of the everyday of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:05:58.620" style="s2">ordinary reality is less and less</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.940" end="00:06:01.950" style="s2">ordinary at least in the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.620" end="00:06:05.250" style="s2">sense because these virtual or</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.950" end="00:06:08.760" style="s2">algorithmic or digital logics are now</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.250" end="00:06:11.010" style="s2">completely embedding themselves in our</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.760" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">not just in our spirit you know in our</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.010" end="00:06:15.720" style="s2">experience of how the world works but</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.620" end="00:06:18.630" style="s2">even our experience of ourselves and how</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:18.990" style="s2">world well let&#39;s let&#39;s take that one</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.460" end="00:10:23.130" style="s2">because I think that what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.990" end="00:10:27.240" style="s2">is is both very true and insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.130" end="00:10:28.680" style="s2">and let&#39;s let&#39;s go with the very true</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.140" end="00:12:58.750" style="s2">he was more or less a libertarian but</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.060" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">not in the evil and ran sense he hate he</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.750" end="00:13:02.980" style="s2">hated and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:06.250" style="s2">and ian&#39;s he was more of like a man of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.980" end="00:13:08.920" style="s2">the people socially conscious but still</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.250" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">radically anarchist kind of person and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.920" end="00:13:14.110" style="s2">so a narc one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:16.839" style="s2">attractive about anarchism in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.110" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">current moment is that it requires and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.839" end="00:13:21.610" style="s2">demands a kind of responsibility that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.240" end="00:13:24.550" style="s2">you take for your own experience for</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.610" end="00:13:26.139" style="s2">your own actions that you can&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.550" end="00:13:27.579" style="s2">you can&#39;t really be an anarchist and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.139" end="00:13:29.829" style="s2">blame everything on everybody on</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.579" end="00:13:32.440" style="s2">everybody else even if it is other</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.829" end="00:13:34.690" style="s2">people&#39;s responsibility so well that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.440" end="00:13:37.089" style="s2">Wilson is coming from this attitude and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.690" end="00:13:39.670" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s starting to notice that if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.089" end="00:13:42.300" style="s2">if you you know start to go down the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.670" end="00:13:44.649" style="s2">occult route take a lot of psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.300" end="00:13:47.500" style="s2">experience with what he calls brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.649" end="00:13:49.240" style="s2">change experience with positive thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.500" end="00:13:51.850" style="s2">or your kind of programming your own</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.240" end="00:13:56.050" style="s2">perceptions the things get very loose</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.850" end="00:13:57.820" style="s2">and very malleable right and but so how</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.050" end="00:14:00.310" style="s2">do you treat that how do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.820" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">that and he really tried to hew to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.310" end="00:14:07.449" style="s2">certain kind of skepticism skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:11.380" style="s2">both in the sense of not really trusting</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.449" end="00:14:13.570" style="s2">things of you know believing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.380" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">evidence is a good thing to try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.570" end="00:14:17.649" style="s2">understand how the world works even if</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:19.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not entirely sufficient but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.649" end="00:14:22.540" style="s2">know definitely paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.480" end="00:14:26.680" style="s2">science and evidence in that sense but</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.540" end="00:14:29.769" style="s2">also embracing a kind of willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.680" end="00:14:33.490" style="s2">not know ultimately what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.769" end="00:14:35.790" style="s2">the story I tell is the one that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.490" end="00:14:38.620" style="s2">doing all this crazy stuff he&#39;s writing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.790" end="00:14:42.610" style="s2">satirical books about conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.620" end="00:14:44.890" style="s2">and occult ideas and mysticism and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.610" end="00:14:47.560" style="s2">radical politics and so he writes this</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.890" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">whole Illuminatus book with a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.560" end="00:14:51.399" style="s2">his that&#39;s full of all this stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.380" style="s2">know it&#39;s very relevant now although</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.399" end="00:14:55.930" style="s2">it&#39;s also you know very much a book of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.380" end="00:14:58.029" style="s2">its times but then once he&#39;s doing all</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.930" end="00:15:00.519" style="s2">these kinds of personal experiments in</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.029" end="00:15:01.260" style="s2">California in the in the midst early mid</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.519" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">70s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.260" end="00:15:07.750" style="s2">basically he kind of loses the plot and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:10.329" style="s2">he enters into a world where he he fully</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.750" end="00:15:12.799" style="s2">believes that he&#39;s receiving</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.329" end="00:15:14.929" style="s2">transmissions from an extraterrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.799" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">intelligence associated with the star</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.929" end="00:15:18.980" style="s2">system serious and he&#39;s getting all</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.139" style="s2">these synchronicities that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.980" end="00:15:22.489" style="s2">supporting this and he&#39;s reading books</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.139" end="00:15:25.749" style="s2">that are supporting it and he basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.489" end="00:15:28.609" style="s2">enters what he calls Chapel perilous and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.749" end="00:15:31.399" style="s2">Chapel perilous is this kind of paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.609" end="00:15:33.829" style="s2">place where all these weird stories are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.399" end="00:15:36.230" style="s2">coming to be very vivid in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.829" end="00:15:38.689" style="s2">he as he puts it there&#39;s only two ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.230" end="00:15:40.910" style="s2">out of Chapel perilous either you come</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.689" end="00:15:42.829" style="s2">out as an agnostic this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.910" end="00:15:45.410" style="s2">skepticism that I&#39;m talking about or</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.829" end="00:15:48.109" style="s2">you&#39;re come out as a stone-cold paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.410" end="00:15:50.119" style="s2">and so he goes through that and he gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.109" end="00:15:51.230" style="s2">out the other side and we kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.119" end="00:15:52.579" style="s2">know talk about that a little bit how</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.230" end="00:15:54.769" style="s2">did he do that how&#39;d he get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.579" end="00:15:57.410" style="s2">and you know in a way it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.769" end="00:15:59.299" style="s2">extreme story of like psychedelic over</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.410" end="00:16:01.549" style="s2">you know too much psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.299" end="00:16:04.129" style="s2">psychosis and things like that but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.549" end="00:16:07.699" style="s2">also believe that it is a very good</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.129" end="00:16:09.980" style="s2">metaphor for us today in terms of we</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.699" end="00:16:11.869" style="s2">need to work with beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.980" end="00:16:14.149" style="s2">understanding and we need to learn work</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.869" end="00:16:16.129" style="s2">with reason and skepticism but even more</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.149" end="00:16:19.610" style="s2">fundamentally than that we need to sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.129" end="00:16:22.699" style="s2">of trust ourselves both in the ability</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.610" end="00:16:29.059" style="s2">to engage alternative possibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.699" end="00:16:30.769" style="s2">then also withhold assent and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.059" end="00:16:33.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not an answer because it made we</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.769" end="00:16:34.939" style="s2">may need to believe certain things so</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.110" end="00:16:36.619" style="s2">strongly like we may need to believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.939" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">certain things so strongly about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.619" end="00:16:40.730" style="s2">climate that we can do nothing but do</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.249" style="s2">the things that will prevent true</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.730" end="00:16:46.100" style="s2">calamity so I&#39;m not saying that you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.249" end="00:16:48.499" style="s2">agnosticism and an unwillingness to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.100" end="00:16:50.839" style="s2">believe is like the answer but on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.499" end="00:16:52.579" style="s2">other hand what I think now is that for</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.839" end="00:16:57.499" style="s2">the most part our information</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.579" end="00:17:00.470" style="s2">environment is toxically driven by memes</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.499" end="00:17:03.559" style="s2">or concepts and that often disguise</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.470" end="00:17:05.389" style="s2">themselves around ironic ideas so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.559" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">think oh I&#39;m just being ironic I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.389" end="00:17:10.549" style="s2">holding things lightly but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:12.439" style="s2">actually starting to become woven into a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.549" end="00:17:14.449" style="s2">certain belief structure or a certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.439" end="00:17:16.309" style="s2">way of seeing seeing the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.449" end="00:17:20.990" style="s2">it&#39;s very important for all of us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.309" end="00:17:25.550" style="s2">practice the ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.990" end="00:17:28.850" style="s2">profound ambiguity with a sense of even</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.550" end="00:17:33.470" style="s2">urgency to resolve it and not resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.850" end="00:17:35.570" style="s2">or be more choosy about how the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.470" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">resolution comes rather than doing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.570" end="00:17:40.370" style="s2">emotional form of resolution which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:43.040" style="s2">often where the trap is yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:45.020" style="s2">there&#39;s paradoxes aplenty in this right</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.040" end="00:17:47.179" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m thinking we use a technique</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.020" end="00:17:49.010" style="s2">in our retreats in our events called</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.179" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">inquiry which originally comes from AHL</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.010" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">mas and kind of diamond essence work we</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:54.140" style="s2">use that a lot and that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:55.220" style="s2">interesting because when you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.140" end="00:17:57.559" style="s2">Enquirer it&#39;s kind of like a talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.220" end="00:17:59.900" style="s2">meditation and there is implicit in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.559" end="00:18:02.809" style="s2">is I don&#39;t know but also there is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.900" end="00:18:05.150" style="s2">implicit sense of there is some truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.809" end="00:18:06.530" style="s2">somewhere even it&#39;s just a personal</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.150" end="00:18:07.880" style="s2">truth of how do I feel about this or</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.530" end="00:18:10.940" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s going on in the space</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.880" end="00:18:12.710" style="s2">right now and so that paradox is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.940" end="00:18:14.150" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a great quote I forgot</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.710" end="00:18:15.980" style="s2">who said it but a question you answer a</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.150" end="00:18:18.770" style="s2">paradox you live with and this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.980" end="00:18:20.120" style="s2">just having to live with that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.770" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">something I want to talk about Terence</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.120" end="00:18:23.150" style="s2">Mckenna because in high weirdness you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:26.540" style="s2">also covered Terence Mckenna</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.150" end="00:18:28.760" style="s2">he also shares that sense of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.540" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">make sense of this complexity is not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.760" end="00:18:32.059" style="s2">way to do it you know I think he has</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:34.670" style="s2">this famous phrase have kind of ride the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.059" end="00:18:36.410" style="s2">wave so where does Herod like why did</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.670" end="00:18:37.640" style="s2">you choose Terence Mckenna to include</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.410" end="00:18:39.559" style="s2">with those three thinkers because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.640" end="00:18:42.170" style="s2">Robert Anton Wilson philip k dick pants</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.559" end="00:18:43.550" style="s2">mckenna so so why x McKenna and who was</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.170" end="00:18:46.010" style="s2">he is well friendly yes sir don&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.550" end="00:18:47.929" style="s2">fine I mean now Terence is someone you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.010" end="00:18:49.490" style="s2">know I I knew personally so that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.929" end="00:18:51.860" style="s2">that was interesting to me because in</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.490" end="00:18:53.890" style="s2">the 1990s he became you know quite well</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.860" end="00:18:57.250" style="s2">known in the underground as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.890" end="00:18:59.630" style="s2">rocontour not quite a guru but</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.250" end="00:19:03.980" style="s2">definitely someone that people would</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.630" end="00:19:06.770" style="s2">were inspired by to - especially to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.980" end="00:19:09.350" style="s2">DMT or take ayahuasca or take high-dose</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.770" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">mushrooms so he was sort of a mouthpiece</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.350" end="00:19:14.330" style="s2">for you know he one time he said</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:16.610" style="s2">basically his role was to just give</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.330" end="00:19:19.309" style="s2">permission so he was a very kind of</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.309" end="00:19:24.520" style="s2">seemed to be having a good time and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.550" end="00:19:26.260" style="s2">a good-humoured person who was saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.520" end="00:19:28.690" style="s2">you know check this stuff out like if</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.260" end="00:19:31.210" style="s2">this has any validity don&#39;t listen to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.690" end="00:19:34.420" style="s2">you know go out there and do it yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.210" end="00:19:37.900" style="s2">and so he was really you know the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.420" end="00:19:39.910" style="s2">colorful and sort of verbally creatively</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.900" end="00:19:42.580" style="s2">interesting thinker in the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:53.410" style="s2">2000 and then the other so that was why</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.430" end="00:19:55.990" style="s2">just was very interested in him and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.410" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">he hasn&#39;t gotten a lot of you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.990" end="00:20:00.040" style="s2">of serious treatment of his life I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:01.930" style="s2">my book is based on a dissertation so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.040" end="00:20:03.460" style="s2">was actually getting a degree but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.930" end="00:20:05.740" style="s2">know thinking hard about these guys that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.460" end="00:20:07.870" style="s2">usually people don&#39;t think about very</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.740" end="00:20:10.900" style="s2">much at all and then I turned it into a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.870" end="00:20:12.220" style="s2">more accessible book but I wanted to see</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.900" end="00:20:15.670" style="s2">what happened when he thought I thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.220" end="00:20:19.060" style="s2">hard about these guys the other reason</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.670" end="00:20:21.580" style="s2">was just that what Pat would which with</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.060" end="00:20:23.190" style="s2">these three figures all share is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.580" end="00:20:25.780" style="s2">they all have these extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.190" end="00:20:28.750" style="s2">experience life-changing experiences in</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.780" end="00:20:31.930" style="s2">the early 70s these like more than just</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.750" end="00:20:34.600" style="s2">a normal trip like something lasts</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.930" end="00:20:36.670" style="s2">longer too long and you got to get out</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.600" end="00:20:38.740" style="s2">or you got to embrace it or you got to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.670" end="00:20:42.210" style="s2">integrate it or whatever so I already</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.740" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">mentioned Wilson&#39;s serious transmissions</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.210" end="00:20:49.000" style="s2">and and philip k dick really around the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:52.210" style="s2">same time had this experience he usually</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.000" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">called to 374 in which he encounters</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.210" end="00:20:57.250" style="s2">this extraterrestrial force that is sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:59.230" style="s2">of you know healing him from the fallen</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.250" end="00:21:01.420" style="s2">world and then it ishi AIT&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.230" end="00:21:03.910" style="s2">series of dreams and synchronicities and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.420" end="00:21:05.230" style="s2">paranormal things that he writes about</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.910" end="00:21:08.050" style="s2">and thinks about for the rest of his</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.230" end="00:21:10.540" style="s2">life it&#39;s really the last his the last</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.050" end="00:21:12.670" style="s2">you know eight years of his life has</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.540" end="00:21:15.100" style="s2">sort of dominated by this experience and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.670" end="00:21:17.880" style="s2">then his Harris&#39;s case he and Dennis</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.100" end="00:21:20.260" style="s2">went down to the Colombian jungle from</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.880" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">in Terence had been in Berkeley before</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.260" end="00:21:27.430" style="s2">and then abroad and they had this epic</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:29.020" style="s2">mushroom experience called the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.430" end="00:21:31.060" style="s2">experiment at Launcher era and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.020" end="00:21:31.370" style="s2">like the core story of his life you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.060" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.370" end="00:21:35.420" style="s2">later wrote a book true the loose</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.190" style="s2">Nations his brother wrote a book they</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.420" end="00:21:39.559" style="s2">also wrote a book together that came out</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.190" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">of their their visions here and it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.559" end="00:21:43.010" style="s2">again when you read the trip it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:45.470" style="s2">normal trip something happened they went</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.010" end="00:21:50.330" style="s2">they got at the very least they oh they</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.470" end="00:21:53.570" style="s2">cook they cracked in some way but but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.330" end="00:21:55.880" style="s2">had more you know it had more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.570" end="00:21:58.190" style="s2">pattern to it than a mere psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.880" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">episode so it becomes a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.190" end="00:22:03.559" style="s2">thing to think about and all three of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:05.750" style="s2">these experiences were similar in</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.559" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">certain ways different in other ways and</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.750" end="00:22:10.100" style="s2">they all eventually saw the similarities</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.870" style="s2">like Terence Mckenna was like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.100" end="00:22:13.700" style="s2">experience was like philip k dick and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.870" end="00:22:15.320" style="s2">Wilson was like my experience was kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.700" end="00:22:17.480" style="s2">of like located kind of not and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.320" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">refer to the Wilson&#39;s and you know so it</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.480" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">was there there was a shared sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:22.970" style="s2">here and so when it would it made me</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.800" style="s2">wonder I was like what what are these</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.970" end="00:22:26.750" style="s2">similarities about what&#39;s going on why</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.800" end="00:22:28.210" style="s2">why are these elements there you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.750" end="00:22:31.630" style="s2">there&#39;s an element of science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.210" end="00:22:34.280" style="s2">breakdown a fact and fiction heavy</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.630" end="00:22:36.500" style="s2">synchronicity some stuff that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.280" end="00:22:38.390" style="s2">traditional religious experience or</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.500" end="00:22:40.070" style="s2">mystical experience but then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.390" end="00:22:41.809" style="s2">stuff that doesn&#39;t look like traditional</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.070" end="00:22:44.360" style="s2">religious experience and like what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.809" end="00:22:46.370" style="s2">that mix about and so I&#39;m really just</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.360" end="00:22:49.040" style="s2">interested in going why why is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.370" end="00:22:50.920" style="s2">going on and so some of the answers are</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.040" end="00:22:53.270" style="s2">historical they&#39;re kind of come from</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.920" end="00:22:55.550" style="s2">similar backgrounds or they have similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.270" end="00:22:57.410" style="s2">influences but I also think it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.550" end="00:22:59.260" style="s2">with the time with what was actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.410" end="00:23:03.170" style="s2">happening historically even</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.260" end="00:23:05.090" style="s2">technologically in the early 1970s which</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.170" end="00:23:07.370" style="s2">to my mind is really the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.090" end="00:23:10.210" style="s2">kind of our era like the where the era</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.370" end="00:23:13.880" style="s2">that we&#39;re at this kind of unraveling</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.210" end="00:23:15.920" style="s2">intensification mixed with a pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.880" end="00:23:17.690" style="s2">banality that we don&#39;t really know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.920" end="00:23:22.100" style="s2">to do with it&#39;s a - it&#39;s a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.690" end="00:23:24.740" style="s2">it&#39;s like this banal apocalypse that a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.100" end="00:23:27.559" style="s2">lot of the technological and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.740" end="00:23:31.090" style="s2">and even economic trends that set that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.559" end="00:23:33.800" style="s2">up really come out of the post sixties</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.090" end="00:23:36.580" style="s2">experiment and experience so they all</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.800" end="00:23:39.190" style="s2">are ways of kind of grappling with where</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.580" end="00:23:40.809" style="s2">we are now in Terrence and that one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:43.299" style="s2">the things that all three of them shared</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.809" end="00:23:45.750" style="s2">to get back to our the main topic of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.299" end="00:23:48.279" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.750" end="00:23:50.710" style="s2">skepticism a certain kind of willingness</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.279" end="00:23:54.250" style="s2">to be in ambivalence and ambiguity a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.710" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">definite commitment to inquiry maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.250" end="00:23:58.630" style="s2">in the specific form but in the larger</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:24:01.500" style="s2">sense that you&#39;d specially Dickie just</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.630" end="00:24:03.909" style="s2">kept asking questions you know almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.500" end="00:24:05.950" style="s2">pathologically like compulsively he</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.909" end="00:24:08.200" style="s2">would I would answer his question what</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.950" end="00:24:09.970" style="s2">happened to me he&#39;d create an answer and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.200" end="00:24:12.279" style="s2">then he&#39;d immediately break it down and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.970" end="00:24:14.950" style="s2">start again as if he he needed to keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.279" end="00:24:17.860" style="s2">asking the question and this was after</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.950" end="00:24:20.260" style="s2">all the era of the seeker and what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.860" end="00:24:23.169" style="s2">the the seeker the seeker is the person</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.240" end="00:26:03.800" style="s2">great things in that list and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.910" end="00:26:05.450" style="s2">one of the challenges of our moment I</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.800" end="00:26:08.150" style="s2">believe is the way in which things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.450" end="00:26:11.450" style="s2">are genuine goods are deeply bound up</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.150" end="00:26:15.950" style="s2">with things that are less good and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.450" end="00:26:18.820" style="s2">don&#39;t always see them so for me that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.950" end="00:26:21.860" style="s2">a little too similar to the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.820" end="00:26:24.170" style="s2">that aspect of meditation or that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.860" end="00:26:26.840" style="s2">of spiritual work which does turn back</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.170" end="00:26:28.580" style="s2">to the self and recognizes that their</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.840" end="00:26:30.770" style="s2">self is sort of responsible for its</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.580" end="00:26:34.450" style="s2">conditions in some ways and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.770" end="00:26:36.740" style="s2">do practices and and take on</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.450" end="00:26:39.560" style="s2">responsibilities that enable you to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.740" end="00:26:41.900" style="s2">able to be more flexible stronger more</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.560" end="00:26:44.240" style="s2">integrated less reactive less depressed</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.900" end="00:26:46.130" style="s2">all those things which are great things</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:49.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve done this stuff I buy this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.130" end="00:26:52.520" style="s2">partly my life is to do these things but</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.430" end="00:26:55.160" style="s2">I think that that it&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.520" end="00:26:56.930" style="s2">important vitally important now to along</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.160" end="00:26:59.810" style="s2">with that and this is where something</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.930" end="00:27:03.650" style="s2">like inquiry I think allows for is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.810" end="00:27:06.830" style="s2">along with that kind of inner work is we</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.650" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">we need two things one is that an even</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.830" end="00:27:12.920" style="s2">more commit you know stronger commitment</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:14.300" style="s2">to a certain kind of if not intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.920" end="00:27:18.170" style="s2">then at least kind of critical</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.300" end="00:27:20.510" style="s2">questioning the part of inquiry is also</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.170" end="00:27:24.050" style="s2">questioning in the deep sense which</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.510" end="00:27:25.750" style="s2">means like questioning the the value of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.050" end="00:27:27.830" style="s2">the systems that I&#39;m operating in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.750" end="00:27:30.050" style="s2">questioning the values that seem very</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.830" end="00:27:32.060" style="s2">positive to me like you know the value</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.050" end="00:27:35.210" style="s2">of flexibility you&#39;re like flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.060" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">interesting was who&#39;s who&#39;s who really</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.210" end="00:27:40.220" style="s2">gets flexibility well it&#39;s the you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.480" end="00:27:41.720" style="s2">the gig economy definitely wants</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.220" end="00:27:43.670" style="s2">flexibility out of me you know my</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.720" end="00:27:46.340" style="s2">ability to like constantly find any</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.670" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">opportunity to work or to no longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.340" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">believe that I deserve some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:53.000" style="s2">consistent job or consistent you know -</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:55.670" style="s2">no no I have to be more flexible and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.000" end="00:27:58.160" style="s2">open that may be the best value for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.670" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">to actually emulate but it&#39;s a two-edged</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.160" end="00:28:04.680" style="s2">sword and if we don&#39;t acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:07.050" style="s2">we&#39;re really losing part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.680" end="00:28:11.040" style="s2">should be generating in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.050" end="00:28:12.540" style="s2">capacity to stay awake even if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.040" end="00:28:14.190" style="s2">ultimately change a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.540" end="00:28:16.860" style="s2">conditions very well and I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.190" end="00:28:19.470" style="s2">think we could but even if we can&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.860" end="00:28:21.390" style="s2">at the very least we need to stay awake</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.470" end="00:28:23.370" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a great description what</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.390" end="00:28:25.050" style="s2">comes to mind is when I was I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.370" end="00:28:27.740" style="s2">longer teaching meditation as much I</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.050" end="00:28:29.790" style="s2">used to have a studio and teach and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.740" end="00:28:31.710" style="s2">increasingly was feeling that this kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.790" end="00:28:33.720" style="s2">of sense of mindfulness it&#39;s been cold</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.710" end="00:28:34.920" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of commodification of and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.720" end="00:28:37.650" style="s2">it&#39;s happening with psychedelics as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.920" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">I think you know this is this this sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.650" end="00:28:40.920" style="s2">of stripping the spirit out of it and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:42.810" style="s2">remember one time getting a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.920" end="00:28:44.340" style="s2">frustrated and saying to a group you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.810" end="00:28:45.480" style="s2">know of whatever ten people sitting</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.340" end="00:28:46.680" style="s2">there I was like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.480" end="00:28:48.330" style="s2">ultimately meditation is about learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.680" end="00:28:50.160" style="s2">how to die before you die this is all</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.330" end="00:28:51.870" style="s2">about death we have to connect with debt</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.160" end="00:28:53.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s really at least a part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:56.100" style="s2">liberation and it went down like a lead</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.370" end="00:28:58.830" style="s2">balloon never did it again because there</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.100" end="00:29:00.030" style="s2">was a sense of whoa too real but for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.830" end="00:29:01.500" style="s2">you know I&#39;m interested to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.030" end="00:29:02.460" style="s2">thoughts on this that you mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.500" end="00:29:05.040" style="s2">kind of at the beginning is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.460" end="00:29:06.990" style="s2">commodification of of the esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.040" end="00:29:09.480" style="s2">commodification of psychedelics you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.990" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">it seems to be when it gets subsumed in</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.480" end="00:29:12.840" style="s2">the culture it&#39;s something and it dies</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:15.450" style="s2">or does it I don&#39;t know maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.840" end="00:29:16.920" style="s2">some trace of it left over well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.450" end="00:29:19.110" style="s2">hard to know about the trace of it left</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.920" end="00:29:20.850" style="s2">over you know sometimes you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.110" end="00:29:23.340" style="s2">depending on the day sometimes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.850" end="00:29:25.770" style="s2">incredibly disappointed and angry about</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.340" end="00:29:29.400" style="s2">the commodification and popularization</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.770" end="00:29:31.530" style="s2">of meditation and psychedelics and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.400" end="00:29:33.420" style="s2">the other days I&#39;m like well it just it</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.530" end="00:29:36.060" style="s2">shows that people recognize that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.420" end="00:29:38.430" style="s2">kind of powerful and transformative and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.060" end="00:29:40.950" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be that crass side of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.430" end="00:29:45.540" style="s2">it and some of those people who come</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.950" end="00:29:46.890" style="s2">into it for coarse reasons will have</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.540" end="00:29:49.410" style="s2">something happened to them and then they</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.890" end="00:29:51.300" style="s2">they can&#39;t help but go forward in ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.410" end="00:29:53.350" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t even want to and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.300" end="00:29:55.870" style="s2">might even end up going I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.350" end="00:29:58.029" style="s2">I can&#39;t work at this job anymore or I</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.870" end="00:29:59.830" style="s2">can&#39;t stop thinking about death I got to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.029" end="00:30:02.440" style="s2">deal with the death thing like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.830" end="00:30:06.009" style="s2">no way out I gotta get get on the you</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.440" end="00:30:08.740" style="s2">know on the horse for this one so III</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.009" end="00:30:11.080" style="s2">very you know for me it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.740" end="00:30:12.909" style="s2">continue the conversation that so many</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.080" end="00:30:16.210" style="s2">of us are happening and relatively</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.909" end="00:30:17.980" style="s2">quickly it was it wasn&#39;t that long that</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.210" end="00:30:21.399" style="s2">that mind I mean mindfulness has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.980" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">popular are longer but but and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.399" end="00:30:24.279" style="s2">happening even more quickly with</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:27.070" style="s2">psychedelics where people are starting</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.279" end="00:30:29.470" style="s2">to talk about this problem this problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:32.529" style="s2">of commodification and one way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.470" end="00:30:35.769" style="s2">thinking about it is is again it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.529" end="00:30:37.899" style="s2">it&#39;s overly focuses on the self</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.769" end="00:30:39.879" style="s2">despite the paradox that both of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.899" end="00:30:41.860" style="s2">things done properly reveal that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.879" end="00:30:44.379" style="s2">self is not what you think it is and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.860" end="00:30:46.360" style="s2">fact in many ways is composed of others</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.379" end="00:30:48.669" style="s2">multiple others in us and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.360" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">connections the intimate absolute</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.669" end="00:30:53.169" style="s2">connections we have with everything else</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">so it&#39;s a strange paradox that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.169" end="00:30:58.450" style="s2">requires a kind of a kind of dodge or a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:01.090" style="s2">kind of forgetting like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.450" end="00:31:03.370" style="s2">package the psychedelic or package the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.090" end="00:31:04.899" style="s2">mindfulness in a way that keeps people</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.370" end="00:31:06.940" style="s2">thinking that they are just these</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.899" end="00:31:08.919" style="s2">solitary egos that are responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.940" end="00:31:10.870" style="s2">improving themselves so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.919" end="00:31:13.230" style="s2">form form better in life and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.870" end="00:31:15.639" style="s2">hide the way that there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.230" end="00:31:17.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong potential that these</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.639" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">things can also make you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:21.309" style="s2">you are profoundly you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.450" end="00:31:23.590" style="s2">interconnected not even just in the like</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.309" end="00:31:25.980" style="s2">I&#39;m one with the universe way which to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.590" end="00:31:29.080" style="s2">my mind is actually not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.980" end="00:31:32.169" style="s2">always the most politically helpful but</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.080" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">more like I&#39;m in this room I&#39;m connected</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.169" end="00:31:36.580" style="s2">to my ancestors I&#39;m connected to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.470" style="s2">know these experiences that I have my</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.580" end="00:31:39.549" style="s2">from the place that I am from the plants</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.470" end="00:31:41.559" style="s2">that are in the room from the bird</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.549" end="00:31:44.529" style="s2">that&#39;s singing right now that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.559" end="00:31:46.750" style="s2">being intimately woven into the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.529" end="00:31:48.730" style="s2">and that was the second point where I</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.750" end="00:31:52.539" style="s2">was saying that to to kind of balance</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.730" end="00:31:54.850" style="s2">out the potential capitalist narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.539" end="00:31:56.529" style="s2">of self work you know in the one hand we</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.850" end="00:31:58.149" style="s2">need to be more critical which of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.529" end="00:32:00.970" style="s2">most people aren&#39;t they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.149" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">like to do that but tough we just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.970" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">people who can should continue to do it</p>

<p begin="00:32:15.150" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">that turning within needs to be balanced</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.990" end="00:32:23.910" style="s2">with a new kind of turning without or a</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.160" end="00:33:22.550" style="s2">to some extent and I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.190" end="00:33:24.390" style="s2">a couple reasons that this is a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.550" end="00:33:27.900" style="s2">adjunct or nine teams not even an</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.900" end="00:33:32.760" style="s2">say to this turn without because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:34.890" style="s2">of meditation practices that are like no</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.760" end="00:33:37.530" style="s2">just to either ignore it or just</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.890" end="00:33:39.720" style="s2">recognize it as just a rising and</p>

<p begin="00:33:39.720" end="00:33:45.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think about it I&#39;m like okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.600" end="00:33:47.520" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it but you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.720" end="00:33:48.990" style="s2">my most profound experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.520" end="00:33:51.800" style="s2">illuminating experiences have been</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.990" end="00:33:54.630" style="s2">actually when I&#39;m much more intimately</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.800" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">connected with the phenomena around me</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.630" end="00:33:58.680" style="s2">and the beings around me and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:01.290" style="s2">that one of the reasons I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.680" end="00:34:03.960" style="s2">important is that it balances out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.290" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">potential narcissism with a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:10.530" style="s2">responsibility and connection with</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:13.890" style="s2">actual agents particularly non-human</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.530" end="00:34:14.889" style="s2">ones and you know one of the ways we</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.890" end="00:34:16.359" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.889" end="00:34:20.230" style="s2">environmental condition that we&#39;re in is</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.359" end="00:34:22.659" style="s2">to be painfully aware of the way in</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.230" end="00:34:27.010" style="s2">which we are always woven into these</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.659" end="00:34:30.069" style="s2">larger shifts and enforces good and bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.010" end="00:34:32.309" style="s2">in the in the environment so in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.069" end="00:34:34.569" style="s2">sense becoming very aware that like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.309" end="00:34:35.529" style="s2">every you know every day I&#39;m eating</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.569" end="00:34:37.240" style="s2">plastic</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.529" end="00:34:38.679" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s horrifying I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.240" end="00:34:39.250" style="s2">think about that not much I can do about</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.679" end="00:34:43.210" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.250" end="00:34:46.179" style="s2">and yet by being okay with that which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.210" end="00:34:48.940" style="s2">in a way being okay with dying I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.179" end="00:34:51.549" style="s2">recognize that this is an actual reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.940" end="00:34:53.289" style="s2">that we are all in right now and that if</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.549" end="00:34:56.710" style="s2">there is anything to do about it which</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.289" end="00:34:58.829" style="s2">is not altogether clear to me that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.710" end="00:35:03.099" style="s2">comes through being willing to really</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.829" end="00:35:04.779" style="s2">embrace that sort of gruesome reality so</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.099" end="00:35:09.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an element of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.779" end="00:35:13.809" style="s2">of acceptance of the outside both as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.369" end="00:35:16.510" style="s2">horror and as a realm that&#39;s populated</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.809" end="00:35:20.319" style="s2">with many possible relationships that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.510" end="00:35:22.839" style="s2">think balances out a sort of narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.319" end="00:35:25.269" style="s2">that can be a little you know could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.839" end="00:35:27.730" style="s2">kind of I figured out how to have bliss</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.269" end="00:35:29.500" style="s2">inside myself so I&#39;m not gonna let those</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.730" end="00:35:31.690" style="s2">things bother me anymore I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.500" end="00:35:33.579" style="s2">stay this way and that can be helpful it</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.690" end="00:35:35.470" style="s2">can be Nestle oohed lean esses area</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.579" end="00:35:37.180" style="s2">points in our lives I&#39;m I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.470" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">black-and-white person about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.180" end="00:35:42.250" style="s2">but I think at the point we are now we</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:45.089" style="s2">also need to come up with new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.250" end="00:35:47.559" style="s2">really with wide eyes or open eyes</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.089" end="00:35:49.000" style="s2">connecting with the world around us so</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.559" end="00:35:51.549" style="s2">what you&#39;re just talking about this this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.000" end="00:35:53.529" style="s2">sense resonated me a lot this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.549" end="00:35:55.750" style="s2">the necessity of something beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.529" end="00:35:57.250" style="s2">ego something outside of us and and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.750" end="00:35:59.019" style="s2">I think there is a narcissism and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.250" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">of the inner practices which are simply</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.019" end="00:36:02.980" style="s2">based around self-improvement</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:06.759" style="s2">you know bigger better faster stronger</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.980" end="00:36:08.410" style="s2">so Terence Mckenna talked about he he</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.759" end="00:36:10.119" style="s2">had this phrase that the transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.410" end="00:36:11.829" style="s2">object at the end of time this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.119" end="00:36:14.200" style="s2">strange attractor pulling history</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.829" end="00:36:15.910" style="s2">towards it which is a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.200" end="00:36:17.619" style="s2">concept I&#39;d love to get your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.910" end="00:36:21.039" style="s2">in terms of how it relates right now but</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.619" end="00:36:22.809" style="s2">I very much have the sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.039" end="00:36:24.369" style="s2">death of God Nietzsche&#39;s death of God is</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.809" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">also what we&#39;re living in there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.369" end="00:36:27.970" style="s2">we for the first time don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:30.070" style="s2">something that is coherent</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.970" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">in the West that would kind of draws us</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.070" end="00:36:33.970" style="s2">towards it like there&#39;s a kind of final</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:36.310" style="s2">mystery at the end of things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.970" end="00:36:38.140" style="s2">beyond all of us so how important is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.310" end="00:36:41.350" style="s2">that right now for navigating this kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.140" end="00:36:43.810" style="s2">of crazy crazy world that we&#39;re in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.350" end="00:36:46.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really tough one I</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.810" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">mean just to talk about terrasses idea I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.210" end="00:36:51.310" style="s2">think you&#39;re right you put your finger</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">on it is that even though on the one</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.310" end="00:36:58.510" style="s2">hand it is a crazy idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:37:00.220" style="s2">it is also clearly sort of allegorically</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.510" end="00:37:02.710" style="s2">appropriate to our moment I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.220" end="00:37:06.010" style="s2">start to go like you go Terrence had</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.710" end="00:37:08.200" style="s2">this idea of the time wave that you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.010" end="00:37:10.060" style="s2">sort of understand the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.200" end="00:37:13.390" style="s2">development of his history and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.060" end="00:37:15.280" style="s2">increasing amounts of novelty by finding</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.390" end="00:37:18.970" style="s2">and mathematical object in the II Ching</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">and super crank kooky stuff and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.970" end="00:37:22.690" style="s2">about that in the book it&#39;s like how did</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:23.650" style="s2">he believe why why did he hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.690" end="00:37:25.330" style="s2">this you know it&#39;s this really</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.650" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">invaluable idea doesn&#39;t really hold</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.330" end="00:37:30.100" style="s2">water but from another angle does really</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:32.530" style="s2">matter because he was clearly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.100" end="00:37:34.600" style="s2">articulate something that feels true</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.530" end="00:37:37.450" style="s2">about history this sort of ramping up</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.600" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">the sort of technical technology the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.450" end="00:37:41.320" style="s2">sense that we&#39;re entering these</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">asymptotes and Wilson talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.320" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">too even in the in the early 70s he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.510" end="00:37:46.570" style="s2">saying here we go I mean he would even</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:48.820" style="s2">draw out charts of like intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.570" end="00:37:50.470" style="s2">increase and and you know he believed</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.820" end="00:37:52.150" style="s2">that we were gonna go offworld and like</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.470" end="00:37:53.460" style="s2">so there was all three of the guys were</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.150" end="00:37:54.850" style="s2">very there they were not</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.460" end="00:37:56.980" style="s2">back-to-the-landers they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.850" end="00:37:59.260" style="s2">transhumanist they were looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.980" end="00:38:01.540" style="s2">and through and up was there kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.260" end="00:38:04.420" style="s2">their kind of attitude in in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.540" end="00:38:07.690" style="s2">different ways but now we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.420" end="00:38:11.560" style="s2">situation where the the if the secular</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.690" end="00:38:13.690" style="s2">idea of progress once held that place we</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.560" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">we nobody really believes that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.690" end="00:38:18.820" style="s2">and if the people do it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">at the very least naive and often kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.820" end="00:38:23.980" style="s2">of pernicious I mean Silicon Valley</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.960" end="00:39:17.450" style="s2">but in a way Terence found a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.770" end="00:39:38.690" style="s2">phenomenology of psychedelics at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.770" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">for some kinds of people I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.690" end="00:39:44.690" style="s2">this for everywhere but I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:46.670" style="s2">are people like me and I suspect you and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.690" end="00:39:48.440" style="s2">Terence where you read a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.670" end="00:39:49.820" style="s2">you know a lot about history you know a</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.280" end="00:40:02.990" style="s2">sort of like intensifies and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.220" end="00:40:04.700" style="s2">reaches like a breaking point and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.990" end="00:40:06.470" style="s2">have that and because the time the sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.700" end="00:40:09.140" style="s2">of time and psychedelics is so different</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.470" end="00:40:12.740" style="s2">than our ordinary sense of time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.140" end="00:40:15.410" style="s2">a great phrase that the scholar Hansie</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.740" end="00:40:17.420" style="s2">Onis had writing about the early</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.410" end="00:40:19.810" style="s2">Gnostics in the in the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.420" end="00:40:23.420" style="s2">where he says that the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.810" end="00:40:26.510" style="s2">internalized eschatology that means they</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.420" end="00:40:28.520" style="s2">take the end of time which is usually</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.510" end="00:40:30.890" style="s2">thought of as a historical event and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.520" end="00:40:34.430" style="s2">they internalize it they experience it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.890" end="00:40:36.109" style="s2">themselves and in a way psychedelics let</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.430" end="00:40:38.119" style="s2">you or sometimes without you even</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.109" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">wanting to do that so you have an</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.119" end="00:40:41.670" style="s2">apocalyptic scenario or you become a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:44.190" style="s2">messiah at the end</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.670" end="00:40:46.470" style="s2">or your Christ on the cross or some kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.190" end="00:40:48.660" style="s2">of apocalyptic event where it all comes</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.470" end="00:40:50.460" style="s2">together that&#39;s also just sort of part</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.660" end="00:40:53.510" style="s2">of the phenomenology of it at least for</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.460" end="00:40:55.770" style="s2">historically aware you know human beings</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.510" end="00:40:57.180" style="s2">so what do we do if we don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.770" end="00:40:59.099" style="s2">things I can sort of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.180" end="00:41:02.910" style="s2">what do we we don&#39;t have a progress we</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.099" end="00:41:05.960" style="s2">don&#39;t have a God we don&#39;t have some you</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.460" end="00:41:26.460" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of true and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.510" end="00:41:30.750" style="s2">when people are interested I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.460" end="00:41:33.480" style="s2">like pull them in but at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.750" end="00:41:35.400" style="s2">do recognize that that the minute you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.480" end="00:41:38.309" style="s2">really turn those into some kind of mass</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.400" end="00:41:40.920" style="s2">concept the same crappy stuff starts to</p>

<p begin="00:42:46.410" end="00:42:50.339" style="s2">that&#39;s a real question we opt out</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.910" end="00:42:51.510" style="s2">like how we&#39;re out here you know when</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.339" end="00:42:53.700" style="s2">during about the construction of reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.510" end="00:42:56.520" style="s2">and doing our breathing or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.700" end="00:42:58.230" style="s2">meanwhile down the road is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.520" end="00:43:00.180" style="s2">all these cultural systems are being</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.230" end="00:43:02.730" style="s2">weaponized and they&#39;re resonating with</p>

<p begin="00:43:02.730" end="00:43:06.660" style="s2">in much more simple terms to the same</p>

<p begin="00:43:11.069" end="00:43:16.140" style="s2">it&#39;s probably getting worse and so how</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.900" end="00:43:18.289" style="s2">do we build a just a life a culture a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.140" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">way of dealing with the multiplicity of</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.859" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">you know I think there&#39;s a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.240" end="00:43:40.710" style="s2">concrete fights to fight that are that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:44.220" style="s2">are intrinsically valuable but I suspect</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.589" end="00:44:21.240" style="s2">incredibly toxic for the most part is</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.599" end="00:44:22.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like whatever it&#39;s good for or bad</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.309" end="00:44:46.589" style="s2">the 90s and there were always flame wars</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.319" end="00:44:49.079" style="s2">but things are much much more massif I&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:44:49.079" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">and anyway there&#39;s a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.609" end="00:44:54.900" style="s2">with it but one of the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:56.930" style="s2">it does is that it it prevents largely</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.900" end="00:44:59.450" style="s2">prevents people or</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.930" end="00:45:03.610" style="s2">or it pushes against people&#39;s capacity</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.450" end="00:45:07.100" style="s2">to build friend networks that have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.610" end="00:45:09.860" style="s2">intimate peer-to-peer you know we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.100" end="00:45:12.470" style="s2">on this leaky boat together bailing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.860" end="00:45:15.350" style="s2">water together and made that may be it</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.470" end="00:45:19.040" style="s2">and our ability to really enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.350" end="00:45:21.230" style="s2">camaraderie of that to affirm love and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.040" end="00:45:24.230" style="s2">connection in the midst of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.230" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">rather than taking political positions</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.230" end="00:45:28.580" style="s2">and judging people whether or not they</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:33.500" style="s2">pass a certain thing and that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.580" end="00:45:35.450" style="s2">kind of false overly social social sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.500" end="00:45:37.490" style="s2">of connection which we you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.450" end="00:45:39.980" style="s2">also part of these larger social bodies</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.490" end="00:45:41.930" style="s2">but it&#39;s like sociology run amok it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.980" end="00:45:43.430" style="s2">like people just just acting and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.930" end="00:45:46.250" style="s2">thinking in terms of like these large</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.430" end="00:45:48.520" style="s2">socio sociological blocks where I want</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.250" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">something that&#39;s more like friendship</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.520" end="00:45:52.790" style="s2">spiritual friendships peer to peer</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:55.160" style="s2">French uh peer to peer spirituality what</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.790" end="00:45:57.170" style="s2">we&#39;re like we all know we don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.160" end="00:45:58.430" style="s2">I know a little bit here or I can inform</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.170" end="00:46:00.740" style="s2">you here or you&#39;re having a tough time</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.430" end="00:46:03.260" style="s2">let&#39;s bring this together and that&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.740" end="00:46:05.150" style="s2">be networks of friends that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.260" end="00:46:07.550" style="s2">in the real physical space together it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.150" end="00:46:10.340" style="s2">can be far-flung but it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.550" end="00:46:15.290" style="s2">mediated through the intense social</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.340" end="00:46:18.410" style="s2">performance and masking and kind of meme</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.290" end="00:46:20.290" style="s2">driven things as social media so you</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.410" end="00:46:22.670" style="s2">know that&#39;s something that I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.290" end="00:46:26.870" style="s2">concrete thing that people can do and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.670" end="00:46:29.000" style="s2">should do in terms of if they can of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.870" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">their you know building a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.000" end="00:46:34.580" style="s2">existential social ballast in their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:36.920" style="s2">lives seems like a really natural place</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.580" end="00:46:38.570" style="s2">to stop it was really lovely nicely said</p>
