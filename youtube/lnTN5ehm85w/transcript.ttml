<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">pleasure of uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">meeting each other at a conference uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">which we were talking about just before</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">and um uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">i would like to sort of pick up maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">from that as a common point</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">and uh just quickly review where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">coming from and where i&#39;m coming at and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">um how i&#39;ve come to your work and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">what role i see with it within my my</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">and then maybe turn things over to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">so maybe give me like 10 minutes to sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">of riff for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d love i&#39;d love to hear it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">uh the work i do as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">sort of science i do as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">scientist is to work on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">a very core problem uh which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">a a a problem that needs to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">at the core of our ability to categorize</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">to communicate to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">um to perform inferences i won&#39;t repeat</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">those arguments</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">they&#39;re available at length and you you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">saw a version of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">that the central process is the process</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">that i call relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">which is the right the ability to zero</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">in on relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">and you&#39;re doing that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">avoids either an algorithmic search of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">all possible information</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">which is combinatorial explosive and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">impossible or just</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">merely being arbitrary and just randomly</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">picking</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">so somehow we we steer between the skill</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">and charybdis</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">of algorithmic totality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">arbitrary you know finitude you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">just a finite</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">arbitrary partiality is a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">putting it and somehow we</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">we reliably zero in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">information and then some of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">information enters our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">experience and becomes salient to us</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">etc and i think this is very central to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">uh to um cognition and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">the argument is that the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">we sort of do relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">is deeply analogous um to the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">evolution works in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">evolution is a process by which um</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">there&#39;s variation</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">and then there&#39;s selection put on it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">that sort of reconfigures things from</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">which new variation is generated</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">selection is put on it and you you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">this sort of accordion</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">and then a self-organizing system</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">revolves with change or it evolves and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">then the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">your brain is doing exactly that your</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">brain is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">introducing variation to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">more options for itself it doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">to get locked down into having no</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">options</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">so it opens up variations but it also</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">wants to be efficient in its in its use</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">of its resources so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly doing this and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">constantly evolving</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">it&#39;s fittedness to the environment and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">use that analogy analogous to biological</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">the biological fittedness of an organism</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">and then the and the idea here is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">no definition of fittedness in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">that there is no essential features</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">shared by all all</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">creatures that are fit you know uh some</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">are big some are small some are tall</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">some are short some are hard servers</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">etc right all that all the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">that&#39;s required is that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">keep the they keep the process of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">going itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">and so there is no definition</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:19.199" style="s2">uh to bitterness and one of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">part of the genius of darwin is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.199" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">he gave up the attempt of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">naturalists um you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">the in the sense of the uh the clergymen</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:29.919" style="s2">who were going out trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">determine the definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.919" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">perfection of things so they could know</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">the mind of god instead he gave up</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">trying to find such an essence and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">instead proposed</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">a universal process by which fittedness</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">is constantly redefining itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:46.639" style="s2">and restructuring itself and i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">what&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.639" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">is similarly evolving and constantly</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">redefining and restructuring itself so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">there is no</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">essence to relevance also i mean what</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">you find relevant</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">one minute will not be relevant the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">minute um of all the there&#39;s not no</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">property that all the things you find</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">relevant share</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">other than you find them relevant etc</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">and so i think there is in that sense no</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">essence and therefore no perfectability</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">and i use this term deliberately final</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">solution to relevance there isn&#39;t a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">of saying it now</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">we&#39;re done it&#39;s finished now why this</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.520" style="s2">matters existentially and here&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2">i&#39;m taking off my hat as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.520" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">scientist and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">putting on a different hat</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">is that i think for various historical</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:35.600" style="s2">and structural reasons</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s i think very ample evidence</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.600" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">for it our current</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">culture is going through what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">called the meeting crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">people are this is not a dearth of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">semantic meaning that&#39;s not what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about the kind of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">that psychologists talk about when they</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">talk about meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">uh meaning in life is the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">your life is worth living</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">that there is a sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:03.199" style="s2">to oneself</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">and to each other and to the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.199" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">that makes the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">worthwhile in some fashion</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">research about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">is that meaning in life in fact is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">primarily about possession</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">or even a sense of contentedness in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">subjective well-being are measures of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">contentedness and meaning in life can go</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:32.319" style="s2">in different directions</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">my primary and good example of this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.319" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">having a child</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">when you have a child all the measures</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">of subjective well-being go down you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">frustrated you&#39;re tired you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">you&#39;re uncertain about the blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">blah but why do people have children</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">then well because their meeting in life</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">up well what is it about that well it</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s that sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">especially the sense of mattering</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:56.160" style="s2">the sense of being connected to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">something that is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">one&#39;s egocentrically specific concerns</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">and what how i put these two together is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">the argument</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">meaning in life is about is about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">phenomenological sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">of the connectedness that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">what is being constantly</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">produced by relevance realization i so i</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">use the bridging term religio to cover</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">that religious</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">sense of being connected and we know why</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">we want to be connected we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:32.640" style="s2">connected because</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">if we aren&#39;t connected if we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.640" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">doing relevance realization and creating</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">affordances</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">we&#39;re not any kind of cognitive agent</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to suffer a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">or we&#39;re going to suffer the death of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">arbitrary chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">cognition and so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">human beings have created ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">what i call serious play which might put</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">two of you turns uh in opposition but</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">maybe we can negotiate that</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">what i mean by that is play that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">are willing to deeply commit themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">uh precisely because what they want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">play with and play in that evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">the connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">precisely because there is no way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">finish it</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">finalize it uh perfect it and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">i think uh humans have created</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">many things that whose sole purpose</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">draw into awareness to give us access</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">and to accentuate um our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">and to play with it so that we may</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">enhance it</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">you know poetry and music are ways of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">just playing</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">with our relevance realization machinery</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">but i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">what has been lost in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">are ways in which human beings</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">have been guided in how they play so</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">i&#39;ll make one final point and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">turn things over to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:05.279" style="s2">the the that very process by which we</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">are adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">intelligent that self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">that that self-organizing dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">coupling</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">is also the very same process by which</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">human beings fall into self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">so the very relevance realization that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">prevents us from</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">having to check all the information can</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">also misfire and bias us</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">and prejudice us in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">important and self-destructive ways so</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">cultures have perennially</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">come up with practices that are designed</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">to try and address and alleviate that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">self-deception on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">and enhance the religio on another in</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">some kind of coordinated fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">and then i think and i&#39;ve done work on</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">this we published a consensus paper on</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">it in psych inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">i think the the most common term across</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">cultures and time for that is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">and i think wisdom is very different</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">from knowledge i think wisdom is a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">to enhance religio enhance relevance</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">realization by ameliorating</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:10.480" style="s2">and by affording enhanced senses of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.480" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">what we&#39;ve lost historically is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">lost</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">a world view and a tradition and a set</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">institutions and guides and practices</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">for the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">so i often do this with people in groups</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">i&#39;ll say where do you go for information</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">they have a ready answer the internet</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">uh where do you go for knowledge they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">still pretty much say science</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">and then when i say where do you go for</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">wisdom and there&#39;s a deafening silence</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">and because of that what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">often feel very bereft about how</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">to deal with these perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">that undermine religio</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">and undermine their capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">is that we have confused we&#39;ve confused</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">propositions</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">and belief systems with</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">the very like we&#39;ve we&#39;ve reduced</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">of meaning making and so what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">tried to do is we&#39;ve tried to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">ideological replacements uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">for that i think um and i i saw</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">something very analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">the critique i&#39;m now making in your book</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">the religious case against belief</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">that what we try to do is create these</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">structures that totalize perfect and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">complete</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">um when when what we in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">what religion is doing is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">moving um our response to mystery</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">the the fact that we can&#39;t complete this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">it&#39;s open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">etc and so i think another aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">meeting crisis and this is what peter</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">does a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">is that people try to create sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">pseudo-religious</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">ideologies and political structures</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">that attempt</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">in sets of statements that are designed</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">what i think is need and what and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">primary form of discourse is out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">adversarial debate</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">because the point and here&#39;s again your</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">the point is to defeat the other side</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">so that there you&#39;re now entitled to be</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">and not have to take up ever again the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.920" end="00:13:58.320" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to work into</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.320" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">and work with many other people peter</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">included this environment included</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">towards a way of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:08.959" style="s2">that gives prominence to religio rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.959" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">credo and that is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">get people to come into right</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">relationship with religio and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">continually evolve</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">their capacities for relevance</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">realization cultivate wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">as opposed to trying to come to some</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:28.880" style="s2">final conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where i see your work on</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.880" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">infinite and finite games</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">uh directly relevant um if we could the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">game of discourse</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">and so i&#39;m thinking of habermas here i</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">think is a clear example of what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">we often pretend that it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a necessity but we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s always been constructed by mutual</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">agreement and the thing is do we want</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">the game of gift discourse to be finite</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">games that seek perfection and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:54.480" style="s2">completion</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">and talk in propositional closure</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">or do we want forms of discourse that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">afford that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">right that continuing evolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">uh so they they promote a continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">contact</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">with a constantly changing environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">that are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">to use your language moving the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">and so that&#39;s how i sorry that was me</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">trying to compress a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">thinking into a very short time and try</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">to show you connections i see between my</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">work and your work</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">john this is a very rich material</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s lovely beautiful i love it i</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.600" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">i&#39;ve been doing some work lately um</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">believe it or not</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">on economic theory but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">i wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">in that was go back and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">intellectual roots of our thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">the way we think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">uh money in society and and that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">kind of thing and so i&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">i i went back to uh plato and aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.639" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">and um the uh i you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">of course i read them thoroughly in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">uh some of them in greek even that was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">bit of a job but</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">you know i did yeah but then um and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">uh read them on and off over the years</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">but but</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">now more recently looking at them you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">any anytime i go back to the greeks i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">always surprised by finding something</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">i didn&#39;t realize was quite there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">you&#39;re talking i&#39;m thinking uh when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">talk you talk about uh engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">discussion disc</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">you use the word discourse um</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">i i was surprised to read in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">commentary</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">that plato invented discourse</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t think that right but but i</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">invented the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">a dialogue never occurred in uh in</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">in human literature uh before uh before</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">plato and what happens in a dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">really interesting and very</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">relevant to what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">yes i used the word dialectically</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">but but and but usually translated</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">but i&#39;m going to use the word dielectric</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">because it it does</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a slightly different um it gives it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">a little more gravity i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">yep i agree um but the but what happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">if you you talk you you make the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">distinction between wisdom and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">in uh in the uh dialogue called uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">theaters socrates runs into this young</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">a mathematician actually he&#39;s a geometer</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">and uh someone introduces him</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">and then socrates looks at the young man</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">he&#39;s a young guy</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">and he sees that he has an ugly face</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">he&#39;s a very ugly young man</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">but socrates was hugely ugly in himself</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">famously ugly and so he said i see</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">we share something in common he said</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">the young man he starts off that way and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">he said i want to see if we</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:26.160" style="s2">talk he said what do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">do the man said i&#39;m a g i do geometry he</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:29.919" style="s2">now tell me i i don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.919" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">wisdom and knowledge socrates said</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">and the young man he said can you tell</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">me what knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">and he said oh yes we we learn this we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">learn how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">a plumber has a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">knowledge and so on and socrates says</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">now wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the use of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">knowledge i want to know what knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">is and that becomes much more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">and of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">unanswerable and then then we begin to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">see that the dealer</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.640" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">then actually then he he makes it really</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">surprising it&#39;s a great uh dialogue by</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">by the way theater fun to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">read again</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">and he says you probably have heard</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">socrates said</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">that i was born by way of a midwife</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">and uh the young man said no i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">and he and then socrates makes this</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">amazing remark</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">i have taken up the art of midwifery</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">intellectual midwifery he said i</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">help people bring ideas into</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">birth if they&#39;re not well conceived they</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">need someone to help them</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">on the other hand i can&#39;t do it myself</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">i&#39;m sterile i need you to bring my</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:51.520" style="s2">wisdom and my knowledge into uh into</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">birth</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.520" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">and so what he does is establish in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">dialectically the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">an ongoing discussion and we find out at</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">by the way that this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.559" end="00:20:07.360" style="s2">the last dialogue socrates has before he</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.559" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.360" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">at the end of the dialogue he goes right</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">into the jury in athens</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">who condemn him to death about an hour</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">later after he finishes his dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">and um but but that but the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">never ends</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">that&#39;s right and and so what you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">what you&#39;re getting at</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">is this open-ended conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">that goes on</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">and then i want to add something to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">i i i would love to i could spend hours</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">on this stuff you&#39;ll have to slow me</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">down maybe but but aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">aristotle&#39;s interesting and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">different than uh socrates and plato in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">a number of ways but in one one</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">important way</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">he sees like in the way you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">he sees our involvement as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">profoundly social that is we we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">engaged as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">so that that our well-being is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">always a well like you use the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">example of the family</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">so you you you can&#39;t be happy as an</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">aristotle&#39;s famous uh remark is that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">purpose of life is is is to become happy</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">you you die monia he called it uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">actually that&#39;s a very bad translation</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">of eudaimonia but</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">it means something more like well-being</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">the way you talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">yeah and but the the basic insight in</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">aristotle is that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">are social beings our primary</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">relationship is to those around us</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">and therefore all of our knowledge our</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">wisdom and so on</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">is is a wisdom is a communal wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">knowledge is something we have with each</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">other not something i have</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">myself and and with wisdom uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">as well of course it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">the discussion about what wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">really has never been answered it still</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">goes on right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">plato plato didn&#39;t get an answer and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">don&#39;t have one either exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">except what you&#39;re getting at is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">ongoing yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">uh the the the the con</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.080" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">wittgenstein uh said</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">that the meaning of language is not what</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">it stands for</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">but what comes of it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">i i want to i want to say the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">a word is what comes of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">and a meaningful life is one that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">something comes of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">with others i i that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">uh my own personal view and that that i</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">think is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">is is buried in what i&#39;ve tried to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">in finite and infinite games that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got a we are competitive</p>

<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">but together we are we are in a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">kind of ongoing uh</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">and uh and and so on so i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">much uh</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">of um that was a very good distinction</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">by the way about</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">uh on the one hand you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">algorithm on the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">uh you&#39;ve got this wide open field and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">uh you&#39;ve either got chaos or you&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">somewhere up in the in the middle of</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:35.840" style="s2">balanced and so on and uh that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">very good that&#39;s very very nice thinking</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:46.159" style="s2">i want to respond both to your</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">aristotelian point and to your socratic</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">i&#39;ll respond first to the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">point uh so part of that of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:55.039" style="s2">the argument that&#39;s coming out now from</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">what&#39;s called 4e cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.039" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">the idea that cognition is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">embodied embedded extended and enacted</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.840" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">um and the work particularly of my</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:10.799" style="s2">and others is is this idea of</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">how a ship is navigated and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">bunch of people and you also have all</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">their instruments</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">and no one person navigates the ship the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">the networking</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">of the descriptive cognition right the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">people and the tools</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">right yeah what actually navigates the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">ship and you can also think of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">like you can extend that metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">to the ship and state</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">et cetera and then the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">idea there is what the research is now</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">showing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">reasoning let me be clear about how i</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">want to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">this term um i take rationality to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">much more than the logical management of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">inference i take rationality to be any</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">systematic and reliable</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">process or procedure uh for addressing</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">the ways in which we fall into</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">so i think that just like argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">can make you rational there&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">in which mindfulness practices can make</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">your irrational in an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">in a in an attentional way so</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">what is coming out of this is if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">if we if we if we take that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">rationality that more comprehensive and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">more ancient sense i would argue also</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">have increasing evidence for is that not</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">only is most of our cognition done in</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">most of it should be done in distributed</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">cognition because that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">that&#39;s where we optimally achieve sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.679" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">of overcoming self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not perfect it can&#39;t be that would</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">be algorithmic but it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">reliably</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">better um so if i&#39;m on my own</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">i&#39;m liable to fall into confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">bias but if i&#39;m talking with you as i am</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">uh that confirmation bias is liable to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">be challenged</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">because if i&#39;m if i&#39;m a tall empathetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">i will take your perspective and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">will get me out of being not</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">locked in to my own perspective right</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">so i i think that um the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">i often use the metaphor that long</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">before the internet networked compute</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">computers together culture networked</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">brains together embodied brains</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">people together uh within distributed</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">i think aristotle said that i think part</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">of the reason why people</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">are seeking out these biological</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">now to respond to your socrates point um</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:49.279" style="s2">you&#39;d be pleased to know that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">actually working on a series called</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.279" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">after socrates</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">that is about trying to uh recover</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">the ancient tradition of dialectic from</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">you know through the stoics and through</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">the neoplatonus</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">and try to unpack what that meant</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">as a project and what i want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">after sort of unpacking that as much as</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">i can</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">historically i want to put it into</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">forgive the pun i want to put it into</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">with all these emerging communities like</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">this one here</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">where people are trying to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">dialectical relationship again</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">as a way of understanding it and so one</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">comes out and you said uh theaters and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m reading many books around this</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">topic right now but</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:36.159" style="s2">one is an excellent book i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:39.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve read it by gonzalez called</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">uh dialectic and dialogue and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">how what plato&#39;s doing in the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">and he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">he shows that socrates often is</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">like if you if you read it too</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">superficially it looks like socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">just refuting people</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">but actually there&#39;s two types of things</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">he&#39;s constantly steering between</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">he&#39;s steering between the person who</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">just offers sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">first-person intuition right right but</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">he&#39;s also refuting people who often who</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">offer third person</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">perspective technical definitions so</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">uh when he when you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">pursuing courage they got the two</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">generals</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">and one gives his intuition and socrates</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">destroys it of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">and then the other gives his technical</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">definition he&#39;s learned from the sofas</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">and then socrates destroys that and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">as you pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">the dialogue looks like it ends in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">emporia but what gonzalez points out is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">things like courage actually and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">where i think it links up to what i said</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">about relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">can&#39;t be given any final definition uh a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">virtue is ver and this is aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">point as well right virtue is about</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">steering between the algorithmic and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">in an ongoing developmental fashion</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">and so what what gonzales argues is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">socrates can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">demonstrate with definition the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">but he often exemplifies it</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">in the actual process of the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">so gonzales points out something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">people often miss at the end of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">uh both generals are sort of pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">of course because they right</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">but they both say they want their sons</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">to come and spend time with socrates</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">oh yeah right right because</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">right because courage is something in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:23.039" style="s2">that sense you have to catch</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">in dialectic you can&#39;t define it and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.039" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">can&#39;t resolve it through debate</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">and so part of what i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:32.559" style="s2">right is this is this interconnection</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.559" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">dialectic uh i think you agree it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">kind of infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">steering the virtuous steering between</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">arbitrary and algorithmic</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">and this ability to also steer between</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">first-person immediacy and third-person</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">objectivity both as sort of authorities</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">that shut</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">down conversation in a profound way</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">and so that and i&#39;m trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">okay what does that look like what</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">how does that work and and so very much</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">um i i i&#39;m not trying to be socrates</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">that would be ridiculously hubristic</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">but i&#39;m trying to understand is there a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">way in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">bring that system of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">into how we&#39;re interacting like right</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">now for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">yeah well i i i hope i do hope i</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that&#39;s uh really um</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">uh you know that&#39;s the most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">element of our humanity</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">yes the the ability you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">socrates said or actually plato said it</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">i think socrates voiced it i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">which dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">uh he pointed out that dialect</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">dealecticae is the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">unnatural thing we have it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">strictly human</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">yes it&#39;s exactly what defines us</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">as human beings as opposed to animals</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">and and and then the other thing is and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">you you&#39;ve been applying this all along</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">in fact you&#39;ve said it pretty directly</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:14.080" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t have a goal it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">have an ending</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a resolution it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">and that that means that uh we we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">we have not only an open history but</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">an open interpretation of what our</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">history has</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">been yes and where it should be going</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">and so we have to look forward and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">backward</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">at the same time at the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">analysis and uh so uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m really uh right with you on this</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">uh on this uh uh on this exercise by the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">one other thing i loved about i i always</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">liked about aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">he can never decide anything he gets to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">you know the end he kind of fudges the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">ending of everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">he never is he&#39;s never absolutely that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">makes him infuriating to read but</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">but uh but on the other hand he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">that openness right at the end</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">no he&#39;s not a third person to use your</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">your election yes i i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">um so so james can i ask you a question</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">then that sort of points to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about in your first</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">book i&#39;m sorry and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">sorry i don&#39;t know it&#39;s your second book</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">but the second book by you i&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">back to the first book i read by you the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">one that really got me introduced to you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">and actually that&#39;s what influenced me</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">to influence casa to invite you to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">conference</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:41.760" style="s2">i should tell you a quick story about</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">this um so i have my son jason he&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">older son he&#39;s living with me right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m trying to get him like out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">sort of a cartesian pursuit of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">and you know we have all these ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">dialogues and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">he&#39;s doing all these practices with me</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">uh etc</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">but the thing i did the thing i did that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.360" style="s2">really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">loosened him up and set him in motion</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.360" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">and not</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">totally pleasantly for him it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:06.159" style="s2">also disruptive but in a really healthy</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.159" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">as i gave him your book and he came away</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">from that and this is what he said</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">and and take it let me finish it because</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">i think it&#39;s really high praise</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">he said this is a really great book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">so disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">um because it really</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">really um really shook him up and which</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">one the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">leaf book the yeah the religious case</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">against belief because</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">i think and i think this is a proper way</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">to put it in the language we&#39;re crafting</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">here together</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">it had a really huge socratic impact on</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">him it really</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">you know you know socrates wisdom begins</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">in wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">that that ability to you know open</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">things up and call things into question</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">to set them into motion</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">but here&#39;s here&#39;s the question i want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">ask because it&#39;s a question that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">also exploring</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">in this project and with other people um</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a one one critique i have of plato</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting i criticized sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">specific content on this but plato</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">exemplifies the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">so let me talk about the second thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">and you mentioned it too and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">i want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">start there for me plato is sacred</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">in the way you just described i can go</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">back to plato</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">right i&#39;ll get an insight i&#39;ll it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:20.480" style="s2">transform my life transform my life i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:22.079" style="s2">live a certain way things will unfold i</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.480" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">go back to plato and i see something i</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.079" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t see before</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">and then this reciprocal opening just</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">keeps happening again and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.720" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">again and again and plato&#39;s sacred for</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">me in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">because he&#39;s a he&#39;s an inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">fount of intelligibility right that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that i don&#39;t question him</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that i think he&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">everything&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s complete but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">this sense of sacredness as a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">opening into</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">the inexhaustible now that&#39;s what plato</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">exemplifies for me but one of my</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">problems with plato is he seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">a notion of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">as the perfect as the unchanging yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">right yeah yeah and that the point is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:04.079" style="s2">come to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.079" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">and i think that that has been woven</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">into our culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">in a fashion sorry sorry</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">that has been woven into our culture in</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">a fashion</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">that has been very deleterious to us i</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">that notion of sacredness as completion</p>

<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">i think that platonic notion of</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">culture in a way that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:52.320" style="s2">very detrimental to our experience of</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">this these so i do a lot of participant</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">this rediscovery what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">about here</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">but i see uh so carrie in his book uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.359" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">he talks about he it&#39;s titled</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">augustine&#39;s invention</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">of the inner self but he says that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">word he wants to use isn&#39;t the english</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">word invention he wants to use the latin</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">word inventio</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">that means both to discover and to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">right both</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">are just to make oh yeah and so what i</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">see people</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">doing in these practices these</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">dialogical practices</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">i see them in ventio or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">reinventio</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">sacredness they&#39;re transforming</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">sacredness not from</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">perfection completion lack of change</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">but instead this sense of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">you know the fount of you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">inexhaustible fount of ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s why the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">of emergence is so central now that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">point of the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">is to get emergent meaning rather than</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">to solidify positions</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">and so i i&#39;ll often uh a a a criterion</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">not a definition</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">that i&#39;ve come up for dialectic is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">you and i together get to a place we</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get to individually</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">and that that has a taste of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">to it because it gives us an</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">active sense of the inexhaustible right</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">so do you think that right</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">you see i&#39;m making a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">your first and second book that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">one motive why infinite game play</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">is becoming more both since both more</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">needed and more practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">is precisely because it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">people reinventio</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">this uh what what what sacredness means</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">and breaking us out</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:48.960" style="s2">of that aspect of plato that i think has</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">been detrimental</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.960" end="00:38:52.320" style="s2">uh to our our understanding what do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">think of that as a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.320" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">well let&#39;s hope that&#39;s the case i</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">i very much i very much agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">uh actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">the the uh my own view of plato is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">the only way you can read plato is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">have read</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:11.200" style="s2">the neo-platonists first yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">wow james i totally believe that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:19.599" style="s2">my gosh that&#39;s totally convergent</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">totally that is yes yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.599" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">so uh and the reason i say</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">that yeah you know very well what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">what the neoplaton has said is to look</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">at that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">that that platonic idea of the good the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">perfect the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">truth the light or whatever the hell you</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">lots of different names</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">uh is that essentially uh to realize</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:45.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get there</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s beyond you uh or as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.920" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">one of the jewish uh uh the mystics said</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">the only way you can know god is to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">yeah and uh and we we&#39;re a long way from</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">and as a result everything we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">is is essentially wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">i mean we&#39;re not there we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">truth the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">is uh elusive it&#39;s beyond us it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">still to be reached and so on</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very important that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">the the uh that&#39;s why plato&#39;s republic</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">is so interesting because in the</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2">yeah uh if you remember in the uh in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">announce the uh metaphor of the cave</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.640" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">of course the anagogic consent totally</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:47.630" style="s2">the fellow comes back and tries to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">the others to follow but they won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">and they were right not to in a way in a</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.680" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">my view is that they should have at</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:16.520" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting also is that that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">because um the way hegel conceived</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">was that it had a direction it</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">and i mean there&#39;s lots of good work</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">being done about this which brings me</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">again to a point that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">at the core of uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">the religious case against belief which</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">and this reminds me of uber it reminds</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">me of from</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">which is there&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">between you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">being curious and having a problem to</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">right there&#39;s a sense in which you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">read plato as</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">trying to turn wonder into awe</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">make it almost reverential um and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">clearly i mean when you read plato&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">that sense of mystery right is so so</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.839" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">profound so i&#39;m wondering then again</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">if right if what</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">part of what you could be</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.400" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">tell me if this is a fair interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:37.880" style="s2">is a kind of deep</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">i i would argue that it takes practice</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">it takes a community of practice</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">in order to do that oh oh oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">yeah no you&#39;re absolutely right right on</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">but uh but but in other words not not</p>

<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">and not completely wide open yep</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">but very nicely right up the uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">right up the middle as uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">yeah another another element that</p>

<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">idea of the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">is that is the place of history now now</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">racism</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">i mean we are for example as a nation</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">historically speaking you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">big history capital h history speaking</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:09.280" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:11.119" style="s2">not calendrical yeah uh we are still a</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">uh you know not only free the slaves we</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">haven&#39;t freed ourselves from that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">that mentality of uh of the slave owner</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">having a working class uh people you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">store</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">away in a ghetto or a slum or a prison</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">or uh you know off the map in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">in a reservation somewhere in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">desperate</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">desert location so um</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">i i i want to say that the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">brings</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">with it a sense of of history in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">sense not only that we have a past</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.240" end="00:48:56.000" style="s2">but we&#39;re a pet we&#39;re living a past yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">and the living</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:49:00.160" style="s2">living the past is also a way of living</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">a future</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">and um because we are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:06.160" style="s2">participating</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">we&#39;re either continuing it as it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.160" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">which is probably impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">but we&#39;re we&#39;re also transforming it as</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">we go along</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">yes and it gives us uh it it gives the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">meaning a much greater reach</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s not just that i have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:25.839" style="s2">meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">uh with you know within my</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.839" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">calendrical years but but that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">that my the meaningfulness of my life</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">continues through my children through my</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">through my friends through my through my</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">through my countrymen and through my</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">fellow human beings on and on</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2">uh so i would i would just introduce</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">that into the uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">into the discussion as uh not not as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">not as a uh critique or no no</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">no but as but as a continuous</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">uh contiguous idea i i think that point</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:02.319" style="s2">is actually confident with the previous</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">point i think it was plato&#39;s commitment</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">to perfection and unchanging ability</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">that made him disregard and i think and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">i also have critiques of the person i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">going to introduce now</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">but i think history in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about is very analogous</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:17.599" style="s2">to like in the sense that heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">often talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.599" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">um he&#39;s talking about it as i i</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">i often use this metaphor and you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">see how i&#39;m bridging between heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">and victoria in this metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">that history is the story of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">and how right um our cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">grammar</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">what&#39;s thinkable for us and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">doable for us uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">uh has you know it has a history to it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.240" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">there is a line of progression</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">um and like you say uh we may make</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:49.520" style="s2">certain political changes in</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">in the in the um modern sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.520" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">politics not an</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">aristotle sense we can make political</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.640" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">changes but that doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">changed the cultural grammar</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">the cultural cognitive grammar by which</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">we think and behave</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:02.640" style="s2">and so uh you know we&#39;re still we still</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:03.839" style="s2">think you know heidegger&#39;s notion that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.640" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">we treat everything as a standing</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.839" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">reserve</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">and things are largely objects to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">et cetera et cetera and i i agree</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">and so part of what i did in my series</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">awakening from the meeting crisis was</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">try to trace out the history</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">of that cultural cognitive grammar and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">how how much</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">it is so embedded in us and i think of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">your notion of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">availing it is so embedded into us that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s invisible to us because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">transparent</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:32.720" style="s2">like the lenses of my glasses are</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">transparent because precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">i&#39;m seeing through them and by means of</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t see them and there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a difficult philosophical task</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">of learning to do this step back and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">look at it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.960" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">rather than automatically unquestionably</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">no very important</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">critical yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:53.359" style="s2">um you know that my uh one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.359" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">argue in this the book i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">finished and still</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:03.599" style="s2">kind of fiddling with is that the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:04.400" style="s2">the first challenge of a teacher is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.599" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">his or her students to know what they</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">and they know a lot more than they think</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:13.920" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">and when i&#39;ve what i&#39;ve tried in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">book the reason i went back to plato and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">is that we see the tracks of their</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">thinking all</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">over our brains yes yeah they talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">you know we see them all through our</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">head you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.400" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">they thought this stuff up and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">still thinking it</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">yeah so so uh the the point is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking the language of the dead</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve been giving</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:42.559" style="s2">we&#39;ve been given this language we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">make it up this language has been around</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.559" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">for a hell of a long time</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">and this way of thinking and these these</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">ideas these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">even the grammar we speak and so on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">very very important</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">to take those glasses off and look at it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">look at what you look at what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:01.119" style="s2">in your head</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">yeah you don&#39;t realize it but and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.119" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">and then and then plato has this</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">you probably know his theory of</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">enemiesis which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:13.280" style="s2">the collective knowledge that is we we</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a knowledge we all</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.280" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">have we</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">just have to be reminded of it in in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">and and i i that&#39;s no one really buys</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">into that completely but</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">but on the other hand what he&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">at i think is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:32.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of fundamental of</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">of knowledge in us that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.480" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">that comes through our culture and uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">and we don&#39;t we don&#39;t see we see through</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:43.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">we see with it and uh rather than see</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.119" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">it and so one of the great jobs of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:50.400" style="s2">teacher i think as a writer too</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">is to get that it out there so you look</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.400" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">at it exactly</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:56.559" style="s2">see what you&#39;re doing so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">couple of thinkers that converged on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.559" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">way of talking about that after and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">metzinger and others</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:03.200" style="s2">uh they call it a transparency opacity</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">shift the ability to go from something</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.200" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">being transparent to being</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">opaque and then uh you you also need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">do the other you need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">sometimes stop looking at certain things</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">and learn</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">remember how to look through them again</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">yeah yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">right and so you know and so i i i</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">extend the analogy i say you know i step</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:23.599" style="s2">back and i look and see if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">distorting and i do this</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:27.599" style="s2">right to sort of transform my lenses but</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">how do i know that i&#39;ve actually cleaned</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.599" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">them well i have to put them back on and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">look through them and see if i can see</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">again right because and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.760" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">constantly go back and forth between the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">oh oh there&#39;s no final cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">we&#39;re filthy to the end you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">we&#39;re all we&#39;re all fake in a way yes so</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">but but uh but but there&#39;s they&#39;re are</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">qualities of fake fakery after all</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">but but anyway that i&#39;m glad you brought</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">that up</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">very nice point well uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know when peter wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">either yeah if you want you can open it</p>

<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:07.760" style="s2">um your your excitement is infectious</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">so my my question is what what changes</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">might be needed in our educational</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">system in order to popularize i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">want to use that word but i&#39;m using that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">um dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">whoa um go ahead john</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2">the reason i ask this is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">very difficult to engage in dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">with anybody i know</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">so i mean this is where the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">tradition is very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.000" end="00:56:38.880" style="s2">uh as james argued neil uh dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">the capstone</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.880" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">practice you you you don&#39;t you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:45.760" style="s2">a practice that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.799" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">um often we get the sense even in plato</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.760" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">you get a sense this is all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">and plato says you can&#39;t even start this</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">until you&#39;re 30 years old because you</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">have to do all this</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">this training um initially so i i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:00.160" style="s2">one of the things i&#39;m trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">peter and and with guy senstalk</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.160" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">and um elizabeth the bold and thomas</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">steiniger and</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">all of these amazing people is to try to</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:10.079" style="s2">figure out is there a way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:11.760" style="s2">can set</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.079" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">what i often call an ecology of practice</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.760" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">a sequence uh practices</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:18.160" style="s2">that will help take people into this uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">can we use something</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:21.680" style="s2">um you know like you know uh leher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:24.319" style="s2">work on philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.680" end="00:57:25.680" style="s2">companionship to just get people into uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.319" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">starting to talk to each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:28.319" style="s2">being mode</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">and then could we could we take them</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.319" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">into circling and or peter&#39;s anti-debate</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">and then could we and then could we put</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">right um also you know individual and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">collective mindfulness practices to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.160" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">what james and i are just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">learning to step back and look at and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">be learning just you know to to look</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2">through and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">i think you might have</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:57.280" style="s2">the proper educational program</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:58:00.240" style="s2">for introducing dialectic proper in</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.280" end="00:58:01.680" style="s2">and so in fact the neoplatonus even had</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.240" end="00:58:02.799" style="s2">a sequence by which you read the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.680" end="00:58:04.319" style="s2">dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.799" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">that was supposed to take you through</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">this sort of progression</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">um um into something like uh dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:14.079" style="s2">proper</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">i would also point out the work of my uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.079" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">at least i&#39;m i&#39;m on a stereo right now</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.280" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">he&#39;s very much in concert with what</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.640" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">james and i are talking about and trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:56.720" style="s2">reconfigure uh education and make it</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:59.280" style="s2">more in the service of</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.720" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">the normativity of culture and less in</p>

<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">and to try and build in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">progressive program</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:10.079" style="s2">where you lead people into this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:12.799" style="s2">by building up a scaffolding of skills</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.079" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">that enable it and make it possible you</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.799" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it john that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:16.720" style="s2">angle that i&#39;m coming from is that zack</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">stein&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.720" end="00:59:19.839" style="s2">education and time between worlds there</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">you go well there you go so</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.839" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not a coincidence i think but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">interested to hear what james has to say</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:30.319" style="s2">well uh the th</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">this opens the door to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.319" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">one of my big critiques of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">university which is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:41.520" style="s2">uh it&#39;s become dominated by uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">by money by yeah yeah by huge amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.520" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">and and what&#39;s happened i you know this</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:49.200" style="s2">sounds very dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">but i&#39;ll because we don&#39;t have much time</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.200" end="00:59:53.920" style="s2">i&#39;m going to make it sound extreme</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:54.799" style="s2">that is uh essentially what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.920" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">been happening</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.799" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">is as as the as wealthy donors and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">corporations and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">major industries contribute to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.440" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:11.280" style="s2">uh to a higher education and to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">to the learned institutes what we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.280" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:17.040" style="s2">is is people who are being</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">paid actually what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.040" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">buying knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:22.400" style="s2">and and what&#39;s happening in the uh in</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">the they determine</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.400" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">what kind of research is being done</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">what&#39;s going to be studied</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:30.799" style="s2">and what&#39;s going to be known uh now</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s extremely limiting</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.799" end="01:00:34.319" style="s2">and and uh and then on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">the faculty</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.319" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m really quite critical of my of</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:41.119" style="s2">my colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:43.920" style="s2">uh they&#39;re also a bit too much</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.119" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">for sale they&#39;re willing to sell their</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.920" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.319" end="01:00:50.720" style="s2">own careers for uh you know for</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">chairs and for uh extra funds and</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.720" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">so on for high salaries and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a great tragedy and i i</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:00.799" style="s2">i&#39;m rethinking a whole lot about the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">the university could be restructured</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m questioning a number of things</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">i&#39;m questioning for example</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:12.559" style="s2">just the the phenomenon of the semester</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">why why would education be just eight</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.559" end="01:01:16.640" style="s2">semesters</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">long a college education it should last</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">a lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">it should start back in childhood and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">continue</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.240" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">all the way to the end and uh and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:28.319" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">i&#39;m worried about the tuition problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.319" end="01:01:31.200" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">um essentially what you do when you pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.200" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">tuition is buying knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">you&#39;re buying you&#39;re buying you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">paying someone to teach you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">and the more money you have the more</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to teach you</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:42.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s it&#39;s a profound unfairness</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">and then the third</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.799" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">the third thing is uh admissions to</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.839" end="01:01:53.760" style="s2">to colleges um it&#39;s become so</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:55.039" style="s2">uh uh how should i say it&#39;s so selective</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.760" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">what we&#39;re really doing is now is</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">creating a kind of intellectual elite</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">that that basically gives a damn about</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:02.559" style="s2">the dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">uh they&#39;re they&#39;re they know they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:05.680" style="s2">care at all about it they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">dialectical thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.680" end="01:02:09.280" style="s2">and um they&#39;re actually what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">really learning</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.280" end="01:02:12.799" style="s2">is not dialogue they&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:15.839" style="s2">artisanship</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.799" end="01:02:18.319" style="s2">uh how to raise how to how to build a</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.839" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">corporation how to raise money how to</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.319" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">invest</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">and so on and those are those are really</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">very i think very</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">very destructive of the uh of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">university of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:34.400" style="s2">higher education uh all together which</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">which in fact the university in my view</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.400" end="01:02:39.839" style="s2">is is the is the west&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:41.039" style="s2">greatest achievement to create the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.839" end="01:02:43.440" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.039" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">and and now we&#39;re we&#39;re watching it uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.440" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">fall apart</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:49.039" style="s2">under the impact of uh corporate</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:52.079" style="s2">interests basically</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.039" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">that&#39;s simplistic but it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.079" end="01:02:55.440" style="s2">on the way to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:58.720" style="s2">i mean i i have a much broader critique</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.440" end="01:03:01.359" style="s2">but but that&#39;s basically the core of it</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.720" end="01:03:03.119" style="s2">so james i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read him</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.359" end="01:03:05.760" style="s2">i i met him at another conference</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.119" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">and we we we we hit it off and had quite</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.760" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">discussion in exchange nicholas</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:13.440" style="s2">maxwell&#39;s book from knowledge to wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:15.520" style="s2">which is exactly is a critique about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.440" end="01:03:18.640" style="s2">university along those lines</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.520" end="01:03:19.520" style="s2">that you&#39;ve just made yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.640" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">quite a good book</p>

<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">what it looked like to me was a just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.119" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">profound</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:57.839" style="s2">affinity that you guys had for each</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">other in that moment</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">that had been growing through the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">dialogue that started to feel like</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.119" end="01:05:06.400" style="s2">generative of the actual insights in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.400" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">yeah um and so i&#39;m just curious about</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:13.920" style="s2">about the connection between what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">think the connection is</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.920" end="01:05:20.720" style="s2">between um the personal</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">the personal aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.720" end="01:05:23.839" style="s2">of what people often only experience in</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">in like</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.839" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">intimate conversations right like um</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">personal intimacy</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">and the the corollary</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:35.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s the correlation</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:37.039" style="s2">between though that experience the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.760" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">connection that experience</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.039" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">and the experience of of of intimacy one</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.319" end="01:05:44.720" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:48.079" style="s2">in a philosophical dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.720" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">um i just i&#39;m fat i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.079" end="01:05:52.400" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m really struck by by whatever</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">that is because it seems</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.400" end="01:06:01.359" style="s2">it just seems very very um</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:05.440" style="s2">generative of of of the whole project</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.359" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">well my i don&#39;t know yeah john</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.440" end="01:06:08.720" style="s2">john could answer this too but my own</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">view is</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.720" end="01:06:14.960" style="s2">they should be continuous it is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">uh the personal and the intellectual uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.960" end="01:06:18.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t stop one to start the other uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.240" end="01:06:24.960" style="s2">you should uh being being intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">is not a solitary activity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.960" end="01:06:31.839" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a participatory activity</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:34.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s uh that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.839" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of sociality there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.319" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">companionship</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">uh that goes with well with with genuine</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:42.640" style="s2">intellectuality</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:44.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not being right or wrong it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.640" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">finding ways of continuing the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.839" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">conversation and uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:51.520" style="s2">that can that always involves uh a</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:55.119" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.520" end="01:06:57.119" style="s2">a deeply personal elements</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.119" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">so i i would agree with that especially</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.119" end="01:07:00.160" style="s2">the the continuity hypothesis of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:02.559" style="s2">invocation</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.160" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">of sort of participatory knowing which</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.559" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">is something</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:07.119" style="s2">some of you know and guy you know i talk</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:09.440" style="s2">about at length um</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.119" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">and i think i think those that affinity</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.440" end="01:07:13.760" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:14.960" style="s2">these are all interpenetrating and into</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.760" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">affording each other</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.960" end="01:07:19.200" style="s2">i think my participatory knowing of</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">myself and my participatory knowing of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.200" end="01:07:22.400" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">are not separable things i think and</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.400" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">this is part of what</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.680" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">christopher moore actually argues in his</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:29.599" style="s2">book on socrates</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:31.039" style="s2">socratic south knowledge socrates</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.599" end="01:07:33.680" style="s2">claimed that only by</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.039" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">examining others did he actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.680" end="01:07:37.039" style="s2">properly examine himself</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:39.520" style="s2">and the unexamined life is not worth</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.039" end="01:07:42.559" style="s2">living um as he famously said</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">at his uh at his apology</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.559" end="01:07:47.200" style="s2">so i think my participant nor knowing of</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">myself and my participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.200" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">of the other uh the other person</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">my community those are bound together</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">but i think they&#39;re also bound together</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">with the third which is uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:08:02.160" style="s2">we equally participate in</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:03.039" style="s2">uh distributed cognition uh and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.160" end="01:08:05.440" style="s2">talked about that</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.039" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">already that networking together and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.440" end="01:08:09.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.160" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">the way we i participated myself i</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.440" end="01:08:12.799" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:13.760" style="s2">with my other and then i participate in</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.799" end="01:08:16.000" style="s2">the culture</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.760" end="01:08:17.000" style="s2">of the just the distributed cognition i</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.000" end="01:08:19.359" style="s2">think those are all</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.000" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">interpenetrating and inter-affording and</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.359" end="01:08:23.679" style="s2">then the final thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:24.560" style="s2">all of that all of that interpenetrating</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.679" end="01:08:26.960" style="s2">recursive</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.560" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">thing going on that is has a</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.960" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">participatory relationship</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">with the environment right especially</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">the natural world</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">and the intelligibility of things the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">fact that the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:41.759" style="s2">is an inexhaustible horizon and source</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:44.000" style="s2">of new intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.759" end="01:08:45.839" style="s2">and and we are constantly in</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.000" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">participation with that so we</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.839" end="01:08:49.359" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:50.480" style="s2">in our ecology in our culture in each</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.359" end="01:08:52.560" style="s2">other in ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.480" end="01:08:54.319" style="s2">and all of those participatory knowings</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.560" end="01:08:55.199" style="s2">are deeply interpenetrating and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.319" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">intra-forwarding</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.199" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">and part of what dialectic is about is</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:03.839" style="s2">about getting that affinity</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">or you know uh accessed and accentuated</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.839" end="01:09:07.199" style="s2">more and more for people yeah very good</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:09.199" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:10.640" style="s2">i&#39;m glad you brought in the uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.199" end="01:09:13.520" style="s2">ecological element</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.640" end="01:09:14.960" style="s2">always yeah that&#39;s part of 40 cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.520" end="01:09:18.000" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.960" end="01:09:20.480" style="s2">yeah thanks god so i</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.000" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s much more about this and</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.480" end="01:09:22.880" style="s2">you and i have continual deal logos</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:25.279" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.880" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">but that&#39;s that that&#39;s at least the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.279" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">seed of my answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">really profound question oh</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">great oh</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.839" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">david collins you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:47.279" style="s2">hi uh first just thanks this is a joy</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:51.199" style="s2">and um want to push um somewhat unfairly</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.279" end="01:09:55.120" style="s2">to hear more about potential downsides</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.199" end="01:09:58.159" style="s2">in relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.120" end="01:10:01.920" style="s2">john is there a potential</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.159" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">for leaving things out to go for</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">relevance to salient</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.280" end="01:10:06.719" style="s2">what we just focus on and somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">analogously uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.719" end="01:10:10.800" style="s2">james with a kind of future oriented</p>

<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:19.600" style="s2">is there any risk of forgetting</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">where we start from i&#39;m reminded</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.600" end="01:10:24.320" style="s2">playfully in the timaeus</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">um yeah much of learning is about</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.320" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">recovering what we already know or where</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:30.480" style="s2">we oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:32.080" style="s2">started from thank you</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.480" end="01:10:34.960" style="s2">so i guess you mentioned me first so</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.080" end="01:10:37.600" style="s2">i&#39;ll answer first on this one um</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.960" end="01:10:38.400" style="s2">yeah i mean in fact that&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.600" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.400" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s always the case that we&#39;re leaving</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:44.320" style="s2">something out um</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:45.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what i mean about the and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.320" end="01:10:47.520" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.360" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">we have the experience of insight</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.520" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">insight is it&#39;s the experience of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.080" end="01:10:54.239" style="s2">uh our relevance realization framing has</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.239" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">realized that something has been left</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:10:58.640" style="s2">out and that it has to restructure</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:00.640" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.640" end="01:11:01.679" style="s2">and it self organizes that&#39;s so insight</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.640" end="01:11:04.560" style="s2">is a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.679" end="01:11:05.840" style="s2">developmental engine of the evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.560" end="01:11:07.040" style="s2">our relevance realization that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.840" end="01:11:09.520" style="s2">study insight</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.040" end="01:11:10.719" style="s2">so extensively uh as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.520" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">scientist</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.719" end="01:11:14.880" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.880" end="01:11:22.159" style="s2">i i guess the the the point there</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:24.000" style="s2">is can we cultivate the proper set of</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.159" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">virtues that stir us between arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.000" end="01:11:29.120" style="s2">and algorithmic</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">such that we are always open to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.120" end="01:11:32.400" style="s2">that self-correction because we will</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:34.560" style="s2">always be in need of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.400" end="01:11:36.159" style="s2">um and so i was trying to gesture</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.560" end="01:11:38.159" style="s2">towards that when i talked about</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.159" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">you know socrates&#39;s notion and i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.159" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">this does go back to socrates</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:43.679" style="s2">that wisdom begins in wonder and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">what plato does is try</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.679" end="01:11:49.520" style="s2">and uh uh he tries to bring</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">wonder into awe and then i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.520" end="01:11:54.880" style="s2">thinking of woodruff&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:58.400" style="s2">of reverence as the as the virtue</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.880" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">that uh that we cultivate uh for awe</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.400" end="01:12:02.640" style="s2">for wonder and all reverence is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">virtue uh that keeps us</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.640" end="01:12:09.280" style="s2">open not just representationally</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:12.000" style="s2">but in a participatory fashion to um</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.280" end="01:12:12.640" style="s2">uh to self-correction precisely because</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.000" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.640" end="01:12:17.920" style="s2">what ah and wonder do is put us in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.920" end="01:12:18.960" style="s2">place where we are motivated to call</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.920" end="01:12:21.199" style="s2">into question</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.960" end="01:12:23.040" style="s2">our most comprehensive sense of self and</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.199" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">world and i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.040" end="01:12:27.440" style="s2">that uh and i agree with woodruff that</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">the virtue of reverence</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.440" end="01:12:32.159" style="s2">uh maybe because it got associated with</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.560" end="01:12:34.239" style="s2">uh you know adherence to</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.159" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">particular creeds or dogmatics but the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.239" end="01:12:37.040" style="s2">virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">of reverence is a lost virtue in our</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.040" end="01:12:41.199" style="s2">culture we we complement</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.960" end="01:12:42.960" style="s2">people by saying that they&#39;re irreverent</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.199" end="01:12:45.840" style="s2">which is actually a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.960" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2">odd thing to do right an irreverent</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.840" end="01:12:48.080" style="s2">person somebody who&#39;s never capable of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.520" end="01:12:50.960" style="s2">reverence</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.080" end="01:12:51.760" style="s2">is deeply somebody who can&#39;t call their</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.960" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.760" end="01:12:56.640" style="s2">into question uh via wonder and awe</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.800" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">that they are not trying to matter to</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.640" end="01:13:01.440" style="s2">something greater than themselves</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:02.560" style="s2">and therefore uh given sort of our best</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.440" end="01:13:04.080" style="s2">understanding right now</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.560" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">uh they&#39;re condemning themselves to a</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.080" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">relatively unexamined life</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:08.800" style="s2">with very little meaning in life within</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:12.480" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.800" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">and so i think virtues are not</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.480" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">final solutions but virtues are our best</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:19.280" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:22.000" style="s2">of committing to maintaining</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.280" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">a participatory openness to the ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.000" end="01:13:27.040" style="s2">need for self-correction</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">that&#39;s how i would answer that david i</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.040" end="01:13:30.840" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:32.560" style="s2">improve on that that&#39;s lovely thanks</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.840" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">john well thank you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.560" end="01:13:38.640" style="s2">jim james i think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very it&#39;s very encouraging uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.640" end="01:13:42.640" style="s2">like to i mean we did meet before but it</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.400" end="01:13:44.080" style="s2">was very brief but to to</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.640" end="01:13:46.239" style="s2">you&#39;ve been in my thoughts for a very</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.080" end="01:13:48.320" style="s2">long time and it&#39;s very nice</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.239" end="01:13:49.280" style="s2">to find such affinity and consonants</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.320" end="01:13:51.520" style="s2">with him</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.280" end="01:13:53.199" style="s2">i i it&#39;s it&#39;s very philia for me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.520" end="01:13:56.960" style="s2">very very much enjoying oh</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.199" end="01:13:59.199" style="s2">good good yeah me too</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.960" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">so yeah time for about two more</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.199" end="01:14:04.960" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:04.960" style="s2">uh joe uh you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:08.320" style="s2">about ai</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.520" end="01:14:14.560" style="s2">yeah so it was kind of a broad question</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:16.880" style="s2">but i was just wondering if either of</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.560" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">you could riff on what it would</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:23.520" style="s2">look like or mean for ai to play</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:25.760" style="s2">the infinite game well</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.520" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">i mean maybe james will let me go first</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.760" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">on that because that is my wheelhouse as</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.120" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">a cognitive scientist</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:32.239" style="s2">i do a lot of work on ai especially</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:35.679" style="s2">artificial general intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.239" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">um so here&#39;s a brief answer but</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.679" end="01:14:38.960" style="s2">it it actually encompasses every i i</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:40.800" style="s2">think in a very</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.960" end="01:14:42.080" style="s2">at least at a stems to encompass</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.800" end="01:14:45.120" style="s2">everything james and i&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.080" end="01:14:45.120" style="s2">about i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:48.880" style="s2">for an ai to be able to play an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.440" end="01:14:50.480" style="s2">game and to also be</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.880" end="01:14:53.040" style="s2">generally artificially general</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.480" end="01:14:55.280" style="s2">intelligence is it has to be capable of</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.040" end="01:14:56.480" style="s2">relevance realization in the way i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.280" end="01:14:57.520" style="s2">been talking about it and that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.480" end="01:14:59.440" style="s2">precisely</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.520" end="01:15:01.040" style="s2">the thing that we are having so much</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.440" end="01:15:03.520" style="s2">difficulty in giving</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.040" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">our our artificial intelligence we can</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.520" end="01:15:06.800" style="s2">now we&#39;re starting to make some progress</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:08.480" style="s2">on it precisely because</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.800" end="01:15:10.560" style="s2">we are starting to if you look at you</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.480" end="01:15:12.080" style="s2">know hinton way back to 96</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.560" end="01:15:14.239" style="s2">and the wake sleep algorithm and all the</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.080" end="01:15:14.640" style="s2">work building on that what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:17.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.640" end="01:15:19.920" style="s2">and and they they sort of fell into this</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.840" end="01:15:21.679" style="s2">is that what you have is you have you</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.920" end="01:15:22.840" style="s2">know a dynamically self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.679" end="01:15:25.199" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.840" end="01:15:25.840" style="s2">right like implemented on a neural</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:27.120" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.840" end="01:15:28.400" style="s2">and what it does is it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.120" end="01:15:30.400" style="s2">implements exactly what i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.400" end="01:15:32.320" style="s2">about it introduces variation</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.400" end="01:15:34.560" style="s2">and then puts selection on it and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.320" end="01:15:35.600" style="s2">varies from that and so it&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.560" end="01:15:37.360" style="s2">evolving</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.600" end="01:15:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s fittedness now i&#39;m not saying the</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.360" end="01:15:42.480" style="s2">wake sleep algorithm is</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.960" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">the the the answer but the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.480" end="01:15:46.000" style="s2">deep learning is precisely so successful</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:49.360" style="s2">and we&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.000" end="01:15:50.080" style="s2">amazing burst of work in ai is precisely</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.360" end="01:15:52.080" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.080" end="01:15:53.440" style="s2">i think they are now turning to and this</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.080" end="01:15:56.000" style="s2">was dreifus&#39;s critique</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.440" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">way back when on what computers can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.000" end="01:15:58.000" style="s2">they&#39;re turning to the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:15:59.520" style="s2">relevance</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.000" end="01:16:02.080" style="s2">and they&#39;re making it central and</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.520" end="01:16:06.320" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing that a dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.080" end="01:16:07.679" style="s2">evolution of sort of ongoing constraint</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.320" end="01:16:09.280" style="s2">on the problem space</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.679" end="01:16:10.719" style="s2">is exactly what&#39;s needed to make</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.280" end="01:16:13.760" style="s2">something general intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.719" end="01:16:16.960" style="s2">and i think if we give it that ability</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.760" end="01:16:19.520" style="s2">um then we will have</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.960" end="01:16:22.800" style="s2">ai that can play infinite games as</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.520" end="01:16:22.800" style="s2">opposed to just finite games</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.760" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">yeah i more or less agree i&#39;m i i i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.960" end="01:16:31.280" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">hold out on on ai i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.280" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">first place i i&#39;m not that familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:40.880" style="s2">the literature but but</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.840" end="01:16:44.080" style="s2">um but i have such a respect for</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.880" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">uh how shall i say this the</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.080" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">uh the kind of uh i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:52.719" style="s2">for a word that the kind of fungibility</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:57.120" style="s2">of language</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.120" end="01:17:03.840" style="s2">and and evolves and changes and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.320" end="01:17:06.800" style="s2">the edges the edges get mushy</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.840" end="01:17:08.560" style="s2">and so on and this happens in a in a</p>

<p begin="01:17:08.560" end="01:17:12.880" style="s2">that that probably will never be</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.880" end="01:17:18.719" style="s2">uh in in any way so that that</p>

<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:23.600" style="s2">and uh can do uh extraordinary things i</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">mean i&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.600" end="01:17:30.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen it do amazing stuff um</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m holding out on it&#39;s its absolute</p>

<p begin="01:17:33.920" end="01:17:41.520" style="s2">i could be convinced but i&#39;m still um</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">i i would say that um i think the pro</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.520" end="01:17:44.239" style="s2">maybe this will</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:46.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;ll completely close the</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.239" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">gap between us but i&#39;ve argued that the</p>

<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:50.480" style="s2">trying to create artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.199" end="01:17:52.880" style="s2">is a misplaced project</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.480" end="01:17:54.159" style="s2">because the degree and this is already</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.880" end="01:17:55.520" style="s2">happening the degree to which we make</p>

<p begin="01:17:59.920" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">us they become subject to self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.320" end="01:18:05.679" style="s2">uh behavior and so we also need</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:07.520" style="s2">artificial</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.679" end="01:18:09.840" style="s2">uh uh to give them artificial</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.520" end="01:18:13.360" style="s2">rationality that&#39;s sort of going up</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.840" end="01:18:15.120" style="s2">but also going down um so far a</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.360" end="01:18:16.239" style="s2">cognitive science says that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.120" end="01:18:18.800" style="s2">only have</p>

<p begin="01:18:25.040" end="01:18:28.719" style="s2">and so i think that artificial</p>

<p begin="01:18:40.880" end="01:18:43.199" style="s2">well it won&#39;t be a machine anymore in</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:45.120" style="s2">some senses</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.199" end="01:18:47.280" style="s2">the machine has to be like what we are</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.120" end="01:18:48.560" style="s2">it has to things have to be matter to it</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.280" end="01:18:51.600" style="s2">precisely because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.560" end="01:18:53.199" style="s2">it has to take care of itself um it it</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.600" end="01:18:54.239" style="s2">constantly has to be making itself the</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.199" end="01:18:57.760" style="s2">way we are</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.239" end="01:18:59.679" style="s2">um the way living things are and</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.760" end="01:19:01.120" style="s2">i mean reid montague says you know the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.679" end="01:19:02.480" style="s2">difference between us and computers is</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.120" end="01:19:03.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t care about the information</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.480" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">they&#39;re processing</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:07.280" style="s2">and we do and i would argue that we care</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:09.600" style="s2">about it precisely because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.280" end="01:19:11.600" style="s2">always every moment to moment taking</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.600" end="01:19:13.760" style="s2">care of ourselves and each other</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.600" end="01:19:15.120" style="s2">and i think if we don&#39;t give that as a</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.760" end="01:19:18.080" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.120" end="01:19:20.000" style="s2">uh you know cons constitutive structure</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.080" end="01:19:23.280" style="s2">of these machines that they will never</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.000" end="01:19:27.520" style="s2">approach our kind of cognitive agency</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.280" end="01:19:27.520" style="s2">amen yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.679" end="01:19:30.960" style="s2">all right so we&#39;ll sneak in this last</p>

<p begin="01:19:42.400" end="01:19:45.760" style="s2">turn to universities in their current</p>

<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:05.600" style="s2">on lifelong learning how do we actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.080" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">go to a society that can</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.600" end="01:20:09.440" style="s2">that can transcend the current system in</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:11.120" style="s2">learning like</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.440" end="01:20:13.120" style="s2">is it how are we going to talk for 10</p>

<p begin="01:20:18.239" end="01:20:21.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a tough question um</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.760" end="01:20:25.920" style="s2">you um i i would put it very simply this</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.800" end="01:20:30.719" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.920" end="01:20:33.760" style="s2">start one rather than look for one</p>

<p begin="01:21:03.679" end="01:21:09.280" style="s2">uh and and uh i i just think it needs to</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.760" end="01:21:12.880" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.280" end="01:21:16.239" style="s2">sort of consciously pursued uh by</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.880" end="01:21:18.719" style="s2">by individuals uh i i i</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.239" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">wish i had a a better solution for it</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.719" end="01:21:23.360" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">uh but you you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.360" end="01:21:28.719" style="s2">actually it&#39;s the reason i went in i</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:32.400" style="s2">became a teacher</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.719" end="01:21:36.159" style="s2">i i wanted to engage in dialogue with uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.400" end="01:21:38.400" style="s2">with uh my fellow human beings and</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.159" end="01:21:39.840" style="s2">i found teaching a way to do that you</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:45.280" style="s2">but but uh that&#39;s one one way of doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.280" end="01:21:48.320" style="s2">it</p>

<p begin="01:21:58.880" end="01:22:02.639" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:03.920" style="s2">uh uh thing i do every morning live</p>

<p begin="01:22:41.120" end="01:22:44.800" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me a bit of a slogan and</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.440" end="01:22:46.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.800" end="01:22:48.000" style="s2">and i was just at the movement summit a</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.719" end="01:22:49.120" style="s2">couple weeks ago with rafe kelly and i</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.000" end="01:22:52.320" style="s2">was just impressed</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.120" end="01:22:54.960" style="s2">by all all of these you know growing</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.320" end="01:22:56.000" style="s2">communities of ecologies of practices</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.960" end="01:22:57.920" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.000" end="01:23:00.159" style="s2">responsible responding to the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.920" end="01:23:05.120" style="s2">crisis by</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.159" end="01:23:07.360" style="s2">very much by doing that you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.120" end="01:23:08.719" style="s2">and and what&#39;s also impressive is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.360" end="01:23:12.080" style="s2">degree to which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.719" end="01:23:14.560" style="s2">uh talking to each other um and</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.080" end="01:23:15.360" style="s2">not in the sense of trying to crush or</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.560" end="01:23:17.600" style="s2">conquer</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.360" end="01:23:18.800" style="s2">but much more in a sense of creating</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.600" end="01:23:23.280" style="s2">something like a wiki</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.800" end="01:23:27.280" style="s2">or a co-op uh structure between them and</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.280" end="01:23:29.760" style="s2">so i often talk about um that</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.280" end="01:23:32.320" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is in these movements</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.760" end="01:23:34.000" style="s2">is a blurring of the line between</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.320" end="01:23:35.360" style="s2">michael between education and</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.000" end="01:23:39.520" style="s2">enculturation</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.360" end="01:23:41.199" style="s2">um and i used to be quite pessimistic</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.520" end="01:23:43.120" style="s2">this is why i ended up doing something</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.199" end="01:23:46.400" style="s2">like awakening from the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.120" end="01:23:49.280" style="s2">uh because i i i saw</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.400" end="01:23:50.400" style="s2">the the a lot of the cultural machinery</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.280" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.400" end="01:23:54.480" style="s2">uh frustrating and crushing people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.880" end="01:23:56.880" style="s2">projects of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.480" end="01:23:57.760" style="s2">enhance uh meaning in life and cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.880" end="01:24:00.239" style="s2">wisdom but</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.760" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">i&#39;m more optimistic i i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.239" end="01:24:04.080" style="s2">that&#39;s why i did that slogan a few times</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:05.440" style="s2">a few weeks ago in the store with akira</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.080" end="01:24:07.600" style="s2">the dawn of about uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.440" end="01:24:10.320" style="s2">you know stealing the culture in the</p>

<p begin="01:24:12.239" end="01:24:15.199" style="s2">but do something like what happened in</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.199" end="01:24:18.480" style="s2">or you know or or or the rise of</p>
