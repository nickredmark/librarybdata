<p begin="00:00:00.149" end="00:00:05.759" style="s2">so very similar to the last Apple is</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.780" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">Apple number six which is comparing</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:10.950" style="s2">solutions so we all need and starts out</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:13.670" style="s2">very simple</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:15.690" style="s2">we all need food clothing shelter and</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.670" end="00:00:17.779" style="s2">other things like connection and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.690" end="00:00:22.260" style="s2">happiness but just food clothing shelter</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.779" end="00:00:25.650" style="s2">energy waste disposal we all have those</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.260" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">needs that need to be met and just to</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.650" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">live basically and so finding the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">solutions that already exist in those</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">fields and comparing them if I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">have water Dyke wipe water water is</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:45.020" style="s2">clearly also a necessity do I want if I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:47.969" style="s2">want clean water how do I get it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.020" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">where I currently am it involves turning</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.969" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">on the tap and then I filter my water</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.719" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">which probably isn&#39;t even super</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:57.030" style="s2">necessary since I live in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:00:59.820" style="s2">best cities in the world for water but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.030" end="00:01:02.129" style="s2">still do and but what does that entail</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.820" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">is my water system the best is my filter</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">for the price that I get and the water</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">quality I don&#39;t know I have no idea I</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">just go off with their branding and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:11.909" style="s2">they&#39;re like decently priced and not</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">astronomically about thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.909" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">dollars but not you know Burnett ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">dollars which I mean Brit is better than</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">nothing and I don&#39;t know maybe Brit is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">better than the one I have that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">spending too much money but comparing</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">them and so if you are starting a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:27.560" style="s2">community in the middle of nowhere with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">an intentional community how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.560" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">water how do you create and there&#39;s tons</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">of ways to do that there&#39;s tons of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">things that filter water and store water</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">and with water through but what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">best solution for you to implement the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">first cost as well as the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">maintenance is it easily maintained is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">to do it yourself do you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">through the company is it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">technological tool to compare the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">solutions so that anyone anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">world can go on and say ok price-wise</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">what&#39;s the best solution for me because</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:01.350" style="s2">like if I can create it for 30 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:02.790" style="s2">from what I have around great if I need</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.350" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">to spend ten thousand dollars but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.790" end="00:02:05.969" style="s2">going to last forever and I have ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">thousand people my community for each</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.969" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">willing to put an adult</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">great can it give water to ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">people and so just look at the actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">and comparing between them being able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:23.060" style="s2">follow and compare all of the amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">Kickstarter and such campaigns out there</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.060" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">that do solve some of these problems of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:32.189" style="s2">water energy generation but being able</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:33.659" style="s2">to I love seeing videos like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.189" end="00:02:36.209" style="s2">solution look at this cool house made of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.659" end="00:02:37.769" style="s2">like grown-up Lego look at the but like</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.209" end="00:02:40.650" style="s2">what does it actually cost to make that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.769" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">and can I get it transported to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.650" end="00:02:44.220" style="s2">want to know the I don&#39;t have to contact</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">the company myself and get all that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.220" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">information the next person has to to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.459" style="s2">able to compare them for every person on</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">the planet so I mean since they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.459" end="00:02:56.940" style="s2">that complicated but if I&#39;m a village in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:02:58.139" style="s2">Africa what could be said to me because</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.940" end="00:03:00.019" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t help if it&#39;s a solution that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.139" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">I&#39;m not like I can&#39;t get shipped to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.019" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">so what&#39;s the what&#39;s the possibility we</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:08.970" style="s2">don&#39;t need to go that far because our</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:11.250" style="s2">reservations here have horrible drinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">water in a lot of them and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.250" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">government clearly not solving that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:19.139" style="s2">problem so as sad as it is it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:21.109" style="s2">people to solve it so how can you solve</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.139" end="00:03:26.040" style="s2">it how can you get clean drinking water</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.109" end="00:03:28.530" style="s2">on the land that you live on and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.040" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">are the solutions and part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.530" end="00:03:33.629" style="s2">getting the government involves but</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:36.629" style="s2">finding ways that you can I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.629" end="00:03:40.709" style="s2">collect rainwater and filter the water</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.629" end="00:03:43.319" style="s2">you have for the cheapest possible is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.709" end="00:03:44.790" style="s2">measure you have right now that you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.319" end="00:03:47.159" style="s2">do but you know it you know the compare</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.790" end="00:03:49.199" style="s2">the ideas for the most cost-effective</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.159" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">the most the ones that are going to last</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.199" end="00:03:54.870" style="s2">the longest I think is really important</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:03:58.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s also very line with finding out</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">what we have now currently and moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.079" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">forward from there</p>
