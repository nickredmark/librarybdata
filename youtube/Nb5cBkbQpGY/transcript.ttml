<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:14.750" style="s2">So one of the propositions that I?</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:19.340" style="s2">Set forth for you last week was that</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.580" end="00:00:22.639" style="s2">the most real Things are</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:27.319" style="s2">the things that are most permanent across time and and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:35.479" style="s2">Manifests themselves in the largest number of situations and those are the things that you have to map successfully in order to survive</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.420" end="00:00:41.030" style="s2">survive of individuals that survive as a species over a very long period Of time and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:44.060" style="s2">the question is one question is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.580" end="00:00:46.580" style="s2">what are the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.650" end="00:00:50.779" style="s2">constants of experience if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.450" end="00:00:53.450" style="s2">follower of the Evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.600" end="00:00:58.550" style="s2">Psychologists and to some degree the evolutionary biologist, but I would say more the psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:03.140" style="s2">like to be in close Metis</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:07.129" style="s2">They have a very afro centric</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:12.079" style="s2">view of Human evolution and the idea basically is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:20.780" style="s2">After we diverged from the common ancestor between Chimpanzees Bonobos and human beings</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:26.030" style="s2">We spent a tremendous amount of time in the african environment</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:30.500" style="s2">Mostly on the veldt although. We&#39;re not absolutely certain about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:36.649" style="s2">We&#39;re also very good in water human beings and we have some of the features of aquatic mammals</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:38.729" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.729" end="00:01:40.729" style="s2">while hairlessness being one of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">Women have a subcutaneously</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:49.729" style="s2">They are fat or feeder quite nicely adapted for swimming and so buckminster fuller who I wouldn&#39;t call a mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">evolutionary psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:58.580" style="s2">Hypothesized back in the 70s that we spent some period of time in our evolutionary history living on beaches near the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.010" end="00:02:01.010" style="s2">That idea really</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:07.580" style="s2">Echoes for me because we like beaches a lot, and it&#39;s a great place if you want to get easy food</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.580" end="00:02:11.659" style="s2">And we&#39;re pretty damn good at swimming for for Terrestrial mammals</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.659" end="00:02:12.590" style="s2">And we are hairless</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.590" end="00:02:17.750" style="s2">And we do cry salt tears and there&#39;s a lot of evidence that we and our feet if you think about our feet</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.750" end="00:02:22.969" style="s2">They&#39;re quite flipper like I know we are stand up and all that and walk, so that&#39;s part of the adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.969" end="00:02:24.930" style="s2">But we&#39;re pretty good at swimming</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.930" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:27.540" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.540" end="00:02:32.150" style="s2">The classical evolutionary psychology view is that we spent most of our time on the African veldt?</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:35.809" style="s2">It in the critical period of our evolutionary development</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.810" end="00:02:42.110" style="s2">let&#39;s say after we diverged from this common ancestor, and that were adapted for that environment and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.050" end="00:02:49.520" style="s2">consequences of that is the idea that we&#39;re that things have changed so much around us that we&#39;re really not adapted to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:55.339" style="s2">environment that we&#39;re in anymore, and I really believe that because I think that the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.069" end="00:02:58.069" style="s2">primary Forces that shaped our evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:00.950" style="s2">shaped them during that period of time</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:03.269" style="s2">call it A</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.269" end="00:03:07.279" style="s2">Roughly a seven million period Year period of time something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:15.950" style="s2">That that was somehow a special time for human evolution that set our nature. I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">I mean, it&#39;s true to some degree, but</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:26.509" style="s2">it&#39;s more useful to view the evolution of human cognitive processes over the entire span of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:30.529" style="s2">Evolutionary history and not necessarily give preference to any particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.170" end="00:03:37.579" style="s2">Epoch and I certainly believe that the idea that we&#39;re no longer adapted to the environment because of our rapid technological</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:43.609" style="s2">Transformations is simply not true and the reason. I think that it&#39;s not true is because the fundamental constants of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.700" end="00:03:50.929" style="s2">Environment let&#39;s say or it&#39;s more of the fundamental constants constituent elements of being I think that&#39;s the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:53.450" style="s2">They&#39;re the same they haven&#39;t changed a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.450" end="00:03:59.119" style="s2">and there is no way of changing them as far as I can tell without us being radically and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:06.828" style="s2">Incomprehensibly different than we are and you know with with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.989" end="00:04:10.159" style="s2">It&#39;s certainly possible then in five hundred years will be completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:15.619" style="s2">Will be so like unlike the way we are now that we won&#39;t even be the same creatures</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.620" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a particularly great outcome, but it&#39;s certainly possible. So what are the fundamental?</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">constituent Elements</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:29.720" style="s2">Well, they&#39;re expressed in mythology, but they&#39;re not merely symbolic. I think it&#39;s the wrong way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.970" end="00:04:36.140" style="s2">They&#39;re symbolic, but they reflect a very deep reality and they actually reflect a reality that&#39;s not easily apprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.900" end="00:04:42.260" style="s2">Directly by the senses now your senses are tuned for a particular duration</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.140" end="00:04:45.140" style="s2">That&#39;s roughly excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.270" end="00:04:51.529" style="s2">That&#39;s roughly the duration that you live let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.530" end="00:04:57.559" style="s2">But more importantly it&#39;s the duration whatever that duration is across which meaningful actions take place</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.560" end="00:05:01.220" style="s2">And we kind of have some idea of what that duration is. You know if you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">computer screen if</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:04.170" style="s2">it has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.170" end="00:05:10.640" style="s2">Refresh rate of less than 60 Hertz you can see it&#39;s liquor abut above 60 Hertz you can&#39;t its uniform and with movies</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.090" end="00:05:16.730" style="s2">Anywhere between 20 and 50 frames a second is enough to give you the illusion of continual motion</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.100" end="00:05:20.059" style="s2">so you know we live in a universe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:25.429" style="s2">Above the tenth of a second domain or maybe the hundredth of a second somewhere in there anyways</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.430" end="00:05:28.730" style="s2">And I mean it&#39;s not like time isn&#39;t almost infinitely subdivide</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.310" end="00:05:32.839" style="s2">At higher levels of resolution than that, but we don&#39;t operate</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.450" end="00:05:35.960" style="s2">generally speaking at higher temporary</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.670" end="00:05:50.300" style="s2">A something approximating 1/2 a second to a second you know I mean, it&#39;s an estimate obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.300" end="00:05:50.820" style="s2">but a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.820" end="00:05:51.510" style="s2">second is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.510" end="00:05:57.379" style="s2">meaningful unit of time for a person and a hundredth of a second really isn&#39;t and certainly a billionth of a second isn&#39;t and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:01.369" style="s2">You know we can think across hours and days and weeks and months</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:07.279" style="s2">But we really can&#39;t once you start getting out in two years it gets kind of sketchy and it&#39;s hard to think more than five</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:13.640" style="s2">Years down the road and the reason for that is that the particulars upon which you&#39;re basing your predictions are likely to change</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.100" end="00:06:20.989" style="s2">Sufficiently over a five year period So that extending out your vision past that just exposes you to accelerating error</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:26.089" style="s2">Right and that and of course that&#39;s the problem with predicting the future period So we live in a time range</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.090" end="00:06:30.950" style="s2">That&#39;s about say a tenth of a second to three three years something like that now</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.950" end="00:06:32.450" style="s2">I know it can expand Beyond up</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.450" end="00:06:38.689" style="s2">But that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of where we&#39;re set and our senses seem to be tuned to those durations and and to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.910" end="00:06:40.910" style="s2">Operative so that we make proper</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:47.779" style="s2">Decisions within those durations and and also from from a particular spatial position and so forth you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.090" end="00:06:50.269" style="s2">Your eyes see what&#39;s roughly</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.159" end="00:06:56.438" style="s2">Maybe we could say a walkable distance in front of you something like that, so</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.019" end="00:07:02.739" style="s2">Then you get detect things and in the locale that enables you to immediately interact with things</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.079" end="00:07:07.388" style="s2">But it isn&#39;t necessarily the case that senses that are tuned to do that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.639" end="00:07:15.639" style="s2">Also tuned to inform you directly about what the most permanent things about being itself are I think that those things have to be?</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.829" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">Inferred and there&#39;s some there&#39;s some supporting evidence for that kind of thing from</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.379" end="00:07:23.379" style="s2">from pSycholinguistics</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.349" end="00:07:26.179" style="s2">there&#39;s a level of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.179" end="00:07:28.179" style="s2">categorization that we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:34.419" style="s2">Manifest more or less automatically or implicitly so for example when children perceive?</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.149" end="00:07:38.738" style="s2">Animals they they perceive at the level of cat or dog</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.739" end="00:07:44.859" style="s2">They don&#39;t they don&#39;t perceive at the level of subspecies like siamese cat or or?</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.379" end="00:07:50.528" style="s2">Or or let&#39;s say samoyed you know there&#39;s this. There&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.529" end="00:07:53.648" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember what they call that base category something like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.649" end="00:07:57.458" style="s2">it&#39;s usually specified by very short words that are easily learn about and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.529" end="00:08:01.208" style="s2">Linguistic system seems to map right on to the to the object recognition</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.409" end="00:08:08.468" style="s2">Characteristics of the Sensory systems that are built right into it and and if they weren&#39;t built into it</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.469" end="00:08:14.018" style="s2">We couldn&#39;t communicate easily because our natural categories. I think that&#39;s it, but it&#39;s probably wrong our natural categories</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.209" end="00:08:19.359" style="s2">They have to be the same for every one or it would be very difficult for us to communicate, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:22.029" style="s2">So having said all that then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.669" end="00:08:24.669" style="s2">Well, what are the most?</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.309" end="00:08:27.338" style="s2">What are the most real categories?</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.339" end="00:08:34.208" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s there&#39;s a real division in ways to think about this because there&#39;s a scientific way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.550" end="00:08:38.949" style="s2">And in in that case the most real categories are well</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.349" end="00:08:44.739" style="s2">mathematical equations certainly seem to be and in the top category there that equations that describe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.259" end="00:08:47.859" style="s2">physical universe, but then then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.470" end="00:08:49.639" style="s2">hypothesis of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.639" end="00:08:52.628" style="s2">the existence of such things as protons and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.209" end="00:09:00.789" style="s2">electrons, and you know that the material elements that make up everything that&#39;s every element of being the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">possible exception of empty space</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.820" end="00:09:11.260" style="s2">But in the in the mythological world the categories, I think are more derived from Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.200" end="00:09:16.450" style="s2">by the effect of Darwinian processes on cognitive and perceptual function</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.850" end="00:09:22.719" style="s2">So which is to say that we have learned to perceive and then to infer those things that are most necessary?</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.820" end="00:09:25.270" style="s2">For us in order to continue our existence</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.490" end="00:09:30.669" style="s2">Propagate live well all of those things and that would be true at the level of individual survival</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.670" end="00:09:33.039" style="s2">And maybe it&#39;s also true at the level of Growth survival although</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.260" end="00:09:40.210" style="s2">You know the there&#39;s a tremendous debate among evolutionary biologists about whether or not selection can take place at the level of the group</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.050" end="00:09:49.629" style="s2">Anyways there are these basic level categories that manifest themselves to you and then there&#39;s categories of the imagination that you have to infer up</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.880" end="00:09:53.410" style="s2">from the sensory domain and we do that partly in Science by</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.710" end="00:09:57.610" style="s2">Comparing our sensory representations across people</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.610" end="00:10:01.479" style="s2">But we also do it by thinking abstractly conceptualizing abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.480" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">And you know one of the things that&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.700" end="00:10:11.590" style="s2">Abstractions is it&#39;s not clear whether they&#39;re more or less real than the things they&#39;re abstracted from you know that this is a perennial debate</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.900" end="00:10:14.350" style="s2">among let&#39;s call them ontology who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.960" end="00:10:21.850" style="s2">interested in that fundamental fundamental nature of reality itself in some sense independent of Conceptual structures are</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.040" end="00:10:27.939" style="s2">numbers more or less real than the things they represent it&#39;s a really hard question to answer because</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.090" end="00:10:34.269" style="s2">Knowing like using numbers as a representational system gives you unbelievable power</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.270" end="00:10:38.590" style="s2">And there are mathematicians that believe that there isn&#39;t anything more real than mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.900" end="00:10:45.400" style="s2">Representations now it depends to some degree of course on how you classify reality. That&#39;s the problem with the question like is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.850" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">Equivalent to be the answer that always is well it depends on how you define a and it depends on how you define b</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:59.019" style="s2">So generally it&#39;s not a very useful question, but you can still get the point that there&#39;s something very real about abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.230" end="00:11:04.449" style="s2">Incredibly real because otherwise why would you bother with them they wouldn&#39;t give you any handle on the world?</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.700" end="00:11:08.410" style="s2">So what&#39;s the what&#39;s the most useful or what&#39;s the most?</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:13.359" style="s2">What&#39;s the broadest possible level of abstraction and is there any use of?</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:16.900" style="s2">any utility in thinking in that manner and I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.500" end="00:11:20.440" style="s2">make the case last time that that in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.660" end="00:11:26.020" style="s2">Mythological world there are three categories or four depending on what you do with the strange fourth Category?</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.210" end="00:11:29.949" style="s2">There&#39;s a fourth category sort of the category of on categories able</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.740" end="00:11:32.060" style="s2">entities and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.060" end="00:11:37.539" style="s2">So it&#39;s sort of the category of everything that not only do you not know but you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.670" end="00:11:42.700" style="s2">You can think about it as the category of potential. I actually think that&#39;s the best way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.700" end="00:11:47.559" style="s2">Is that it&#39;s the dragon of Chaos is the category of potential, and I do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.380" end="00:11:51.309" style="s2">Where our materialist view is essentially wrong?</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.310" end="00:11:55.119" style="s2">I think that the proper way of looking at the at being is that being is?</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.610" end="00:12:02.710" style="s2">Potential and from that potential whatever consciousness is extracts out the reality that we inhabit anyways</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.710" end="00:12:04.989" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly the mythological Viewpoint and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.510" end="00:12:09.010" style="s2">But it&#39;s not just a mythological Viewpoint. It&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.380" end="00:12:15.130" style="s2">sequence of ideas for example that deeply underlies the thinking of young piaget and piaget by the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.130" end="00:12:17.439" style="s2">it was very interested in reconciling the gap between</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.780" end="00:12:20.919" style="s2">religion and science that&#39;s really what he devoted his life to doing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.050" end="00:12:26.349" style="s2">So and there are other streams of philosophy and I would say heidegger the phenomenologist are are</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.050" end="00:12:32.830" style="s2">Thinking along lines that are similar to this as well because heidegger was concerned not with the nature of material reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.830" end="00:12:35.770" style="s2">but with being as such and and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.350" end="00:12:37.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.640" end="00:12:43.659" style="s2">You can extract out the viewpoint that I just described from from Mythology, but it isn&#39;t the only source of such</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.810" end="00:12:46.460" style="s2">What would you call it?</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.460" end="00:12:48.460" style="s2">Hi</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">hypotheses is probably the right idea so the idea you can think about this as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.260" end="00:13:00.249" style="s2">bootstrapping process in some senses in order for anything to get going it has to bootstrap itself up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.470" end="00:13:03.460" style="s2">Become more and more complex as it does that so it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.460" end="00:13:05.460" style="s2">This is the answer to the chicken and egg problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.720" end="00:13:08.680" style="s2">Right which was first the chicken or the egg well neither</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.020" end="00:13:12.849" style="s2">Something from which both the chicken and egg were derived right because the the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.010" end="00:13:16.809" style="s2">The ultimate answer to that is the answer to how there are things at all who knows</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.910" end="00:13:23.830" style="s2">but at some point there were neither chickens nor eggs, but there were the things that were the precursors to those things and so they</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:28.900" style="s2">spiraled upwards in some sense and those in the initial</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.660" end="00:13:31.209" style="s2">proto anta tease</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.209" end="00:13:33.079" style="s2">single celled animals for I</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.079" end="00:13:39.099" style="s2">Mean you can go back farther than that, but we could say well, single-cell animal is differentiated over time right, and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.740" end="00:13:41.629" style="s2">Looping process</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.629" end="00:13:45.579" style="s2">that that differentiates out into both the chicken and the egg so</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.069" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">but what the question is what do you need in order for that process to begin and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.540" end="00:13:58.119" style="s2">That&#39;s really the question of what the fundamental constituent elements of reality are and the mythological hypothesis. Is that there&#39;s or three or four?</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.850" end="00:14:05.230" style="s2">One is the fact that there has to be something that that that that manifests itself as an observer</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.230" end="00:14:10.059" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that some kind of observer now where that process of observation</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.459" end="00:14:16.868" style="s2">Starts in the Phylogenetic chain is very very difficult to tell you know we might say well. There&#39;s certainly nothing</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.540" end="00:14:21.069" style="s2">Of a conscious observer until there&#39;s a differentiated nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.069" end="00:14:24.819" style="s2">But then prior to the emergence of differentiated nervous systems there were</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.069" end="00:14:31.779" style="s2">Animals that were complex enough to react with the environment in a manner that well single-celled animals. They&#39;re quite complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.779" end="00:14:38.048" style="s2">I mean some of them are unbelievably complicated. You know they can move themselves through space they can orient they can follow chemical trails</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.269" end="00:14:40.989" style="s2">They&#39;re not they&#39;re not stupid by any stretch of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.629" end="00:14:43.629" style="s2">now to what degree</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.389" end="00:14:51.669" style="s2">They have being you know as something they could represent well. We don&#39;t have to speculate on that, but the proto elements of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:57.068" style="s2">Conscious being are there so you need you need a being you need?</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:01.059" style="s2">that the structure of that being through which the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.389" end="00:15:05.529" style="s2">The entirety of being itself is interpreted and you need</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.470" end="00:15:12.850" style="s2">The surround it&#39;s something like that and so I conceptualize that as something that knows that&#39;s the knower</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.670" end="00:15:18.879" style="s2">what it knows that&#39;s the interpretive structure and that which needs to be known or</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:22.179" style="s2">you could could conceptualize that as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.910" end="00:15:24.910" style="s2">individual in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.160" end="00:15:29.019" style="s2">explored territory nested inside unexplored territory</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.089" end="00:15:32.768" style="s2">That&#39;s another way of thinking about it or you can think about it as the individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.230" end="00:15:39.849" style="s2">Inside culture and the individual culture has nested inside nature that&#39;s another way of looking at it, or you can think of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.850" end="00:15:43.809" style="s2">but as the knower and in order surrounded by Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.710" end="00:15:48.340" style="s2">That&#39;s another way of thinking about it, but all these things you know, they&#39;re all attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:54.730" style="s2">Articulate the same underlying structure you see that in narratives continually</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.730" end="00:15:57.999" style="s2">And I think pinocchio is a very good example of that because in pinocchio you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.820" end="00:16:00.910" style="s2">the culture, that&#39;s Geppetto and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.820" end="00:16:03.820" style="s2">Geppetto is obviously creative, but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.670" end="00:16:05.560" style="s2">insufficient and dead</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.560" end="00:16:08.860" style="s2">Which is why he ends up in the belly of the whale you have the blue fairy</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.110" end="00:16:12.069" style="s2">whose mother Nature for all intents and purposes the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.500" end="00:16:19.510" style="s2">Negative feminine doesn&#39;t manifest itself much in the pinocchio story except implicitly in the form of the whale the thing at the bottom that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.610" end="00:16:24.039" style="s2">which is more like the dragon of Chaos than something feminine that swallows up the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.710" end="00:16:32.710" style="s2">swallows Up culture, but you have Nature or culture Geppetto Nature the blue Fairy and then the puppet pinocchio and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.530" end="00:16:40.660" style="s2">You know from a strictly scientific perspective. We think of human beings as nothing, but the children of nature and culture and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.630" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">Pushes You Towards a kind of deterministic view what causes your behavior?</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:47.529" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s either nature or culture because there isn&#39;t anything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.780" end="00:16:52.180" style="s2">But that isn&#39;t how the mythological story lays itself out because it says there is something else</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.180" end="00:16:59.019" style="s2">And that&#39;s whatever your consciousness is and that consciousness seems to be able to work with nature and culture in a non</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.240" end="00:17:01.960" style="s2">deterministic Manner in order to bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.840" end="00:17:04.840" style="s2">Well in order for what?</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.830" end="00:17:12.099" style="s2">In order to bring itself forward I mean and that&#39;s really and what&#39;s interesting about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.100" end="00:17:15.070" style="s2">I think is that it isn&#39;t obviously just the plot of pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.070" end="00:17:19.749" style="s2">It&#39;s virtually the plot of any story is the story of the development of the individual now</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.540" end="00:17:22.280" style="s2">the Story is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.280" end="00:17:24.170" style="s2">order Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.170" end="00:17:31.060" style="s2">Higher order Roughly speaking so you can get variants of that you can get order collapses into disorder and nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.450" end="00:17:39.519" style="s2">Resolved that&#39;s a tragedy right and and you can get so so you don&#39;t have to have the entire story</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.670" end="00:17:42.820" style="s2">Represented in this story, but you get fragments of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.820" end="00:17:44.410" style="s2">It&#39;s a classic u-shaped story</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.410" end="00:17:49.930" style="s2">And what it is is the story of the development of the individual across time as a consequence of his or her?</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.090" end="00:17:55.000" style="s2">adventures in time and space and every story is exactly that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.490" end="00:18:02.120" style="s2">Those are representations of the manner in which you come to be in the world for better or for worse</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.220" end="00:18:07.730" style="s2">It&#39;s differentiated so the individual has a negative and a pause development and culture has a negative and a positive</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.010" end="00:18:13.579" style="s2">Element the Nature does as well and that makes the potential for plots much broader</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.250" end="00:18:15.300" style="s2">but and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.300" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">I think it&#39;s also very useful to know that entire story because I think it&#39;s one of the things that protects you against</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.760" end="00:18:22.100" style="s2">Ideology it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.100" end="00:18:27.290" style="s2">Where if someone tells you a political story or a story of any sort you can always ask well?</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.290" end="00:18:29.989" style="s2">Where are the missing characters human beings are terrible?</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.990" end="00:18:36.469" style="s2">They directed a culture that&#39;s destroying the planet and nature is been if you know benevolent and and pristine</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.470" end="00:18:39.860" style="s2">It&#39;s like yeah fair enough accurate, but you missing half the characters</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.560" end="00:18:42.560" style="s2">Because humans are not just terrible</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.810" end="00:18:48.560" style="s2">rapacious creatures and culture is not just a destructive force and nature is by no means on our side, so</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.290" end="00:18:54.560" style="s2">Where&#39;s the missing characters you need all the characters in the representation to get it right?</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.660" end="00:18:57.649" style="s2">And I really believe this to be true. So for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.290" end="00:19:01.820" style="s2">If you want to protect yourself against trauma as you move forward in life</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.010" end="00:19:09.560" style="s2">You have to be very aware of the three three negative characters you have to know that the human individual has an adversarial element</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.560" end="00:19:16.549" style="s2">That&#39;s malevolent right to the core and if you don&#39;t know that and you run across someone who&#39;s malevolent you will end up damaged</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.010" end="00:19:19.459" style="s2">So because first you won&#39;t be able to defend yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.460" end="00:19:24.620" style="s2">You&#39;ll just be like a ripe fruit tree for the plucking and second the mere existence of someone like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.840" end="00:19:31.010" style="s2">will pose such a threat to the way that you&#39;ve organized the world that it might collapse on you that happens to people all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.010" end="00:19:34.099" style="s2">Time so it really matters whether you know these categories</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.100" end="00:19:36.380" style="s2">and it matters that you know that culture can become</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.450" end="00:19:37.340" style="s2">Tyrannical it really</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.340" end="00:19:41.780" style="s2">But that it&#39;s also you&#39;re the father that&#39;s given you everything and it matters that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.880" end="00:19:45.859" style="s2">Everything good comes from nature and that we need to live in harmony with Nature to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.860" end="00:19:48.140" style="s2">But that it&#39;s also hell bent on our destruction</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.750" end="00:19:51.560" style="s2">Every second and it&#39;s very paradoxical</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:57.800" style="s2">It&#39;s a hard thing to reconcile with with with a with a thought structure like modern science</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.800" end="00:20:02.989" style="s2">That&#39;s based on a strict logic that always says something can&#39;t be itself and it&#39;s opposite at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.990" end="00:20:05.300" style="s2">But you know human beings can certainly be</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.210" end="00:20:10.940" style="s2">something and it&#39;s opposite at the same time and anything truly complex can have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:16.739" style="s2">And does have that nature if someone offers you a new job you think well? That&#39;s positive. It&#39;s like no, it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.560" end="00:20:23.519" style="s2">It&#39;s positive and negative and complex it might be the solution to your problem, but at the same set time</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:26.940" style="s2">It&#39;s going to generate a whole host of other problems so lots of times</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">We&#39;re encountering</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.070" end="00:20:35.399" style="s2">entities in some sense that have an internally paradoxical structure and we have to deal with that entire set of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.620" end="00:20:39.000" style="s2">Paradoxes or or we don&#39;t survive it&#39;s really a matter of survival</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.700" end="00:20:41.260" style="s2">okay, so</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.260" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">So on and then you know there&#39;s this overarching symbol which is the dragon of Chaos which is potential itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:52.229" style="s2">and it&#39;s the potential from which all of these categories Emerge and so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.590" end="00:21:01.169" style="s2">The most abstract category of our imagination is that which is beyond our understanding the category of that which is Beyond our understanding?</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.510" end="00:21:03.510" style="s2">and that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.210" end="00:21:09.509" style="s2">represented because we can only use the representational structures that we evolved is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.060" end="00:21:17.669" style="s2">represented in our paradoxical representation of the predator and the treasure that lies Beyond the perimeter is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.340" end="00:21:20.260" style="s2">perimeters of our safe</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.260" end="00:21:23.310" style="s2">Societies, so what&#39;s out there Beyond well?</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.310" end="00:21:28.409" style="s2">We don&#39;t know, but we need to know because we need always to deal with what we don&#39;t know so weirdly enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.410" end="00:21:33.899" style="s2">We have to come up with a category of what we don&#39;t know in order to start formalizing a theory about how we might</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.110" end="00:21:41.250" style="s2">Progress towards it and interact with it. It&#39;s a very paradoxical idea, and there&#39;s a paradoxical answer, right?</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.250" end="00:21:45.720" style="s2">It&#39;s the terrible predator that lurks in the unknown that also harbors something of great value</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.570" end="00:21:47.650" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.650" end="00:21:53.550" style="s2">Perfect that&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s exactly right and and I think that that is a reflection of the fact that human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.920" end="00:22:01.680" style="s2">Predator animal and prey animals at the same time so what&#39;s out there in the terrible darkness something that can destroy you?</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.050" end="00:22:06.479" style="s2">But also something that you absolutely need so how do you how do you?</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.000" end="00:22:09.780" style="s2">Prepare yourself for that, and that&#39;s the ultimate question of life</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.210" end="00:22:15.929" style="s2">It&#39;s not how do you deal with death although death is a sub component of the terrible unknown I would say it&#39;s how do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.930" end="00:22:19.229" style="s2">Deal with that which is Beyond your understanding which is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:24.359" style="s2">Manifesting itself in the world and that and that manifests itself every time you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.570" end="00:22:28.500" style="s2">categorize something and the thing escapes from the category and that happens most</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.019" end="00:22:34.229" style="s2">interpersonal relationships because people are so damn complicated you get them figured out boxed in you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.419" end="00:22:39.778" style="s2">Contract that neither of you will jump outside the box, but you jump outside the box continually</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.779" end="00:22:41.169" style="s2">And that&#39;s why a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.169" end="00:22:48.809" style="s2">requires constant negotiation and reconceptualize ation because you do not exhaust the person with your perceptual categories and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:52.589" style="s2">Of course you don&#39;t exhaust the world with your perceptual categories ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.139" end="00:22:54.669" style="s2">This is partly. Why the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.669" end="00:23:01.799" style="s2">Existentialist, or they have this concept called alienation and the idea was that human beings become alienated from their creative products?</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.139" end="00:23:05.159" style="s2">so and that is and here&#39;s why it happens, so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.980" end="00:23:07.330" style="s2">Imagine</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.330" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">Henry Ford makes the assembly line right so ford has no idea what&#39;s going to happen when he makes the assembly line like because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:17.579" style="s2">Just trying to figure out a fast way to make cars or he thinks that what he&#39;s making his cars</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.580" end="00:23:23.340" style="s2">So he thinks he&#39;s making an assembly line for cars, and he thinks he&#39;s making cars, and you think well</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.340" end="00:23:26.069" style="s2">What&#39;s wrong with that? Well first of all the assembly line absolutely?</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.860" end="00:23:29.819" style="s2">Transformed the entire planet right because it</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.370" end="00:23:33.959" style="s2">Brought in that the era of mass cheap manufacturing. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.960" end="00:23:41.519" style="s2">It&#39;s just it was way more than he thought it was and then did he make a car well a car is something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:47.699" style="s2">Hypothetically takes you relatively effectively from point a to point b. It was really a replacement for the horse and buggy</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.700" end="00:23:51.659" style="s2">I mean if the first cars looked like that they were horseless carriages</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.809" end="00:23:52.330" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.330" end="00:23:56.549" style="s2">Did he make a car well God it&#39;s God it&#39;s hard to tell what Henry ford made</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.889" end="00:24:00.299" style="s2">He made a very effective way for transforming the atmosphere, right?</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.029" end="00:24:05.429" style="s2">And the fact that it also happened to take you from point a to point B might be just completely irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:11.729" style="s2">compared to the fact that it was the internal combustion engine and its rapid distribution completely changed the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.370" end="00:24:14.370" style="s2">Constituent that you know the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.919" end="00:24:17.429" style="s2">Chemical structure of the atmosphere itself it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.799" end="00:24:19.779" style="s2">Completely transformed cities it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.779" end="00:24:26.369" style="s2">Blew out the rural community everyone moved to the cities right it made all the cities built around the automobile</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.370" end="00:24:30.120" style="s2">But then it had this tremendous political and economic significance, too</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.279" end="00:24:33.239" style="s2">So I mean part of the reason that because you think well is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.519" end="00:24:38.009" style="s2">A car is a way to get from point a to point B. But no no it&#39;s not a machine</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.580" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">It&#39;s also the embodiment of an idea. It&#39;s a very strange idea a collectivist society would have never invented the car</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.759" end="00:24:48.659" style="s2">because the car is predicated on the idea that you could own a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.210" end="00:24:55.739" style="s2">Conveyance that would get only you and only you from somewhere to somewhere else without ever asking anybody for any</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:24:57.609" style="s2">permission and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.609" end="00:25:02.218" style="s2">So the funny thing is is when you build something like that those presuppositions are built into it</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.219" end="00:25:05.429" style="s2">and then when you export that say to soviet Russia</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.559" end="00:25:10.378" style="s2">You don&#39;t get to they can&#39;t just take the car and leave the political implications behind</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.899" end="00:25:18.238" style="s2">The car the foot Mere fact that you stepped into one and drive it is an indication that you&#39;re accepting the political ideological</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.659" end="00:25:25.978" style="s2">Presuppositions that are part of the fact that that thing even exists and so well that&#39;s alienation, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.950" end="00:25:32.819" style="s2">Even something you make you think well you have control over what you make because you&#39;ve made it you understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.820" end="00:25:36.869" style="s2">It&#39;s like no, you don&#39;t you understand a tiny fraction of it you launch it out in the world man</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.869" end="00:25:42.509" style="s2">And the snakes inside of it the hydra Xinhai inside of it multiply their heads massively</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.909" end="00:25:47.128" style="s2">Constantly and you can you can&#39;t really keep track of it and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:53.459" style="s2">So even even in your relationship with create identities. You still see the re-emergence of this underlying</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.219" end="00:26:01.619" style="s2">Fundamental sub structure right even inside it&#39;s the it&#39;s the garden of eden there&#39;s always a snake inside the thing this wall did always</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.809" end="00:26:07.829" style="s2">Always all even God himself could not get rid of the snakes in the garden and partly what that means is that?</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.109" end="00:26:12.419" style="s2">You know the garden is a conceptual system. It&#39;s the conceptual system within which people</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.940" end="00:26:15.599" style="s2">Exist that Eden is a is a walled Garden</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.149" end="00:26:17.879" style="s2">Paradise means walled Garden</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.879" end="00:26:23.399" style="s2">And it&#39;s walls because a walled garden is where people live because the wall is culture and the garden is nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.399" end="00:26:28.228" style="s2">And we always live in a structure that&#39;s an amalgam of nature and culture so we set it up</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.229" end="00:26:31.049" style="s2">So it&#39;s paradisal as long as we&#39;re unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.049" end="00:26:33.329" style="s2">But we can&#39;t manage it because there&#39;s always something</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.460" end="00:26:39.629" style="s2">Chaotic that&#39;s coming in that we will interact with that&#39;s human beings you put a snake in the garden. It&#39;s the first bloody thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.629" end="00:26:43.618" style="s2">We&#39;re going to talk to and for better, or worse. It makes us conscious and awake</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.719" end="00:26:45.639" style="s2">It makes us aware of our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.639" end="00:26:53.009" style="s2">It does all sorts of terrible things to us, but it doesn&#39;t matter because that&#39;s that&#39;s the path that human beings have what chosen?</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.650" end="00:26:59.669" style="s2">Because that&#39;s the implication in that story and and it&#39;s very difficult. It&#39;s a very difficult thing to answer because</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:08.760" style="s2">We certainly choose each other for self-awareness and consciousness and intelligence, and I don&#39;t you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re choosing a mate</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.179" end="00:27:17.668" style="s2">There&#39;s an arms race in human beings. We&#39;re choosing intelligent mate, especially that&#39;s especially the case for women in relationship to men, so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.630" end="00:27:21.839" style="s2">So that the idea is that that&#39;s a choice</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:26.699" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s partly why it&#39;s Eva that makes Adam self-conscious in the garden of Eden right she offers him the apple</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.700" end="00:27:32.939" style="s2">She&#39;s the one that makes him self-conscious. I think that&#39;s actually accurate because the evidence from the evolutionary biologist</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.940" end="00:27:40.530" style="s2">Is that human sexual females sexual selection was one of the driving factors that differentiated us for Chimpanzees? It&#39;s a major factor</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.320" end="00:27:46.289" style="s2">Chimpanzee females are not selective Mater&#39;s they go into Estrus. They&#39;ll mate with anything</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:49.860" style="s2">What happens is the dominant Males Chase the Subordinate males away?</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.860" end="00:27:52.380" style="s2">And so they end up leaving more offspring</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.380" end="00:27:58.530" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a consequence of selection on the part of the females and human beings it&#39;s completely different concealed ovulation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.230" end="00:28:04.650" style="s2">Intense selection pressure from women on men you have twice as many female ancestors as you have male ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.350" end="00:28:09.329" style="s2">People can never have a hard time working that oh, there is medically, but it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.150" end="00:28:13.530" style="s2">Problematic you just think on average every woman had one child</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.440" end="00:28:17.100" style="s2">half of men had none and the other half had two and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.620" end="00:28:23.189" style="s2">That&#39;s approximately correct if you average across the entire history of human sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.710" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">So human males in particular are subject to vicious selection pressure on the part of females</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:33.269" style="s2">And I also think that&#39;s partly why nature is represented</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.059" end="00:28:39.479" style="s2">Symbolically as female among human beings because after all nature is what selects</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.480" end="00:28:43.740" style="s2">There&#39;s no better definition of Nature than that which selects</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.380" end="00:28:45.730" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.730" end="00:28:51.419" style="s2">now so so here&#39;s here&#39;s what I want to talk to you about the brain a little bit because if you make the radical case</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.419" end="00:28:54.989" style="s2">let&#39;s say that these are actually the categories of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.539" end="00:29:00.719" style="s2">We&#39;re going to say well reality is what select for the for the sake of for this for the sake of argument?</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:02.620" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.620" end="00:29:10.260" style="s2">the then are our neurological struck our physical structure should be adapted to that reality it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.750" end="00:29:11.590" style="s2">necessary conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.590" end="00:29:12.180" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.180" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">So then the question is well are they and as far as I can tell the answer to that is yes?</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.040" end="00:29:19.260" style="s2">and so we&#39;ll go through the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.050" end="00:29:26.820" style="s2">What would Neuro psychological evidence quite rapidly the first bit of evidence? Is that you have two hemispheres? Why?</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.390" end="00:29:33.299" style="s2">One deals with unknown and the other deals with the known that&#39;s Alcona and goldberg. That&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.640" end="00:29:37.349" style="s2">hypothesize completely independently of any of this underlying mythological substructure</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.350" end="00:29:40.140" style="s2">which is really important thing to note because if</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.540" end="00:29:47.399" style="s2">You&#39;re trying to determine whether or not something is true valid if it&#39;s the construct upon. Which you base your thinking are</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.830" end="00:29:48.970" style="s2">valid and true</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.970" end="00:29:54.779" style="s2">There&#39;s rules for doing that and one of the rules is you have to be able to detect the existence of the categories?</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.910" end="00:29:56.910" style="s2">using multiple methods of of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.170" end="00:30:04.230" style="s2">What using multiple methods, it&#39;s the Multi method Multi trait Matrix, technically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.420" end="00:30:09.690" style="s2">It was established as a technique by two psychologists named cronbach, cro</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.820" end="00:30:13.019" style="s2">Nb a ch, and me&#39;ll Ma eh L</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.020" end="00:30:16.830" style="s2">Paul Mele back in the 1950s which pSychologists were trying to figure out?</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.830" end="00:30:22.590" style="s2">How do you determine if something actually has an existence like anger or anxiety that&#39;s something that you could study?</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.900" end="00:30:25.650" style="s2">Scientifically, and the answer is well you have to be able to measure it</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.170" end="00:30:31.980" style="s2">Multiple ways and all those measurements have to read the same way and then the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.980" end="00:30:37.980" style="s2">what do you mean by multiple ways because it&#39;s sight and vision in sight and hearing different or</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:43.559" style="s2">Somewhat and somewhat to say, but you know you make them as different as you can manage</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:46.949" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and our sensory systems are quite different smell</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.530" end="00:30:52.769" style="s2">molecular signature sound is auditory print or you know auditory pressure you need a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.290" end="00:31:00.750" style="s2">gas around you or some liquid in order for that to occur sight uses light you know we&#39;re using different inputs that converge and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.910" end="00:31:07.529" style="s2">Allow us to say well if we get convergence information across these multiple measurements, then we&#39;ll assume that the thing we&#39;re perceiving is real</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:12.870" style="s2">We even extend that in science because we say if you take your multiple measurement system</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.870" end="00:31:15.959" style="s2">And you take your multiple multiple measurement system</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.960" end="00:31:21.329" style="s2">and then you compare them will only allow what&#39;s corn to cross both those comparisons to be real and</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.550" end="00:31:26.129" style="s2">so that&#39;s the Multi method multi trait Matrix process essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.730" end="00:31:33.270" style="s2">My sense is that you know I think that the pattern that I&#39;m describing to you is manifested itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.640" end="00:31:40.140" style="s2">evolutionarily it manifests itself at the neural in the neurological space and it manifests itself in the conceptual space and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.360" end="00:31:43.709" style="s2">probabilities of all three of those things happening at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.290" end="00:31:46.680" style="s2">without there being something valid there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.650" end="00:31:51.749" style="s2">Lessons with each level of interpretation you managed to stack on top of one another</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.360" end="00:31:54.750" style="s2">So that&#39;s that&#39;s the method well, so</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.330" end="00:31:59.129" style="s2">Let&#39;s think about the brain a little bit, and I&#39;ll tell you a little bit about how the brain works</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.100" end="00:32:02.100" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.980" end="00:32:04.300" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.300" end="00:32:06.839" style="s2">You know a lot of the stuff. I&#39;m telling you right now is quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.840" end="00:32:10.709" style="s2">Old actually most of it was worked out in the nineteen in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.750" end="00:32:14.250" style="s2">But it&#39;s been remarkably stable as far as I can tell in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.250" end="00:32:19.290" style="s2">We&#39;re filling in the details and not in every sense, but in some sense, we&#39;re filling in the details, okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.290" end="00:32:26.219" style="s2">So you take this is from Alexander, Luria who was the the greatest perhaps the greatest neuropsychologist who ever lived?</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:28.630" style="s2">He was a russian</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.630" end="00:32:33.930" style="s2">What worked mostly up to the second world war mostly on people who had brain damage and he was interested in?</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.090" end="00:32:36.090" style="s2">trying to outline the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.650" end="00:32:44.190" style="s2">Overarching picture of brain function, and so he did that partly by looking at its function</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.190" end="00:32:48.959" style="s2">But also partly by looking at its structure trying to get both of those things working simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">And so we&#39;ll go through a brief picture of how the brain works and so one of the ways of so</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.180" end="00:32:59.129" style="s2">You can you can look at the brain from front to back and you can divide it roughly into two?</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.410" end="00:33:05.639" style="s2">Sections in one section has to do with sensory processing and that&#39;s roughly the back half and one section has to do with motor</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.040" end="00:33:08.759" style="s2">Output now those things aren&#39;t as clearly</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.160" end="00:33:15.359" style="s2">Differentiated as you might think because you there&#39;s very little sensation without motor output. Maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.120" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">The part that closest to an exception is smell I would say but you at least have to breathe in</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.980" end="00:33:26.760" style="s2">You know and when an animal is actively searching on a scent trail its breathing in so it&#39;s using its motor output</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.920" end="00:33:28.830" style="s2">constantly to modify the Sensory Stream</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.830" end="00:33:34.949" style="s2">It&#39;s really difficult to dissociate the two it when you&#39;re looking at some you know it kind of feels to you like you&#39;re a passive</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:36.850" style="s2">recipient of sense data</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.850" end="00:33:40.739" style="s2">But you&#39;re no such thing your eyes are moving back and forth in</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:46.019" style="s2">Multiple ways all the time including the ways that you can control voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.020" end="00:33:52.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s multiple involuntary systems that are moving your eyes in multiple ways and really what you&#39;re doing is feeling the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.110" end="00:33:54.370" style="s2">array of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.370" end="00:34:01.770" style="s2">Electro-Magnetic of the electromagnetic spectrum with your eyes you&#39;re feeling it you&#39;re actively exploring if you&#39;re not a passive recipient at all</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.050" end="00:34:03.910" style="s2">so even in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.910" end="00:34:08.009" style="s2">Sensation you can&#39;t purely pull sensation out for motor</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.590" end="00:34:13.229" style="s2">Processing and say I&#39;m getting untrammeled unbiased sense data because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.780" end="00:34:19.830" style="s2">Look at something without focusing and you can&#39;t focus without wanting to look at something</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.830" end="00:34:25.259" style="s2">You know you can&#39;t just lie there with it. Well you could with your eyes have cross, but you know that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.620" end="00:34:32.759" style="s2">Imagine you dropped a video recorder from an airplane, and it just spun around in an unfocused Manner. Well, that&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.460" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">Sampled randomly, you know what are you going to do with that nothing?</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:42.570" style="s2">and you know you&#39;re you&#39;re concentrating on the on on the auditory stream constantly and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.450" end="00:34:47.880" style="s2">Segregating out some things and suppressing others like if you listen in the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.530" end="00:34:52.530" style="s2">you can hear</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.810" end="00:34:57.419" style="s2">Probably four or five different types of mechanical noise going on at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.390" end="00:35:00.070" style="s2">most of the time in the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.070" end="00:35:01.290" style="s2">That&#39;s silent</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.290" end="00:35:05.999" style="s2">You don&#39;t hear it like you don&#39;t hear your fridge except when it turns on or off right you zero that out</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:08.910" style="s2">And so you&#39;re very selective in your perception</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.550" end="00:35:14.729" style="s2">So you can&#39;t really technically separate out motor output from Sensory input</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.730" end="00:35:20.969" style="s2">And that&#39;s really useful to know because it destroys the idea that you&#39;re just a pet you know that there&#39;s a world of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:27.749" style="s2">Sensation out there, that&#39;s imprinting itself on you, and that&#39;s how you get your information. Which is really the that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.450" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">Presupposition of the empiricists of the raw empiricists there&#39;s a world of sense data out there you sample it randomly</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">And that&#39;s what informs like yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.970" end="00:35:38.970" style="s2">Except that you&#39;re always an active</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.490" end="00:35:40.920" style="s2">harvester of the information</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.920" end="00:35:45.240" style="s2">so you can&#39;t get rid of the interpretive structure a priori that was a manual cat by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.500" end="00:35:52.370" style="s2">Who first established out in his critique of pure reason you can&#39;t get away from the fact that you&#39;re actively harvesting the data</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:57.739" style="s2">So you can say well where is human structure come from defense data. That&#39;s sort of the blank slate idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.740" end="00:36:02.540" style="s2">It&#39;s like no wrong because a blank slate cannot process information</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:08.990" style="s2">You&#39;re actively engaged right at the beginning. So that&#39;s another example of the knower and the unknown you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.690" end="00:36:15.350" style="s2">Working in the cyclical Manner because you interact with something you divide it up into</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:17.970" style="s2">You you and the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.970" end="00:36:22.189" style="s2">Roughly speaking, and I mean you really make it that way because you build yourself out of the information</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.190" end="00:36:24.190" style="s2">And then of course that makes you a more</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.570" end="00:36:30.110" style="s2">Differentiated processor with a broader range of skills then you interact with the unknown again you Gather more information</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.600" end="00:36:33.769" style="s2">It differentiates the world it makes you a more differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.350" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">Harvester, and then so it&#39;s just continually cycling and that consciousness the logos the knower is that thing that&#39;s doing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.420" end="00:36:46.340" style="s2">Harvesting and you can never say it&#39;s not there now</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.340" end="00:36:52.789" style="s2">what happens is that it&#39;s in its nascent form to begin with Low resolution nascent form Low resolution or</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.370" end="00:36:56.719" style="s2">Low resolution Category system Low resolution world</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.970" end="00:37:04.040" style="s2">But that&#39;s enough to kick started and to started differentiating and that happens as you develop as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.650" end="00:37:10.370" style="s2">Because you start out as a single-celled organism for all intents and purposes a very low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.740" end="00:37:17.479" style="s2">Thing in a very low resolution world and that differentiates itself across time, but exactly the same thing happened over evolutionary time</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.150" end="00:37:19.320" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.320" end="00:37:25.909" style="s2">So there isn&#39;t a time when those three elements aren&#39;t there for all intents and purposes. They&#39;re always there</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.910" end="00:37:31.910" style="s2">They&#39;re permanent okay, so anyways back to the brain since sensory unit. That&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:39.080" style="s2">Back half Roughly speaking huge chunk of that is devoted to visual processing in human beings right most animals</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.210" end="00:37:46.220" style="s2">Organized around smells not us some what still can smell is a very powerful evoker of memories</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.220" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">And it has a direct</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:49.350" style="s2">relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.350" end="00:37:55.039" style="s2">Emotional systems because you need to know if something is edible or inedible terrible or or good very very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.290" end="00:37:57.529" style="s2">But human beings are organized around vision</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.530" end="00:38:01.220" style="s2">so we have a map of massive amounts of our Cortex devoted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.710" end="00:38:09.079" style="s2">Differentiated visual processing now the motor unit so what you have is each of these little zones here, so for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.840" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">Look at the back here</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:12.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.360" end="00:38:17.269" style="s2">Primary visual area and the Secondary visual area and then this is the primary auditory</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.490" end="00:38:23.569" style="s2">area in the middle of the brain here on the outside and the secondary auditory area and then the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.240" end="00:38:25.410" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.410" end="00:38:33.230" style="s2">This is for body representation the primary area in the secondary area and you can think about those those areas of primary</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.570" end="00:38:41.510" style="s2">primary Secondary and then tertiary primary does the base level processing tertiary expands that up into more abstract represent a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.940" end="00:38:47.960" style="s2">Secondary expands it up into more abstract representations and tertiary are the areas where the senses come together?</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.960" end="00:38:51.949" style="s2">And that&#39;s really what what you seem to be most conscious of right?</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.440" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s action in the tertiary areas because you don&#39;t really see the world as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.420" end="00:39:01.819" style="s2">Separate you can think about the auditory streams separate from the visual stream and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.820" end="00:39:06.710" style="s2">And you can think about touch separately, but you tend to consciously experience things as a unity</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.000" end="00:39:12.289" style="s2">As a comprehensive unity of all the senses simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.360" end="00:39:17.660" style="s2">So consciousness seems to occur only at that most of the time at the highest level of integration</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.660" end="00:39:24.589" style="s2">And you&#39;ll area would have associated consciousness more with the tertiary areas where this where the senses are talking to one another now</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.590" end="00:39:26.590" style="s2">It&#39;s more complicated than that because there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.150" end="00:39:33.980" style="s2">subcortical structures all the way down to the spine that are involved heavily in what consciousness is it&#39;s not merely a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.080" end="00:39:36.080" style="s2">consequence of cortical</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.300" end="00:39:40.850" style="s2">Activity you know we tend to think that because human beings have massively expanded</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.700" end="00:39:46.639" style="s2">Cortical structures, and we think of ourselves as the most conscious creatures, and that&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:50.180" style="s2">But you can take an awful lot of cortex off someone and they&#39;re still conscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.460" end="00:39:53.899" style="s2">In fact you can leave them with almost no brain at all, and they&#39;re still conscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.900" end="00:39:59.720" style="s2">So we really have a rough time trying to figure out what consciousness is and how it&#39;s related to brain structure</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.960" end="00:40:02.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.660" end="00:40:09.139" style="s2">Anyway, so that&#39;s the sensory and then the motor unit you have the primary</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.140" end="00:40:17.509" style="s2">Unit the secondary unit and the primo or the prefrontal Cortex and prefrontal Cortex is particularly a huge and human being so imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.670" end="00:40:21.230" style="s2">It&#39;s this primary and secondary areas that allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.049" end="00:40:29.268" style="s2">- first of all to Act voluntarily, and then - and then to play around in some sense with your actions you know like</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.180" end="00:40:37.879" style="s2">Imagine that imagine that you&#39;re a child building with legos and you can sync with the legos without without really having to think abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.130" end="00:40:43.819" style="s2">right because you can play around and build different sorts of structures until you can think at the level at A</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:47.479" style="s2">Level of motor output without having to depend on abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.549" end="00:40:50.689" style="s2">but if you develop the Prefrontal Cortex</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.000" end="00:40:56.029" style="s2">here which emerged out of the motor and premotor areas over the course of evolution so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.369" end="00:41:00.139" style="s2">Differentiation of those structures, so this is dealing with the real world</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.210" end="00:41:02.359" style="s2">This is dealing mostly with the real world</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.359" end="00:41:09.979" style="s2">But starting to abstract and experiment a little bit and then this what this part deals with abstractions pure and simple so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.589" end="00:41:17.538" style="s2">know I can I can I can lift this and then I can play with lifting it and then I can put it aside and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.819" end="00:41:19.819" style="s2">Think about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.890" end="00:41:23.779" style="s2">Abstractly I can think about all the different things that I might do with it. I say well, I could throw it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.779" end="00:41:27.079" style="s2">I could take it apart. I could throw I could toss it in the air. I could juggle it</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.079" end="00:41:32.568" style="s2">I could use it as a doorstop right I could kick it across the room and so basically what I&#39;m doing there is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.910" end="00:41:36.019" style="s2">Using my prefrontal Cortex to generate an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.390" end="00:41:43.609" style="s2">Representation of the world and then to plot out motor strategies before implementing them and that&#39;s basically what abstract thought is</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.859" end="00:41:46.729" style="s2">very very fundamentally, it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.279" end="00:41:55.279" style="s2">it&#39;s the hypothesis of abstract action and then the analysis of the outcome and then the implementation into action and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.829" end="00:42:02.119" style="s2">I think that there&#39;s something about that that actually defines the difference between intelligence and conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.579" end="00:42:07.999" style="s2">Because weirdly enough you know the correlation between intelligence and conscientiousness is zero</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.819" end="00:42:16.518" style="s2">No relationship whatsoever. It&#39;s quite strange because conscientious people plan and and so forth but I think what it is is that?</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.099" end="00:42:20.929" style="s2">intelligence is an indicator of the effectiveness of abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.539" end="00:42:27.269" style="s2">Conscientiousness is an indicator of the probability of implementation, and those are very very different problems</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.549" end="00:42:34.169" style="s2">And you don&#39;t just go from abstraction to implementation because if you did you wouldn&#39;t be able to think right the thinking has to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.630" end="00:42:39.869" style="s2">Torn away from the implementation, or what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t thinking it&#39;s just acting</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.510" end="00:42:46.109" style="s2">So and so I think that accounts for the psychometric independence of those two phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.619" end="00:42:53.219" style="s2">It&#39;s annoying because you can think of something that you should do, and you won&#39;t do it because there&#39;s no deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.829" end="00:43:01.079" style="s2">causal pathway from the conception to the action so that&#39;s kind of annoying it seems to take something like willpower in order to Transform the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.569" end="00:43:04.048" style="s2">abstraction into an implementation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.109" end="00:43:07.029" style="s2">We don&#39;t understand that very well</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.029" end="00:43:10.019" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to understand the resistance to doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.329" end="00:43:15.359" style="s2">Moke the default position of your body should be something like no it never do anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.390" end="00:43:18.390" style="s2">except eat, you know because</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.849" end="00:43:25.318" style="s2">Doing something requires the expenditure of energy and resources and so unless you have a really good rationale for it</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.319" end="00:43:27.959" style="s2">You should probably not do it and so the body is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.170" end="00:43:36.359" style="s2">Intransigent by Nature it&#39;s an oversimplification. You have to come up with a good reason to impel it into motion and you should because</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.180" end="00:43:42.930" style="s2">You have to pay for action you have to pay for it with energy and resources, so there should be resistance against it</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.930" end="00:43:49.289" style="s2">but it&#39;s still annoying so ok so that&#39;s one way of thinking about the world the world something to sense and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.539" end="00:43:53.939" style="s2">the world something to act upon and so the brain has fundamental divisions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.789" end="00:44:00.179" style="s2">Sensing and acting upon, but there, it&#39;s a constantly interacting loop. You. Can&#39;t separate them really</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.660" end="00:44:05.369" style="s2">Any more than we are separating them conceptually now</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.839" end="00:44:10.379" style="s2">on the Motor strip</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.000" end="00:44:15.000" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.230" end="00:44:20.420" style="s2">The body is represented and this was discovered at the Montreal neurological institute</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.340" end="00:44:30.680" style="s2">When when when brain surgery was been doing was being done on on on people generally who had epilepsy or some other?</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.780" end="00:44:32.760" style="s2">Terrible Brain illness</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.760" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">You have brain surgery when you&#39;re awake</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.220" end="00:44:41.090" style="s2">Which is a rather horrifying thing to know about but the reason for that generally speaking is so that?</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.210" end="00:44:44.210" style="s2">Something isn&#39;t taken out that you need</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:50.779" style="s2">Now one of the things that happened while people were having brain surgery done, and this would have been I believe I</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.330" end="00:44:53.330" style="s2">Don&#39;t remember the exact time</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.460" end="00:44:55.789" style="s2">between the 30s and the 50s, I believe</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.840" end="00:45:02.690" style="s2">And I think it was hab if I remember properly who was one of Canada&#39;s great neuropsychologist?</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.570" end="00:45:09.499" style="s2">We do brain stimulation while people were having brain surgery and they could map out the way the body was</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.720" end="00:45:14.690" style="s2">Represented on the cortical surface, and so you imagine. There&#39;s two representations. There&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.240" end="00:45:19.820" style="s2">Sensory representation of your body on the cortical Surface, and there&#39;s a motor</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.370" end="00:45:25.519" style="s2">Representation of your body on the cortical surface those are both called the representations are called homunculus</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.860" end="00:45:30.440" style="s2">They&#39;re like the body has been laid out on this strange strip, or this strip of tissue</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.510" end="00:45:33.950" style="s2">you can look up the homunculi and see what they&#39;re like, but I&#39;ll show you uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.860" end="00:45:37.249" style="s2">They&#39;re sort of stretched out weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.990" end="00:45:41.730" style="s2">along here</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.730" end="00:45:46.459" style="s2">That would be the motor one and then along here that would be the sensory one and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.010" end="00:45:53.360" style="s2">you can kind of detect with your own consciousness how your body is represented in your brain, so</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.970" end="00:45:57.380" style="s2">For example can I get you to stand up if you would?</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.290" end="00:46:00.290" style="s2">Let&#39;s turn around</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.660" end="00:46:03.410" style="s2">Okay, so how many fingers on your back?</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:12.739" style="s2">Okay, all right. Why low resolution. He&#39;s like a rope on the honor. His back is like a low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.040" end="00:46:18.019" style="s2">Array of pixels right and so it&#39;s virtually impossible. You just don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.810" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">Sensory tissue on your back to make that you could tell I was pushing</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.680" end="00:46:26.149" style="s2">But it could have been a bath it could have been five fingers. It doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.190" end="00:46:31.949" style="s2">maybe your pixel is this big or something like that right and so, but if I put a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.890" end="00:46:38.430" style="s2">Finger on your lip like that man. You&#39;ve got it right now or on your tongue because your tongue</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.430" end="00:46:42.269" style="s2">there&#39;s more representative representation of your tongue than your entire trunk and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.849" end="00:46:48.659" style="s2">Well, why well you don&#39;t to bite your tongue? That&#39;s a big problem. You have to be able to talk you</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.329" end="00:46:52.919" style="s2">You want to really differentiate what you&#39;re eating if you&#39;re eating fish?</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.920" end="00:46:56.220" style="s2">You don&#39;t want to eat the bone so and you know when your tongue is</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.220" end="00:47:01.980" style="s2">unbelievably crazily sensitive, and you know that to that if you have a tooth pulled</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.069" end="00:47:09.028" style="s2">Your tongue will investigate that area for like six months what you&#39;re sitting there your attention</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.309" end="00:47:15.538" style="s2">Wanes and your tongue is in there like mapping like mad mapping that little hole to update your body representation, right?</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.539" end="00:47:17.539" style="s2">And it&#39;s just this crazy thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.369" end="00:47:20.369" style="s2">unbelievably well</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.410" end="00:47:28.259" style="s2">Represented set from the sensory perspective and also from the motor perspective because you could manipulate your tongue like crazy. It&#39;s it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">quarter of your motor output system is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.930" end="00:47:35.519" style="s2">devoted to tongue manipulation, right and so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.430" end="00:47:39.509" style="s2">Here&#39;s a picture of the homunculus, this is a motor homunculus</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.359" end="00:47:44.609" style="s2">So that&#39;s how that&#39;s what your brain thinks of your body that that&#39;s a good way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.609" end="00:47:47.609" style="s2">And so that&#39;s what a human being is like in terms of his or her</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.680" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">Output and so what you see if you look at a sensory homunculus, it&#39;s quite similar except the feet are bigger the genitalia are bigger</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.480" end="00:48:01.259" style="s2">Logically they don&#39;t have much motor utility but they have a lot of sensory utility, but the rest of its quite similar</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.259" end="00:48:04.619" style="s2">So there&#39;s you know the motor and the sensory homunculus are quite similar</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.619" end="00:48:07.348" style="s2">But I&#39;m going to talk about the motor homunculus because it&#39;s sort of the action</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.470" end="00:48:10.470" style="s2">Representation well so what are human beings like?</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.869" end="00:48:12.869" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.480" end="00:48:17.579" style="s2">We&#39;re all hands that&#39;s the first thing you know and if you do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.069" end="00:48:24.179" style="s2">There&#39;s no, it&#39;s unbelievably high resolution your fingertips and and and the and the that sensory</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.180" end="00:48:29.759" style="s2">But we can manipulate our hands like crazy like they&#39;re unbelievably articulated, right?</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.759" end="00:48:32.729" style="s2">And that&#39;s the thing that makes us able to change the world it makes us</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.730" end="00:48:36.659" style="s2">What dolphins aren&#39;t and so a huge part of our brain is devoted?</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.240" end="00:48:41.969" style="s2">Towards being able to move our hands that enables us to take things apart put them together</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.730" end="00:48:45.459" style="s2">And then once we learn to take things apart and put them together</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.740" end="00:48:47.560" style="s2">We can talk about how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.560" end="00:48:51.850" style="s2">And that&#39;s a lot of what we&#39;re doing and that&#39;s the hands and the mouth and the tongue Roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.130" end="00:48:54.280" style="s2">Here&#39;s how I took something to get apart</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.010" end="00:48:57.879" style="s2">Chaos here&#39;s what I made out of it order</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.950" end="00:49:05.530" style="s2">Here&#39;s how I did it, and then you receive that and you&#39;re happy about it, and then you can do the same thing that&#39;s invitation</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.290" end="00:49:09.729" style="s2">Facilitated by language like here&#39;s what I did with my body. I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.730" end="00:49:12.680" style="s2">propagating the cross space</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.680" end="00:49:15.879" style="s2">You&#39;re taking it mapping it onto your body now</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.880" end="00:49:17.380" style="s2">You can do the same thing. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.380" end="00:49:20.440" style="s2">And that&#39;s you know it might be simple like this is how you pick up a rock?</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.840" end="00:49:24.850" style="s2">But it might be complicated like here&#39;s how you go after the dragon of Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.640" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">Right and so that&#39;s it sort of maps on to that hierarchy this thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.100" end="00:49:33.100" style="s2">That we talked about in some detail</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.470" end="00:49:34.609" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.609" end="00:49:40.089" style="s2">when you&#39;re telling a story to people when you&#39;re informing them about something you can talk to them at a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.250" end="00:49:42.250" style="s2">Resolution what you do with your child</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.500" end="00:49:47.560" style="s2">Here&#39;s, how you slice up some broccoli right, but then you move up the obstruction</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.560" end="00:49:50.229" style="s2">So here&#39;s how you act like a civilized person at the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.840" end="00:49:56.049" style="s2">Right and that&#39;s part of being a good person so you can tell stories about I just went and saw logan</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.050" end="00:50:00.609" style="s2">I really like by the way, it&#39;s super violent, but I really did like it. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:05.139" style="s2">Got a very elegant mythological structure. Which is not surprising, but</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.900" end="00:50:07.930" style="s2">There&#39;s a scene in this logan movie. He</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.840" end="00:50:09.980" style="s2">It&#39;s not a spoiler</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.980" end="00:50:16.300" style="s2">he has this child with him who has not been I was being raised Roughly in a laboratory and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.700" end="00:50:18.460" style="s2">She has absolutely no table Manners</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.460" end="00:50:20.450" style="s2">and so they&#39;re sitting at</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.450" end="00:50:26.109" style="s2">The dinner with some people that they run into and she&#39;s you know eating like a total barbarian and of course everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.510" end="00:50:33.850" style="s2">Eyebrows are raised like where did this person come from so the fact that that high order behavior isn&#39;t there is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.310" end="00:50:39.219" style="s2">Something that&#39;s of extraordinary interest to everyone and so you know you teach your children</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.190" end="00:50:46.240" style="s2">Microstrategy&#39;s, and you teach the macro strategies some of the macro strategies you&#39;re teaching them you don&#39;t even understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:49.570" style="s2">Because you know you know the strategies. They&#39;re built into you</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.119" end="00:50:55.689" style="s2">Because of an evolutionary process roughly speaking, and you say things like it doesn&#39;t matter whether you win</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.690" end="00:50:57.190" style="s2">Or lose it matters you play the game</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.190" end="00:51:00.190" style="s2">And you don&#39;t understand what that means although you know it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.190" end="00:51:06.790" style="s2">And you try to act that out for your children and they incorporate it in their action even though they can&#39;t represent it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.790" end="00:51:08.660" style="s2">They cannot come up with a fully</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.660" end="00:51:10.010" style="s2">articulated</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.010" end="00:51:13.810" style="s2">Representation of what that means and so they&#39;re like children piagetian children</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.930" end="00:51:22.570" style="s2">Children can only play by themselves to begin with while they&#39;re integrating themselves internally then they start to play in parallel with other children</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.570" end="00:51:29.649" style="s2">So you&#39;ll your - you play your game that child plays his or her game a little interaction, but you can&#39;t unite the games</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.290" end="00:51:31.100" style="s2">then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.100" end="00:51:36.909" style="s2">Between 2 &amp; 4 you start to be able to unite the games and you can either do that by acting them out you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.910" end="00:51:40.210" style="s2">Do this even with the younger child they can catch Peekaboo very rapidly?</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:44.350" style="s2">But once you&#39;re between 2 &amp; 4 and you start getting linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.350" end="00:51:50.620" style="s2">You can start saying well, let&#39;s play this game, and that means we&#39;re going to unite our attention towards a particular goal</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.170" end="00:51:58.600" style="s2">We&#39;re going to unite our motor activity and maybe cooperate and compete towards that goal the beginning of the social structure</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:04.510" style="s2">The beginning of the social structure and you get really good at that between 2 &amp; 4 but you don&#39;t necessarily?</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.730" end="00:52:10.840" style="s2">Know what you&#39;re doing, you can&#39;t say it so PJs experiments indicated that if you take children</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.240" end="00:52:13.929" style="s2">Maybe they&#39;ve got to the point where they can play quite a social game</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.930" end="00:52:18.610" style="s2">Maybe they&#39;re 5 or 6 they&#39;re playing marbles you take them out of the game and you say okay?</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.610" end="00:52:22.569" style="s2">Tell me the rules of the game of marbles they give incoherent representations</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.850" end="00:52:26.679" style="s2">Why because their behavior is more sophisticated than their?</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.020" end="00:52:33.340" style="s2">Representation you see as soon as you understand that that is a wild thing to understand because it answers the question for example</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:37.540" style="s2">How can you have dreams that tell you things you don&#39;t know?</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.270" end="00:52:42.310" style="s2">You think well how the hell can that possibly be you&#39;re coming up with the damn dream?</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.650" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">How can the dream tell you things you don&#39;t know or?</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.890" end="00:52:50.830" style="s2">analogously, how can people tell stories that contain information that they don&#39;t understand an</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:56.889" style="s2">Answer is the information is coded in our behavior okay, so we&#39;ll go back to a chimpanzee troop</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">All the chimpanzees in the troop know the dominant Hierarchy structure, but if you take a chimpanzee out</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.270" end="00:53:09.939" style="s2">From the troop and say what&#39;s the dominant structure the chimpanzee is going to?</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:17.290" style="s2">Do whatever a chimpanzee does it&#39;s not going to have a little conversation with you about the nature of the dominant Hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.290" end="00:53:21.999" style="s2">So it can act out its knowledge, and it might even be able to represent it an image</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.300" end="00:53:25.220" style="s2">but it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.220" end="00:53:26.600" style="s2">articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.600" end="00:53:34.329" style="s2">well, why would we be any different we aren&#39;t obviously because we&#39;re more complex than we understand so the fact that we&#39;re more complex than</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.330" end="00:53:40.059" style="s2">We understand means that we contain information that we cannot articulate. Why can&#39;t that reveal itself?</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.060" end="00:53:42.610" style="s2">It does all the time you have a revelation</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.610" end="00:53:50.829" style="s2">Aha, I get it. Well. What is that? It&#39;s maybe you&#39;re in psychotherapy, and we talk about some things about your past</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.830" end="00:53:57.580" style="s2">We say well this happened then this hop and then this happened look there&#39;s a pattern wow and it&#39;s overwhelming. It&#39;s like now</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.580" end="00:54:03.340" style="s2">There&#39;s a concordance between your knowledge and the things that you&#39;re acting out, and that&#39;s what comes as a revelation</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.560" end="00:54:10.060" style="s2">So one of the things that happens in Exodus moses is leading his people through the desert classic u-shaped story</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.060" end="00:54:14.860" style="s2">They&#39;re in eternity to begin with right, so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the insufficient present</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.860" end="00:54:21.879" style="s2">That&#39;s the old order then they cross the water the destructive water. That&#39;s Chaos like the flood then they&#39;re out in the desert</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.430" end="00:54:28.330" style="s2">Wandering without direction they start worshipping idols. They&#39;re wandering without direction and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.970" end="00:54:30.970" style="s2">Moses goes up on the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.850" end="00:54:33.879" style="s2">Which is by the way, what happens in Logan?</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.880" end="00:54:38.170" style="s2">Just because if you&#39;re going to go see it, you might as well know that because it&#39;s a journey up a mountain</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.530" end="00:54:45.909" style="s2">he goes up the mountain and he gets rules revealed to them well the way the story is structured is just ordinary interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.150" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">moses takes his people away from this peer net tyrannical structure, but they don&#39;t go from Tyranny to</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.750" end="00:54:59.560" style="s2">Paradise to the promised land in one move that isn&#39;t how it works they have to they go from eternity to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.810" end="00:55:07.149" style="s2">Absolute Chaos where everyone is fighting and killing each other and having a terrible time of it in half starving and and having to pass</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.370" end="00:55:11.199" style="s2">Through the red sea like it&#39;s they go from Tyranny to catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.630" end="00:55:16.630" style="s2">Before they go to higher order and moses doesn&#39;t even make it to the place of higher order</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.240" end="00:55:18.910" style="s2">He dies before he gets there</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.910" end="00:55:23.230" style="s2">so it&#39;s quite the catastrophe and the israelites are all confused when they&#39;re out in the desert because</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.589" end="00:55:27.339" style="s2">Even though they were in a tyranny and they were slaves now. They&#39;re nowhere, and they don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.499" end="00:55:32.978" style="s2">It&#39;s not good and so a lot of them actually start thinking about how good the damn tyranny was</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.529" end="00:55:38.679" style="s2">Compared to wandering around in the desert. Which is exactly what happened in the soviet union right in Russia now. There&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.739" end="00:55:41.739" style="s2">Nostalgia for the Stalinist, Era</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.959" end="00:55:45.909" style="s2">So these stories. They&#39;re always true. They&#39;re always happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:53.289" style="s2">So anyways what happens to moses is that the story is quite interesting so the israelites start to fight amongst themselves</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.660" end="00:55:59.410" style="s2">which of course they do because there&#39;s no higher order authority and so then moses sits and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.019" end="00:56:01.989" style="s2">Judges the like literally like a judge</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.989" end="00:56:07.509" style="s2">He sits for hours every day and the squabbling israelites come up, and say you know he did this to me</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.509" end="00:56:12.099" style="s2">And oh you did this to me and and so then moses has to figure out who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.099" end="00:56:16.808" style="s2">And he&#39;s doing this for like hours and hours for days and days for weeks and weeks for months</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.449" end="00:56:23.919" style="s2">It&#39;s like the origin of English common law it&#39;s exactly what happened with common law because in common law what happens is that?</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.380" end="00:56:28.420" style="s2">you have all the rights there are if you to have a dispute you go before the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.549" end="00:56:31.748" style="s2">Judiciary you sort out the dispute that becomes the precedent now</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.749" end="00:56:38.289" style="s2">That&#39;s part of the body of laws the body of laws is what you act out. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a body well</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.289" end="00:56:44.198" style="s2">That&#39;s what moses does so he&#39;s sitting there making judgments very very finely tuned</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.900" end="00:56:46.390" style="s2">discreet Moral judgments</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.390" end="00:56:51.789" style="s2">You know how difficult that is when two people have a dispute to try to figure out how to mediate between that you don&#39;t know?</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.789" end="00:56:53.660" style="s2">Who&#39;s lying who&#39;s telling the truth?</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.660" end="00:56:58.629" style="s2">You don&#39;t know exactly what an acceptable solution would be like it&#39;s really ridiculously hard work</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:06.459" style="s2">So he walks through this entire process of continual judicial intermediation then he goes up the mountain and what does he get?</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.859" end="00:57:08.859" style="s2">tablet a rule well, why</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.289" end="00:57:11.919" style="s2">Well he spent his ten thousand hours</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.759" end="00:57:18.188" style="s2">Investigating the structure of morality in a practical way, and it goes bang</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.679" end="00:57:21.969" style="s2">This is what we&#39;ve been doing these are the rules</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.069" end="00:57:27.698" style="s2">It&#39;s not like there&#39;s no rules to begin with and those those are opposed because that wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.829" end="00:57:35.468" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t work that way you have to take how people are extract out what the pattern of what they are is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.959" end="00:57:41.709" style="s2">Reflect that back to the well. That&#39;s that&#39;s the story of moses, and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a myth. It&#39;s a meta story</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.900" end="00:57:44.379" style="s2">It&#39;s a story about how rules come to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.900" end="00:57:48.039" style="s2">We act a certain way we have certain kinds of expectations</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.040" end="00:57:52.510" style="s2">We have certain kinds of disputes out of that a pattern a pattern way of being</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.060" end="00:57:57.880" style="s2">Emerges then we map the pattern way of being we say well look here&#39;s the rules. There&#39;s ten of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.520" end="00:58:05.650" style="s2">Or however many you want to extract right? I mean, it&#39;s a moving target in some sense don&#39;t kill other people. That&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.190" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">Don&#39;t steal what other people have order your parents, ETc, Etc</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:14.319" style="s2">I mean either you could come up with a different basic set of rules</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.510" end="00:58:19.209" style="s2">But there&#39;d be some overlap and those aren&#39;t bad to begin with course there were far more rules than that</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.210" end="00:58:21.849" style="s2">but those were the central ones and so then you might say</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.670" end="00:58:28.960" style="s2">Hey, if you took all ten of those rules, and you try to extract out one rule from them</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.840" end="00:58:34.840" style="s2">That would be at the top of the hierarchy what would that be and in western Culture the idea there?</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.840" end="00:58:38.590" style="s2">Is that do you want others as you would have them do unto you is the rule that</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.590" end="00:58:44.049" style="s2">it&#39;s the meta rule that guides all other rules sort of like the one ring in the in the lord of the rings and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.150" end="00:58:49.539" style="s2">so it&#39;s this consistent Pattern of abstraction of ethical Guidelines, so</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.180" end="00:58:51.770" style="s2">okay, so</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.770" end="00:58:55.210" style="s2">Well until that maps on - well. There&#39;s a there&#39;s a micro</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.210" end="00:58:56.750" style="s2">There&#39;s a micro level</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.750" end="00:59:02.709" style="s2">That you instruct people at and that then there&#39;s a more abstract level that you would struck them out</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.710" end="00:59:06.730" style="s2">And then there&#39;s a more abstract level well. Maybe at that point you can&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.370" end="00:59:14.380" style="s2">Directly instruct them remember in the pinocchio story Geppetto sits pinoke or the cricket Jiminy sits</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.510" end="00:59:20.499" style="s2">Pinocchio down and tries to lecture to him about what the highest level of Moral virtue is he sounds like a complete</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.560" end="00:59:24.670" style="s2">Fraud he sounds like a propaganda artist. He&#39;s a Soapbox</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.250" end="00:59:26.630" style="s2">preacher and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.630" end="00:59:30.490" style="s2">Pinocchio doesn&#39;t understand them at all why has to be acted out?</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.220" end="00:59:33.669" style="s2">now maybe as a parent you can be a model for</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.220" end="00:59:38.709" style="s2">Emulation which is so you&#39;re a model for imitation what you say matters</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.710" end="00:59:41.319" style="s2">But it doesn&#39;t say as much matter as much as what you do</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.990" end="00:59:44.769" style="s2">Maybe it would if what you said and what you did were the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.050" end="00:59:49.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the ideal situation like that&#39;s what you want to do if you&#39;re a parent if</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.430" end="00:59:54.619" style="s2">you say one act differently your kids will torture you to death and their right to do it -</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.779" end="00:59:59.748" style="s2">Because you&#39;re confused and confusing them makes them anxious and aggressive, and they will go after you</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.329" end="01:00:04.818" style="s2">Consistency consistency consistency and if you can&#39;t provide it, you&#39;ll drive them crazy</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.369" end="01:00:13.369" style="s2">So you want to bring your words and your actions into alignment right? And that&#39;s part of the development of wisdom so okay, so</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.249" end="01:00:16.249" style="s2">back to the Brain</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.089" end="01:00:23.238" style="s2">All right, so this is there it&#39;s the motor homunculus</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.729" end="01:00:28.969" style="s2">So now what I want to tell you about that is you just just think about what this thing is like</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.970" end="01:00:30.970" style="s2">It&#39;s taking the world apart</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.529" end="01:00:33.529" style="s2">And it&#39;s talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.660" end="01:00:38.839" style="s2">So that&#39;s what a human being is like and that to me that&#39;s kind of an image of the mythological hero</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.630" end="01:00:45.589" style="s2">It&#39;s the thing that can speak Magic words and take the worlds apart take the world apart now in one of the stories</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.589" end="01:00:46.579" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you today</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.579" end="01:00:52.849" style="s2">Which is the story of the anu Mulisch which is the oldest written story that we have it&#39;s a mesopotamian story</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.849" end="01:00:58.609" style="s2">And it&#39;s from the same pool of stories that the creation account in Genesis was extracted</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.609" end="01:01:05.449" style="s2">It isn&#39;t obvious what the temporal sequence was but imagine there was a pool of stories in the middle east that were of indefinite age</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.849" end="01:01:12.919" style="s2">Tens of thousands of years and and each of them were developed in a slightly different way although the themes underneath were were similar</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.019" end="01:01:19.218" style="s2">There are great parallels between the mesopotamian creation account and the first part of the creation account in Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.380" end="01:01:21.529" style="s2">So it was discovered in the late</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.380" end="01:01:25.729" style="s2">1900s and isis just destroyed a huge</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:32.329" style="s2">Treasure trove of that sort of manuscripts, so just so you know so at Nineveh</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.670" end="01:01:36.710" style="s2">so we can we can thank the war in the middle east for the destruction of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.259" end="01:01:40.279" style="s2">huge a huge treasure house of irreplaceable</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.469" end="01:01:45.349" style="s2">Human knowledge and a lot of that&#39;s happening that&#39;s happening very very frequently it&#39;s an absolute bloody</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.979" end="01:01:49.309" style="s2">disgraceful Catastrophe, so</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.309" end="01:01:57.199" style="s2">Anyway, so you know that that&#39;s the human being lips tongues hands and the face your face is also extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.619" end="01:02:00.180" style="s2">amenable to</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.180" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">Voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:03.349" style="s2">manipulation so you can learn to move</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.920" end="01:02:10.450" style="s2">Neurons in the tissue underneath your eyes that&#39;s how that&#39;s how high-resolution your face is and that&#39;s part because it&#39;s a broadcast</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.790" end="01:02:15.310" style="s2">Screen, which is why people are always looking at it right? And that&#39;s why if you watch a movie</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.310" end="01:02:19.539" style="s2">It&#39;s always concentrating on people&#39;s faces because they&#39;re just broadcasting what?</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:22.600" style="s2">They&#39;re broadcasting their stories</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.510" end="01:02:28.270" style="s2">Constantly and we&#39;re looking at their faces. What are you looking at? What are your eyes pointing at? What are you up to?</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.270" end="01:02:33.249" style="s2">What&#39;s your emotional expression? What are you going to do next? What do you think about me? Where are you going? And you&#39;re?</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.830" end="01:02:38.080" style="s2">Brought like you find someone who has had too much plastic surgery uncanny</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:43.720" style="s2">Because their face is dead because you cannot tell what they&#39;re up to there. They&#39;ve got this is aam. Be like aspect</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.720" end="01:02:47.770" style="s2">That&#39;s terrifying and people like that. Look people like that got killed</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.440" end="01:02:53.950" style="s2">That&#39;s why we&#39;re not like that or they didn&#39;t make like you want to know what that other person is up to I told you?</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.950" end="01:02:56.050" style="s2">Already that&#39;s how the whites of our eyes evolve right</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.050" end="01:02:58.050" style="s2">I don&#39;t you remember that story?</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.400" end="01:03:04.150" style="s2">gorillas don&#39;t have that distinction between the Iris and the white not like human beings and our eyes are very sharp and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.220" end="01:03:06.220" style="s2">One thing we really want to know is</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.410" end="01:03:11.560" style="s2">What are you looking at? And why what are you up to? And if I can tell what you&#39;re looking at I can infer?</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.500" end="01:03:17.619" style="s2">What you&#39;re going to do, and you want a broadcast dot well except when you don&#39;t want to broadcast it</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.619" end="01:03:20.019" style="s2">But you know most of the time you want to be pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.210" end="01:03:25.210" style="s2">Transparent to other people because otherwise they won&#39;t trust you and if they don&#39;t trust you they won&#39;t cooperate with you</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:30.129" style="s2">they won&#39;t compete with you and the probability that they&#39;ll come after you is extraordinarily high because you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.890" end="01:03:32.890" style="s2">Evil predator in no time flat</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.619" end="01:03:34.970" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.970" end="01:03:36.970" style="s2">okay, so</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.810" end="01:03:41.949" style="s2">We&#39;ll take a look at the brain from another perspective</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.760" end="01:03:47.379" style="s2">Now a lot of this I got from Alcone and Goldberg</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.130" end="01:03:50.590" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s not exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.590" end="01:03:55.749" style="s2">I had laid I laid this out before that but I found Alcone and Goldberg&#39;s writings afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.750" end="01:03:58.330" style="s2">and he was a student of larious, and he was trying to account for</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.210" end="01:04:06.340" style="s2">The why we had different hemispheres roughly speaking because it&#39;s not self-evident that we should they&#39;re actually somewhat two separate</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.800" end="01:04:08.800" style="s2">consciousnesses and they</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.960" end="01:04:13.510" style="s2">Communicate but the communication isn&#39;t complete. It&#39;s like our brain is modularized and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.910" end="01:04:19.869" style="s2">Unified at the same time and you can think about it like a me of people. Why do you want it mod your</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.420" end="01:04:24.849" style="s2">Modularized well, so if one person goes down all of them. Don&#39;t that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.609" end="01:04:28.719" style="s2">One reason so it&#39;s some separation of function</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.000" end="01:04:30.770" style="s2">Why else well?</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.770" end="01:04:38.770" style="s2">each little module can do its own creative thing independently of the others and that&#39;s useful and then there can be communication between them and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.050" end="01:04:40.099" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.099" end="01:04:47.139" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s utility and modularity and there&#39;s utility and integration and part of what we&#39;re trying to work out on the global political scene</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.140" end="01:04:53.770" style="s2">right now is how modular things should be and how integrated they should be and the European community rushed into integration and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.619" end="01:05:00.848" style="s2">That&#39;s bothering people dreadfully because they feel that the advantages of modularization have been washed away</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.240" end="01:05:04.869" style="s2">You saw that maybe they&#39;re right because you saw what happened with Greece collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.510" end="01:05:12.339" style="s2">right and Greece is very very corrupt incredibly corrupt and germany whatever else you might think about Germany is not corrupt and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.040" end="01:05:20.889" style="s2">So the EEC tried to bring Greece and Germany together that didn&#39;t work there was no unity there the modularity was actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.890" end="01:05:27.369" style="s2">Useful and the fact that Greece was so destabilized and Italy also very corrupt and spain also very corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.890" end="01:05:34.030" style="s2">Was very shaky just about brought the whole thing down it the argument is the modularity would have been better</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.670" end="01:05:40.329" style="s2">conserved well who knows right because modularity is useful and so is integration, but</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.970" end="01:05:45.579" style="s2">Full integration seems to be a mistake and so does full modularity, how do you get that right?</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.579" end="01:05:49.719" style="s2">We don&#39;t know that&#39;s why we&#39;re arguing about it and right now. There&#39;s a backlash.</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.849" end="01:05:54.549" style="s2">We&#39;re pulling away from the integration and you you can see why - because in</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.829" end="01:06:00.909" style="s2">2008 was the American economy collapsed the world economy just about collapsed that seems like a bad idea.</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.910" end="01:06:05.410" style="s2">You know you might want some some separateness so that if one system</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.900" end="01:06:09.430" style="s2">malfunctions and goes down the whole bloody thing doesn&#39;t go into flames and</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.650" end="01:06:13.329" style="s2">So we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t know how to manage that it&#39;s a really really</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.000" end="01:06:16.089" style="s2">complicated problem, so</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.000" end="01:06:20.679" style="s2">Anyways ok so how does the how does the brain work? Well the left?</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.500" end="01:06:27.399" style="s2">Roughly speaking in right handed mail and the reason that I&#39;m concentrating on Right-handed males is because</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.589" end="01:06:33.028" style="s2">they&#39;re simpler in their neurological structure when have a more complicated neurological structure and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.519" end="01:06:36.629" style="s2">Left-Handed People tend to have a more complicated neurological structure</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.729" end="01:06:44.009" style="s2">So we&#39;ll just say that we&#39;ll just go with the standard model to begin with and you can assume that the same systems are</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.289" end="01:06:45.689" style="s2">there in every person</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.689" end="01:06:51.779" style="s2">But they&#39;re not laid out on the hemispheric structure quite as neatly but they&#39;re still there so it&#39;s sort of like these are tendencies</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.119" end="01:06:54.238" style="s2">so for example if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.849" end="01:07:02.188" style="s2">so there&#39;s a tendency for the right hemisphere to specialize for what&#39;s relatively unknown and the left hemisphere to specialize for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.589" end="01:07:05.609" style="s2">Relatively mastered and you could think about it this way, too</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.559" end="01:07:10.150" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.150" end="01:07:11.890" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.890" end="01:07:14.459" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that okay, so</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.549" end="01:07:17.289" style="s2">large-scale Low-resolution</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.289" end="01:07:19.678" style="s2">abstractions tend to be the province of the right high</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.959" end="01:07:24.839" style="s2">Resolution Detailed knowledge structures tend to be the province of the left the left is linguistic</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.839" end="01:07:28.678" style="s2">That&#39;s where the detailed structures manifest themselves in articulation</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.679" end="01:07:33.149" style="s2">But the fundamental difference between the left and right isn&#39;t language versus</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.209" end="01:07:36.779" style="s2">non language the fundamental distinction is</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.929" end="01:07:42.269" style="s2">Relatively explored and mastered versus relatively unexplored and not mastered</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.269" end="01:07:47.758" style="s2">And that&#39;s both in terms of structure the right hemisphere has a less granular structure. It&#39;s less differentiated</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.249" end="01:07:54.988" style="s2">It&#39;s also responsible mostly for negative emotion especially in the prefrontal part and the reason for that is well. How do you encounter?</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.989" end="01:07:56.989" style="s2">What&#39;s absolutely unknown?</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.059" end="01:08:04.198" style="s2">Imagination and emotion right I told you that little experiment that you could do if you&#39;re alone in a house</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.199" end="01:08:06.199" style="s2">And you hear a strange noise at night?</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.309" end="01:08:07.509" style="s2">in A room</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.509" end="01:08:12.509" style="s2">Turn off the lights and put your hand in the room like your brain will just flash off monsters like mad</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.509" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">You know you&#39;ll be nervous</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:20.308" style="s2">Because that what&#39;s in that room something to make you nervous. That&#39;s a very low resolution category, right?</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.309" end="01:08:23.099" style="s2">It&#39;s like it&#39;s a it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.799" end="01:08:24.940" style="s2">indeterminate</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.940" end="01:08:30.389" style="s2">Manifestation of the Category of things that might hurt you very low resolution, but a very smart category</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.389" end="01:08:35.069" style="s2">It&#39;s like don&#39;t put your hand in there you put your hand in there, and you watch your imagination. It&#39;s like monsters</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.069" end="01:08:38.939" style="s2">It&#39;ll generate monsters like mat and that&#39;s what the right hemisphere is doing it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.609" end="01:08:42.689" style="s2">What&#39;s in there is an exemplar of the category of things that are dangerous?</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.699" end="01:08:48.479" style="s2">Here&#39;s a bunch of images of those things and that thing in there is going to partake of that essence</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.480" end="01:08:50.480" style="s2">That&#39;s and that&#39;s a very low resolution</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.280" end="01:08:57.509" style="s2">Hypothesis that&#39;s kind of what horror movies do with people you know they sort of lead them through that initial process and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.060" end="01:09:02.160" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what the right the right hemisphere seems to me to be dominated by</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.920" end="01:09:09.749" style="s2">Dominated by subcortical processes or the left hemisphere is reversed the Cortex is more or less got dominion and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:15.240" style="s2">The right hemisphere well we&#39;ll walk through this neurologically, but the right hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.760" end="01:09:22.050" style="s2">Responds Rapidly to what&#39;s unknown, and that&#39;s that subcortical the hippocampus is doing an awful lot of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.630" end="01:09:29.039" style="s2">noting a Mismatch, and then it&#39;s using the right hemisphere to to abstractly represent what the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.590" end="01:09:31.540" style="s2">possibility space is</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.540" end="01:09:37.260" style="s2">In relationship to unexpected things and then the right hemisphere is tracking that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.510" end="01:09:40.349" style="s2">Continually what those unexpected things are and coming up with</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.020" end="01:09:43.410" style="s2">models of what you haven&#39;t yet, Mastered and</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.960" end="01:09:47.970" style="s2">That&#39;s kept separate from the left hemisphere which already has functional models</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.970" end="01:09:53.519" style="s2">And you don&#39;t want to blast the left hemisphere continually with anomalous information because you blow out its structure</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.520" end="01:09:57.330" style="s2">And then you don&#39;t know what to do so the right hemisphere generates</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.720" end="01:10:03.630" style="s2">New models in some sense out of nothing and then when the time is right taps</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.940" end="01:10:07.799" style="s2">Information into the left hemisphere slowly so that it doesn&#39;t disrupt its function too much</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.800" end="01:10:12.479" style="s2">And that&#39;s a lot of that seems to happen when you&#39;re dreaming by the way it happens at night</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.000" end="01:10:18.900" style="s2">So and what happens with the dreams you think about how dreams work you might think of dreams as part of that process where?</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.240" end="01:10:24.990" style="s2">ideas come to be so they&#39;re low resolution to begin with mostly a majestic really highly emotional and</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.510" end="01:10:27.160" style="s2">Incoherent</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.160" end="01:10:29.160" style="s2">less Coherent, why</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.980" end="01:10:32.010" style="s2">You can&#39;t be coherent unless you know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.640" end="01:10:37.530" style="s2">Abcdef if that&#39;s working you&#39;ve got coherent, but if you&#39;re dealing with something</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.530" end="01:10:40.559" style="s2">You don&#39;t know you have to muck about with your category structures</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.560" end="01:10:46.740" style="s2">And that&#39;s what dreams do and you know when you&#39;re interpreting a dream one of the things you watch for is the dream</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.930" end="01:10:52.050" style="s2">the dream presents this and then this that&#39;s called metonymy by the way from a literary perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.180" end="01:10:57.450" style="s2">What that implies is this is related to this in some way why else would they be co activated?</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.790" end="01:11:05.249" style="s2">You know people say well dreams are random. That&#39;s the stupidest theory I&#39;ve ever heard like white noise is random dreams are not random</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.400" end="01:11:10.980" style="s2">They&#39;re hard to understand, but they&#39;re anything but random. They&#39;re more random than real-life</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.310" end="01:11:14.609" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s because what you don&#39;t understand is really random</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.610" end="01:11:15.340" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.340" end="01:11:18.989" style="s2">You&#39;re organized and there has to be an intermediary that sort of quasi</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.060" end="01:11:22.109" style="s2">random between them or you never get from one to the other and</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.390" end="01:11:27.029" style="s2">Dreams and fantasies myths all of that is part of that process that</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.280" end="01:11:31.259" style="s2">That stretches you out beyond what you know into the absolute unknown and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.540" end="01:11:39.540" style="s2">And your hemispheres are differentially specialized for that, so roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.080" end="01:11:43.080" style="s2">right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.900" end="01:11:47.339" style="s2">Operation and unexplored territory. That&#39;s a really good way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.380" end="01:11:50.670" style="s2">you need a system that tells you what to do when you don&#39;t know what to do a</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.830" end="01:11:53.430" style="s2">huge part of the subcortical structure is doing that too</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.980" end="01:11:56.160" style="s2">unknown freeze then what</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.800" end="01:12:00.270" style="s2">Imagine right freeze emotions imagine</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.699" end="01:12:04.169" style="s2">Then explore then differentiate then Master</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.360" end="01:12:12.029" style="s2">That&#39;s the process that&#39;s the process of learning and what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re you&#39;re transforming low resolution representations of what&#39;s frightening</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.640" end="01:12:14.999" style="s2">into high resolution representations that</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.400" end="01:12:20.699" style="s2">Enable you to master it to take the world apart and to make ingenious things out of it</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.699" end="01:12:27.149" style="s2">So there&#39;s this very cool part of the mesopotamian creation myth. So that the major hero whose name is Marduk</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.670" end="01:12:31.589" style="s2">Confronts the dragon of Chaos Tiamat whose feminine and he cuts her into pieces</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.960" end="01:12:37.560" style="s2">And he makes the world out of her pieces and one of his name&#39;s there&#39;s he had 50 60 names</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.560" end="01:12:40.769" style="s2">and I think that was those were amalgams of tribal gods and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.830" end="01:12:46.620" style="s2">one of the names was he who makes ingenious things out of the conflict with Tiamat</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.530" end="01:12:53.759" style="s2">Absolutely perfect because that&#39;s exactly what human beings do right we confront that terrible predatory</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.850" end="01:12:59.879" style="s2">Potential that lies outside our domain of experience, and we make ingenious things out of it</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.880" end="01:13:02.850" style="s2">And then we talk about how we did it and then we model</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.850" end="01:13:07.859" style="s2">How we did it and that&#39;s the basis of our ethics and our morality and the way that that ties in to think about</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.050" end="01:13:11.130" style="s2">one of the things we talked about was that the mythological hero was a</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.560" end="01:13:15.300" style="s2">Representation not of the being that was at the top of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.460" end="01:13:21.300" style="s2">But of the being that was at the top of the set of all possible dominance hierarchies okay, so here&#39;s a cool equation</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.910" end="01:13:23.999" style="s2">the Hero who goes out into the unknown to</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.700" end="01:13:31.979" style="s2">make contact with the dragon and to bring back the treasure is the same thing that wins the battle across sets of dominance hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.110" end="01:13:35.729" style="s2">That&#39;s how the two things come together right? It&#39;s so brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.730" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">it&#39;s so absolutely brilliant and so it&#39;s the mythological hero the mythological Hero is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.920" end="01:13:47.310" style="s2">Representation of what&#39;s again not at the top of one dominance hierarchy, but at the top of all of them. That&#39;s the eye</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.310" end="01:13:54.689" style="s2">That&#39;s above the pyramid why the eye because it pays attention, and that&#39;s what you do none of this is this is not</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.420" end="01:13:56.560" style="s2">fiction</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.560" end="01:13:59.850" style="s2">It&#39;s meta truth. It&#39;s the right way to think about it look</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.910" end="01:14:05.519" style="s2">Let&#39;s say you&#39;re socially anxious okay? So what happens when you&#39;re socially anxious?</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.600" end="01:14:11.820" style="s2">You go to a party your heart&#39;s beating. Why the party is a monster</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.980" end="01:14:15.270" style="s2">Why because it&#39;s judging you and it&#39;s judging you?</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.270" end="01:14:21.419" style="s2">It&#39;s putting you low down the dominance hierarchy because that&#39;s what a negative judgement is and that interferes with your sexual</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.970" end="01:14:27.059" style="s2">success and that means that you&#39;re being harshly evaluated by Nature itself</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.490" end="01:14:33.389" style="s2">Right so you are confronting that the dragon of Chaos when you go into the social situation and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.390" end="01:14:39.479" style="s2">What do you do? You like this like you hunched over and that&#39;s low dominance. I&#39;m no threat. It&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.480" end="01:14:40.780" style="s2">That&#39;s not going to get you very far</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.780" end="01:14:46.349" style="s2">You know, but that&#39;s a logical thing to do in the in the face of a tyrant so I&#39;m no threat</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.350" end="01:14:52.320" style="s2">You know you look at the king, and you&#39;re dead I&#39;m no threat. I&#39;m hunched over and then what&#39;s happening internally</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.390" end="01:14:54.180" style="s2">How are what are people thinking about me?</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.180" end="01:14:59.519" style="s2">What are people thinking about me or am I looking stupid am I looking foolish jeez I&#39;m awkward. I hate being here man</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.520" end="01:15:01.520" style="s2">I&#39;m sweating too much, it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.900" end="01:15:09.840" style="s2">Internalized right, it&#39;s all self focused the the eye isn&#39;t worked the eye isn&#39;t working. What do you tell people?</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.690" end="01:15:17.160" style="s2">Stop don&#39;t stop thinking about yourself because you can&#39;t it&#39;s like don&#39;t think of a white elephant</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.650" end="01:15:23.310" style="s2">White elephant white elephant white elephant you can&#39;t tell someone to stop thinking about something because they get caught in a loop</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.410" end="01:15:28.079" style="s2">What you do with socially anxious people is you say look at other people</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.600" end="01:15:34.890" style="s2">Look at them right why because if you look at them, you can tell what they&#39;re thinking and then you</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.170" end="01:15:40.380" style="s2">Unless you&#39;re unless you&#39;re terribly socialized and some people are some people have no social skills</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.380" end="01:15:45.029" style="s2">and so the reason they can&#39;t go to a party is because they don&#39;t even know how to introduce themselves like they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.100" end="01:15:48.720" style="s2">No one ever taught them how to behave and so they&#39;re really good</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.560" end="01:15:54.930" style="s2">Candidates for Behavior therapy because you walk them through the process of how you actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.440" end="01:16:01.620" style="s2">Manifest the procedures that are associated with social acceptability, but most people aren&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.620" end="01:16:07.890" style="s2">They have the ability so if they&#39;re really introverted and high in neuroticism. They can usually talk quite well to someone one-on-one</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.410" end="01:16:11.970" style="s2">Why because they look at them well if I look at you?</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.970" end="01:16:17.280" style="s2">It&#39;s another thing to do if you&#39;re ever speaking to a group of people never speak to the group of people</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.560" end="01:16:19.740" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t exist you talk to</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.470" end="01:16:27.119" style="s2">Individuals and then they reflect for you the entire group because they&#39;re all entrained. If you look at one person</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.520" end="01:16:32.700" style="s2">They&#39;ve broadcast to you what everyone&#39;s thinking and you know how to talk to one person, so it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.370" end="01:16:41.189" style="s2">So as soon as you focus on the person (not you) you push your attention outward use your eye push your attention Outward</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.190" end="01:16:42.870" style="s2">And you start watching well</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.870" end="01:16:48.990" style="s2">Then all your automatic mechanisms kick in and you stop being awkward because if we&#39;re talking, and I&#39;m looking here I</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.960" end="01:16:52.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to do next and I&#39;m going to put</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.500" end="01:17:01.500" style="s2">Disjunctions into the like they&#39;re like bad chords in the melody of our of our conversation because the reason is I&#39;m not paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.230" end="01:17:05.580" style="s2">So that&#39;s why the eye is the thing at the top of the pyramid it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.680" end="01:17:10.950" style="s2">The thing that enables you to win the set of all possible dominance hierarchies is the eye. Pay attention.</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.470" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">Pay attention.</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:16.470" style="s2">That&#39;s the critical issue. That&#39;s why the Egyptians worshiped Horus</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.680" end="01:17:22.409" style="s2">That&#39;s why Horus was the thing that rescued Osiris from the from the depths. It&#39;s the capacity to pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.510" end="01:17:24.510" style="s2">What do you pay attention to most?</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.330" end="01:17:32.700" style="s2">What your right hemisphere signals as anomalous. It attracts your attention it&#39;s like this isn&#39;t going quite right? I&#39;m not looking at that.</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.310" end="01:17:35.310" style="s2">Wrong!</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.350" end="01:17:40.679" style="s2">That&#39;s what you look at. That&#39;s what you look at. What not going right because that&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.679" end="01:17:45.359" style="s2">that&#39;s the terrible monster that might eat you but it&#39;s also the place you get all the information, so</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.630" end="01:17:49.019" style="s2">That&#39;s why it&#39;s useful to have discussions with your enemies</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:55.739" style="s2">Because they will tell you things you do not know and that&#39;s such a great thing because if you don&#39;t know them well</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.739" end="01:17:59.368" style="s2">You&#39;re not very smart are you you know there may be a time when you go somewhere.</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.469" end="01:18:04.018" style="s2">That&#39;s the thing you need to know and maybe your enemy will tell you why you&#39;re such a fool</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.209" end="01:18:06.659" style="s2">You know and a bunch of other things that aren&#39;t true, too</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.300" end="01:18:12.449" style="s2">But even one thing that&#39;s accurate it&#39;s like yeah, thanks very much man. Maybe I&#39;ll do some work on that</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.449" end="01:18:18.748" style="s2">I won&#39;t have to carry that forward so and that&#39;s part of the reason again. Why the terrible predator,</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.749" end="01:18:24.148" style="s2">It&#39;s always the terrible predator that has the gold it&#39;s like the person who delivers the message you do not want to hear</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.429" end="01:18:26.429" style="s2">So it&#39;s rough, it&#39;s rough</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.530" end="01:18:28.919" style="s2">But it doesn&#39;t matter who life is rough</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.439" end="01:18:30.999" style="s2">okay, so</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.999" end="01:18:32.499" style="s2">How are these</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.499" end="01:18:34.499" style="s2">specialized?</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.079" end="01:18:39.779" style="s2">The right hemisphere operation and unexplored territory and that unexplored territory</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.570" end="01:18:47.759" style="s2">Emerges when ever what you&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t work you know you can conceptualize it as that which is Beyond the walls of the city</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.399" end="01:18:50.399" style="s2">But the City is a category structure</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.889" end="01:18:52.510" style="s2">abstractly...</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.510" end="01:18:54.510" style="s2">abstractly put.</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.969" end="01:19:02.638" style="s2">There&#39;s no difference between the barbarians that invade the walled city and the things that happen in the world that damage your category structure</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.769" end="01:19:05.609" style="s2">They&#39;re, they&#39;re the same thing from up from a practical perspective</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.959" end="01:19:17.129" style="s2">Okay, right hemisphere operation and unexplored territory negative emotion inhibition of Behavior</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.380" end="01:19:22.949" style="s2">That&#39;s this that&#39;s anxiety that&#39;s what happens when the Medusa looks at you you turn the stone, right?</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.949" end="01:19:30.148" style="s2">That&#39;s the basilisk in Harry Potter. It freezes you why you&#39;re moving forward according to a schema. If you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.639" end="01:19:34.288" style="s2">forward properly you&#39;re getting to where you want to go and the schema is being validated.</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.959" end="01:19:40.739" style="s2">Simultaneously, I&#39;m moving for it and the map is correct something happens that&#39;s unexpected. What should you do?</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.739" end="01:19:43.059" style="s2">Stop.</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.059" end="01:19:47.849" style="s2">What else you going to do? You stop first then the predator can&#39;t see you, right?</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.849" end="01:19:50.038" style="s2">That&#39;s the freezing reaction of a prey animal</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.439" end="01:19:55.649" style="s2">So it&#39;s it&#39;s it built very very deeply into very very old circuits</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.650" end="01:20:00.089" style="s2">do that. Fact if it&#39;s a real orienting reflex to something that&#39;s a anomalous you&#39;ll go like this</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.150" end="01:20:05.789" style="s2">And that&#39;s to stop the thing that will jump on your back from carrying out your throat, and that&#39;s really really fast</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.000" end="01:20:08.429" style="s2">It&#39;s almost as fast as spinal sneak</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.950" end="01:20:16.139" style="s2">Reflex circuitry extraordinarily fast and but you know that&#39;s conserved over an evolutionary span that predator</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.720" end="01:20:22.079" style="s2">Defense system is at the bottom of your cognitive apparatus everything be built on that like</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.760" end="01:20:26.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a low-resolution pattern a</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.220" end="01:20:32.130" style="s2">Higher-resolution pattern that&#39;s the same pattern is built on top of that. Then a higher-resolution</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.380" end="01:20:37.829" style="s2">pattern that&#39;s the same pattern is built on top of that so on. But that initial architecture is</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.710" end="01:20:42.449" style="s2">duplicated across the levels of differentiation of the nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.450" end="01:20:47.789" style="s2">That&#39;s partly why these symbols can be so archaic and still be accurate it&#39;s still the way the world works.</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.640" end="01:20:55.110" style="s2">Negative emotion inhibition of behavior image processing right because image thing about images is they&#39;re fast</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.810" end="01:21:00.060" style="s2">You know a picture is worth a thousand words. Okay, you get the picture</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.220" end="01:21:04.949" style="s2">You know get the picture is actually something you say to someone if you say; Do you understand?</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.380" end="01:21:09.809" style="s2">Right if you get the picture is very very fast so the right hemisphere manages that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.540" end="01:21:14.730" style="s2">Holistic thinking that&#39;s that low resolution thinking that generalizes across instances.</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.980" end="01:21:18.899" style="s2">Pattern recognition, pattern generation, and gross motor action. yeah.</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.510" end="01:21:25.800" style="s2">Freeze and get the hell out of there that&#39;s gross motor action right hemispheres very good at that. That&#39;s why if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.620" end="01:21:27.760" style="s2">Right-Handed</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.760" end="01:21:35.280" style="s2">User if you&#39;re right-handed you use your left hemisphere to manage the really fine motor details</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.280" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">Right you write with it you write with it and because that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.680" end="01:21:45.990" style="s2">If you&#39;re right-handed you tend to use your left hand to open the top of jars</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.870" end="01:21:49.680" style="s2">Right you&#39;re use your left hand. That&#39;s a gross motor action</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.710" end="01:21:56.129" style="s2">I mean sometimes people are more lateralized than that, but the left hemisphere is specialized for the fine-grain things that you know very well</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.130" end="01:22:03.779" style="s2">That&#39;s that&#39;s exactly it. Okay the left hemisphere while the left hemisphere which is associated with positive emotion by the way</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.300" end="01:22:05.640" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.640" end="01:22:07.590" style="s2">specialized for operation in explored territory.</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.590" end="01:22:12.059" style="s2">So now what we might say is that you spend your whole life try not to have your right hemisphere turn on</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.570" end="01:22:20.579" style="s2">Because why would you want that that&#39;s where the monsters pop up. So you stay in explored territory, but maybe you also</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.280" end="01:22:27.630" style="s2">tentatively expand its borders and the left hemisphere seems to be involved in that too. So if you&#39;re curious about something</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.630" end="01:22:29.630" style="s2">It&#39;s usually something usually</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.460" end="01:22:32.610" style="s2">Something minor enough so that it won&#39;t blow your entire</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.890" end="01:22:40.110" style="s2">Category structure if you explore it now sometimes you get unlucky and you&#39;re like Eve in the garden of Eden. You go have a little</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.240" end="01:22:42.929" style="s2">chat with this little snake that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.660" end="01:22:46.649" style="s2">of no significance whatsoever and it feeds you something</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.230" end="01:22:49.470" style="s2">the apple, it feeds you something and bang</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.080" end="01:22:55.830" style="s2">Everything falls apart. Right. You collapse and you&#39;re out there in history. You&#39;re no longer in your old paradise</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.410" end="01:22:58.410" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.720" end="01:23:00.720" style="s2">activation of behavior yeah, well that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.180" end="01:23:06.899" style="s2">Positive emotion is associated with movement forward like if you&#39;re where you want to be and things are going well</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.480" end="01:23:11.550" style="s2">then your behavior should be activated so that you go and get things now one of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.950" end="01:23:17.669" style="s2">Negative consequences of that is that if you&#39;re really in a good mood really happy you&#39;re going to be impulsive and make mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.100" end="01:23:20.100" style="s2">You know because you hear these doe headed</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.890" end="01:23:22.810" style="s2">That&#39;s a very minor word</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.810" end="01:23:29.160" style="s2">People who are always pushing happiness as the as the key measure for for successful existence. It&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.450" end="01:23:35.309" style="s2">Ill informed that it&#39;s embarrassing that that even happens</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.040" end="01:23:41.790" style="s2">Positive emotion makes people impulsive. Maniacs for example. Which is really if you that&#39;s mania, right?</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.340" end="01:23:45.419" style="s2">Bipolar disorder if you&#39;re manic you&#39;re one happy person</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.120" end="01:23:49.470" style="s2">Way to happy everything is great nothing</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.470" end="01:23:53.880" style="s2">But wonderful things that are beyond your imagination are going to happen to you</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.880" end="01:23:57.719" style="s2">And they&#39;re going to happen fast and so you&#39;re down to the mall to buy everything</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.790" end="01:24:02.790" style="s2">You can possibly get your hands on because you have a hundred uses for everything and then a week later</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.890" end="01:24:05.340" style="s2">You know you crash into your depressive</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.160" end="01:24:09.869" style="s2">Episode and you realize that you&#39;re 150 thousand dollars in debt</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.870" end="01:24:15.780" style="s2">And you&#39;ve alienated everyone that you know it&#39;s like that&#39;s untrammeled positive emotion. So how about no. a</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.130" end="01:24:24.330" style="s2">peer index of positive emotion is no way of determining whether or not a system is working properly even your own system</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.330" end="01:24:30.539" style="s2">You need a balance between positive and negative emotions plus positive emotions are absolutely exhausting</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.030" end="01:24:36.180" style="s2">Because if you&#39;re in a manic episode, it&#39;s like, it&#39;s time to get everything good right now fine</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.180" end="01:24:41.970" style="s2">But you won&#39;t sleep for a week, and then you die because you just burned yourself to a crisp and so to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.240" end="01:24:44.440" style="s2">overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.440" end="01:24:49.259" style="s2">Enthusiastic about everything sounds like a real blast and I&#39;ve seen full-blown manic, so they&#39;re having plenty of fun</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.260" end="01:24:54.120" style="s2">But it is not a pleasant thing to behold. They&#39;re just all over the place and</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.850" end="01:24:56.200" style="s2">ya know</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.200" end="01:25:03.419" style="s2">Yeah, it&#39;s really not to it. It&#39;s really not good, it&#39;s really not good you need a balance between these two systems because the whole world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.210" end="01:25:08.790" style="s2">Explored territory bursting with nothing but promise that&#39;s not the world.</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.250" end="01:25:15.779" style="s2">The world is that in the bounded space a little bit with that absolute horror show going out</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.120" end="01:25:22.289" style="s2">around the periphery and both of your both systems need to be active in order to keep you balanced</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.020" end="01:25:24.850" style="s2">people do unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.850" end="01:25:27.749" style="s2">sustained damage sometimes to the left Prefrontal Cortex</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.300" end="01:25:31.560" style="s2">responsible for positive emotion or the right Prefrontal Cortex</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.840" end="01:25:36.120" style="s2">responsible for negative emotion and if you sustained right hemisphere prefrontal damage</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.120" end="01:25:39.629" style="s2">It makes you inappropriately happy and impulsive and you and your life</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.630" end="01:25:44.759" style="s2">Just goes you just spiral Downhill because you make nothing but impulsive decisions</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.760" end="01:25:47.910" style="s2">And you know what the real world consequence of that is you know?</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.940" end="01:25:51.120" style="s2">Get drunk and be impulsive for one night</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.120" end="01:25:55.529" style="s2">You can learn what the bloody consequences of that are you try living like that for a month?</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.170" end="01:26:01.290" style="s2">Independently of IQ that&#39;s the other thing that&#39;s so interesting you can blow out your left prefrontal</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.510" end="01:26:05.400" style="s2">Cortex and not suffer much of a decrease especially in crystallized intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.980" end="01:26:08.129" style="s2">but the fact that you&#39;re running on nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.680" end="01:26:14.759" style="s2">Sorry, you&#39;re right hemisphere you&#39;re running on nothing, but positive emotion. It&#39;s going to order you right into the ground and then if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.490" end="01:26:19.139" style="s2">Perhaps even more unlucky and you lose the left prefrontal</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.170" end="01:26:22.589" style="s2">Cortex, then you&#39;re permanently depressed</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.380" end="01:26:25.380" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.160" end="01:26:28.930" style="s2">the unexplored</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.930" end="01:26:32.309" style="s2">manifesting itself we know that if you take depressive depressed people and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.099" end="01:26:35.979" style="s2">Do EEG analysis that they have predominant lefting</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.739" end="01:26:41.529" style="s2">predominant resting right hemisphere EEG activation and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.920" end="01:26:45.699" style="s2">So that&#39;s roughly. So why is this? Well,</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.280" end="01:26:51.310" style="s2">unknown territory known territory you think well is that real? Well, It&#39;s real enough</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.310" end="01:26:54.159" style="s2">So that&#39;s how your brain evolved that seems pretty damn real</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.409" end="01:26:58.328" style="s2">So then we could think about it subcortically and we might as well do that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.989" end="01:27:05.859" style="s2">This is mapped out on the hippocampus more most particularly by Jeffrey Gray who is influenced by?</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.500" end="01:27:08.649" style="s2">Sokolov and vinegared Ova</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.650" end="01:27:15.159" style="s2">who are also students of Luria. Jeffrey Gray used cybernetic theory that was developed by Norbert Wiener and</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.739" end="01:27:17.659" style="s2">which is an AI</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.659" end="01:27:20.529" style="s2">which he is the father of artificial intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.349" end="01:27:23.300" style="s2">Some of that was actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.300" end="01:27:28.210" style="s2">integrated as well in to Piagetian thought because Piaget and Wiener, Er Norbert Wiener and</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.760" end="01:27:33.639" style="s2">Luria if I remember correctly all went to the same conference back in the early 1920s</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.130" end="01:27:40.000" style="s2">Mid 1920s and heard Norbert Wiener speak so that&#39;s how cybernetics theory got built into some of these underlying</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.060" end="01:27:44.169" style="s2">Theories and sort of manifested itself everywhere so Gray</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.659" end="01:27:49.269" style="s2">Gray uses a model very much like this derived from cybernetic theory and so here&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.270" end="01:27:52.029" style="s2">How does the brain work you have a target in mind?</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.599" end="01:27:55.599" style="s2">and you act to</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.760" end="01:27:59.650" style="s2">to manifest the target you act to transform the world into the target and</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.869" end="01:28:05.499" style="s2">Then you compare the consequence of your actions to the target and if they matched and that&#39;s a good thing and if they don&#39;t match</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.500" end="01:28:08.049" style="s2">Then that&#39;s what where negative emotion comes from. Okay,</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.050" end="01:28:14.949" style="s2">So how does that work the hippocampus seems to be central to that, so it detects Mismatch so so in the classic</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.469" end="01:28:22.118" style="s2">Behavioral theory, so this would be Gray&#39;s theory you have your expectations of the world that would be your model</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.119" end="01:28:28.629" style="s2">And you have your sensory input which is the real world and then the hippocampus is mapping one on to the other</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.210" end="01:28:34.929" style="s2">One from a top-down stream one from the bottom up stream and saying Match Match Match match</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.119" end="01:28:41.649" style="s2">And as long as everything matches then the hippocampus (this is an oversimplification) keeps the subcortical</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.230" end="01:28:46.509" style="s2">emotional systems inhibited because you don&#39;t need them except for maybe mi</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.020" end="01:28:50.379" style="s2">mild positive emotion to keep you moving forward if there&#39;s a mismatch</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.620" end="01:28:54.189" style="s2">That&#39;s anxiety the anxiety system gets</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.500" end="01:28:59.379" style="s2">Disinhibited because it&#39;s so on it doesn&#39;t get activated gets disinhibited that freezes you and all the other</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.510" end="01:29:03.999" style="s2">motivational systems are primed because God only knows what you&#39;re going to have to do next okay, so</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.580" end="01:29:06.080" style="s2">then if</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.080" end="01:29:07.310" style="s2">You make a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.310" end="01:29:13.660" style="s2">Given that scheme you have to modify the world in order to rectify the mistake you have to modify your motor output so that you</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.660" end="01:29:16.959" style="s2">Put the world back in order, and that&#39;s basically Gray&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.300" end="01:29:22.779" style="s2">But Gray&#39;s model is insufficient because Gray presumes that what you&#39;re comparing</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.480" end="01:29:26.709" style="s2">Your expectation with is the real world</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.220" end="01:29:33.789" style="s2">but you don&#39;t have access to the real world what really happens is that your brain compares the model of</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.400" end="01:29:35.210" style="s2">the World</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.210" end="01:29:41.740" style="s2">That you want to have happen so it&#39;s desired and not expected with the model of the world that you think is happening</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.810" end="01:29:43.300" style="s2">They&#39;re both models</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.300" end="01:29:45.850" style="s2">There&#39;s no direct contact with the truth</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.850" end="01:29:51.819" style="s2">And so what that means and this is what&#39;s horrible about this is that if your model fails..</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.820" end="01:29:54.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t only mean that you have to adjust</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.530" end="01:29:59.500" style="s2">your expectation and change your motor activity it means you might have to bloody well retool your</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.140" end="01:30:06.189" style="s2">perceptions. Well that&#39;s a lot more horrifying than just having to change your motor output if you betray me</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.800" end="01:30:12.430" style="s2">Then I have to see you differently, and you know if we&#39;ve interacted a long time</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.430" end="01:30:14.919" style="s2">I&#39;ve built up a hell of a model of you</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.920" end="01:30:17.410" style="s2">You know it&#39;s taken a tremendous amount of effort to generate</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.410" end="01:30:22.180" style="s2">And I may have used that model as a predicate for all sorts of other plans</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.180" end="01:30:29.049" style="s2">Which is what you do with an intimate relationship, and so then if you do something that indicates a true mismatch</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.090" end="01:30:31.870" style="s2">It isn&#39;t only that I have to adjust my actions</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.510" end="01:30:37.479" style="s2">God only knows what I&#39;m going to have to retool. I may even have to retool my perceptions of myself</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.610" end="01:30:40.270" style="s2">I&#39;m a lot more gullible than I thought I was for example</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.280" end="01:30:46.450" style="s2">And God only knows what the implications of that are if you&#39;re close to me, and you could do this to me</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.750" end="01:30:54.850" style="s2">Is that my flaw and environment am I carrying that into other relationships? It&#39;s an absolute catastrophe, and so Gray actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.460" end="01:31:01.539" style="s2">underestimated the degree of severity of Mismatch because he only said well it was motor output and and</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.359" end="01:31:04.989" style="s2">re re-world adjusting that would have to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.209" end="01:31:10.539" style="s2">Repaired not perception because like most behavior see the behaviorist had this idea of stimulus, right?</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.879" end="01:31:14.169" style="s2">The stimulus produces the response it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.839" end="01:31:17.169" style="s2">What stimulus well they never went there?</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.239" end="01:31:19.779" style="s2">They just assumed that the stimulus spoke for itself</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.119" end="01:31:23.409" style="s2">But it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s the fundamental weakness of behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.689" end="01:31:27.219" style="s2">Theory is that the reason they could get rid of the mind was because they hid it</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.679" end="01:31:32.378" style="s2">Invisibly inside the idea of the stimulus which is all of a sudden not just something that was a sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.050" end="01:31:37.659" style="s2">Like a piece of sense data, but that had motivations built into it well no.</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.269" end="01:31:41.049" style="s2">No. You can&#39;t do that. The</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.570" end="01:31:46.599" style="s2">Motivation you can put the motivation in the object, but then it&#39;s no longer an object. It&#39;s something completely different</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.579" end="01:31:52.058" style="s2">Ok good. Let&#39;s stop there when you come back</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.059" end="01:31:55.628" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you a bunch of stories ok so it will break for 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.469" end="01:32:04.509" style="s2">so imagine what happens when a civilization develops and it develops out of an amalgam of tribal organizations and</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.539" end="01:32:07.958" style="s2">so each of those tribes has their own god</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.959" end="01:32:13.898" style="s2">which is their own sort of imaginative universe and their attempt to make sense out of the Moral landscape of being and</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.050" end="01:32:17.050" style="s2">underneath all of those</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.239" end="01:32:22.868" style="s2">representations is a pattern and the reason there&#39;s a pattern there is because all of those tribes are made up of people and</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.089" end="01:32:29.739" style="s2">so there&#39;s going to be it&#39;s like there&#39;s a domain within which variation is going to occur so if we&#39;re going to set up a</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.379" end="01:32:34.329" style="s2">Structure that works across time it&#39;s going to at least be roughly</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.609" end="01:32:39.129" style="s2">Predicated on the same structures that a dominance hierarchy is predicated on it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.349" end="01:32:45.489" style="s2">Predicated on the same patterns of interactions that would characterize a chimpanzee troop you know. There&#39;s this basic biological</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.469" end="01:32:49.539" style="s2">What would you call it?</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.539" end="01:32:56.079" style="s2">There&#39;s a realm of biological necessity that constitutes the boundary space within which human interactions that have to take place</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.079" end="01:33:00.159" style="s2">I mean, I can&#39;t be so violent that I kill everyone in my tribe</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.409" end="01:33:06.038" style="s2">That&#39;s not to be very helpful because I&#39;m a tribal creature so without the tribe what am I going to do and?</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.169" end="01:33:08.169" style="s2">So I have to be vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.329" end="01:33:14.639" style="s2">Acceptable to other people because otherwise they&#39;ll kill me even if I&#39;m really really powerful. They&#39;ll take me down and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.190" end="01:33:17.910" style="s2">Because I have to deal with you and you and you and you and you?</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.280" end="01:33:24.869" style="s2">we&#39;re going to modify each other continually and and within parameters now the parameters are wide but they&#39;re not non-existent and</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.300" end="01:33:27.509" style="s2">You know you can see what those parameters are</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.910" end="01:33:34.260" style="s2">Genuinely if you look at a something like a wolf pack or a chimpanzee troop because those are stable across really</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.660" end="01:33:40.530" style="s2">The structure itself is stable across at least hundreds of thousands of years if not millions of years</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.530" end="01:33:43.409" style="s2">And so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.050" end="01:33:47.099" style="s2">Frans De Waal shows for example that with the chimpanzee troops</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.880" end="01:33:50.770" style="s2">if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.770" end="01:33:56.070" style="s2">He studied them mostly at the Arnhem Zoo, and I would recommend his writings. Highly De Waal. De</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.980" end="01:33:58.980" style="s2">Waal</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.020" end="01:34:04.860" style="s2">He&#39;s interested in the in prototypical Moral, behavior among Chimpanzees. It&#39;s a very interesting study and</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.770" end="01:34:09.450" style="s2">what he showed for example is that if you have a particularly the</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.150" end="01:34:17.189" style="s2">Dominant dominance Hierarchy in Chimpanzees is male there&#39;s a female dominance Hierarchy to that overlaps the male and some of the females are more dominant</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.190" end="01:34:18.610" style="s2">than many of the males</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.610" end="01:34:26.369" style="s2">But the fundamental structure looks like it&#39;s patriarchal roughly speaking among chimpanzees if you put a really rough tough</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.770" end="01:34:34.590" style="s2">Barbaric Brutal dictator Chimpanzee at the top his his reign tends to be unstable and violent because he isn&#39;t good at</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.780" end="01:34:36.190" style="s2">negotiating</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.190" end="01:34:38.020" style="s2">Social support and</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.020" end="01:34:42.390" style="s2">so he doesn&#39;t have any and so that means two chimpanzees that are</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.760" end="01:34:46.229" style="s2">friends can take him out and so that&#39;s what happens and so the</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.900" end="01:34:49.799" style="s2">Despot Chimp is an unstable leader and</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.440" end="01:34:53.640" style="s2">De Waal has shown that the more stable chimp leaders are more</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.850" end="01:35:00.300" style="s2">Chimpanitarian? I guess would be the right word. It&#39;s not humanitarian. They they do</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.850" end="01:35:02.970" style="s2">They have friends and you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.880" end="01:35:09.299" style="s2">Friendship is predicated on reciprocity even among Chimpanzees, and so if a</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.940" end="01:35:17.220" style="s2">Predicate of power is reciprocity then that&#39;s one of the things that alleviates the dictatorial tendency so anyways</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.220" end="01:35:19.220" style="s2">so my point is</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.390" end="01:35:21.390" style="s2">when a great civilization</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.400" end="01:35:27.599" style="s2">Emerges Emerges from the amalgam of tribal groups, but and each of the tribal groups has their ethic, but that ethic</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.239" end="01:35:35.249" style="s2">Isn&#39;t the ethics aren&#39;t entirely separate from one another that&#39;s why tribes can trade because they do trade They</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.889" end="01:35:38.159" style="s2">interact with one another. It&#39;s kind of half...</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.860" end="01:35:40.360" style="s2">I remember</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.360" end="01:35:41.889" style="s2">here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.889" end="01:35:42.969" style="s2">heretofore</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.969" end="01:35:48.448" style="s2">Separated tribes begin to trade because you don&#39;t know you meet each other across the river</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.449" end="01:35:52.169" style="s2">It&#39;s like you got your bows and arrows and someone makes a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.170" end="01:35:57.869" style="s2">And it&#39;s like warfare and so but you don&#39;t want to start the damn war because maybe you&#39;ll die</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.869" end="01:36:02.219" style="s2">so you&#39;re sitting there with your bow and arrows watching these guys and now you know they&#39;re there and</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.409" end="01:36:04.679" style="s2">So then you go back to your tribe</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.679" end="01:36:08.609" style="s2">And you think oh man what the hell are we going to do about this and one solution is well</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.610" end="01:36:10.349" style="s2">Let&#39;s find out where they are and then we&#39;ll go in there at night</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.349" end="01:36:14.459" style="s2">Well like well kill a bunch of them or we&#39;ll wipe them out or something like that another solution might be</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.739" end="01:36:20.339" style="s2">did you see all the neat stuff they had and so then what do you do is you find a border area and</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.920" end="01:36:24.599" style="s2">You go, and you put some things out there that are valuable and you run away</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.599" end="01:36:26.369" style="s2">And then you watch from the trees</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.369" end="01:36:31.679" style="s2">And you see what happens when these other people discover these valuable things that you left there</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.679" end="01:36:36.359" style="s2">And if they&#39;re like little on the psychopathic side they pick it all up and giggle and run away</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.360" end="01:36:40.259" style="s2">And that&#39;s the end of that, but if they have any sense what they do is</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.260" end="01:36:42.210" style="s2">They leave some cool stuff on the ground, too</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.210" end="01:36:45.869" style="s2">And then they run off and then you can go pick up their cool stuff and leave</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.869" end="01:36:48.929" style="s2">And then it&#39;s like step one in the trust process</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.929" end="01:36:54.029" style="s2">And then maybe you do that you know for a year and it starts to fall into a cadence</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.030" end="01:36:58.889" style="s2">And then maybe you know you get a little closer when you&#39;re watching watching in the bush</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.889" end="01:37:03.118" style="s2">And then maybe one day you have enough courage to kind of come you send your biggest ugliest guy out there</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.119" end="01:37:04.389" style="s2">And you know they&#39;d do the same</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.389" end="01:37:08.669" style="s2">And you know they look at each other and finally they shake hands or something like that and trade?</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.670" end="01:37:12.989" style="s2">And then well then you&#39;ve got a trading relationship established and so you can see in that</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.690" end="01:37:17.190" style="s2">The emergence of a what would you call it negotiated?</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.980" end="01:37:24.989" style="s2">Consensual Moral structure that allows trading to take place, and there&#39;s going to be rules Emerge right away</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.989" end="01:37:26.989" style="s2">Which is well, you better leave me</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.190" end="01:37:34.139" style="s2">Something that&#39;s of approximately equal value, or are not going to play the game again. That&#39;s the thing. That&#39;s so cool</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.139" end="01:37:38.219" style="s2">is that if we only play a game once I can do whatever I want and</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.980" end="01:37:43.780" style="s2">So that&#39;s that&#39;s what psychopaths do they play with game once and then they go play with someone else</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.000" end="01:37:50.500" style="s2">But if we&#39;re going to play the same game over and over and over it&#39;s like the dominance hierarchy across time</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.630" end="01:37:55.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a different rule for playing a game once than there is for playing a game a thousand times and</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.630" end="01:37:58.630" style="s2">if we&#39;re in a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.640" end="01:38:03.879" style="s2">The game we want to play is one that can be duplicated a thousand times, and there&#39;s really tight constraints on that</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.880" end="01:38:06.819" style="s2">And so that&#39;s the origin that you could consider that</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.460" end="01:38:08.750" style="s2">the Biological</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.750" end="01:38:16.120" style="s2">It&#39;s not even biological exactly. It&#39;s predicated in biology, but it&#39;s a consequence of continual interaction the ethic emerges</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.120" end="01:38:19.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like the rats that I told you about that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.880" end="01:38:22.930" style="s2">Rats that play with each other the big rat has to let the little rat win</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.030" end="01:38:28.839" style="s2">Thirty percent of the time or the little rat won&#39;t play anymore and so because the little that that&#39;s the biological</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.690" end="01:38:36.819" style="s2">The biological framing the limitation is the little rat doesn&#39;t want to lose all the time that just produces negative emotion. It&#39;s not fun</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.820" end="01:38:44.680" style="s2">It&#39;s not motivating. So why would the little rats go play again? So the the constraint on our interactions are our biological?</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.200" end="01:38:52.720" style="s2">Constraints, and they manifest themselves in the patterns way across time and there isn&#39;t any difference between you and me interacting across time</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.270" end="01:38:59.680" style="s2">Then there is between you and me acting say in the next hour so with everyone in this room. It&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.680" end="01:39:07.030" style="s2">It&#39;s just continual human interactions, and ethic emerges from that. Now different groups are going to code that ethic differently</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.030" end="01:39:09.030" style="s2">So they&#39;re going to come up with different imagistic</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.380" end="01:39:11.380" style="s2">representations and different stories</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.930" end="01:39:14.769" style="s2">Now one of the things they&#39;re trying to figure out is</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.130" end="01:39:20.740" style="s2">Well, let&#39;s do it. Let&#39;s do it in the tribal way you have to do this inside the tribe, too</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.610" end="01:39:25.390" style="s2">You have a hundred people and 10 of them are</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.970" end="01:39:29.740" style="s2">Leaders in one way or another and then out of that 10 you think well</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.740" end="01:39:31.490" style="s2">Who&#39;s the who&#39;s the best person?</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.490" end="01:39:36.909" style="s2">So you have to have a hierarchy of value to determine what the most important aspect of the ethic is</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.160" end="01:39:40.479" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be something like trust because that&#39;s the predicate for</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.000" end="01:39:42.950" style="s2">continued interaction</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.950" end="01:39:50.950" style="s2">Trustworthiness, it&#39;s not any really really any different than honesty. It&#39;s not really any different from telling the truth. So there&#39;s a really powerful</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.520" end="01:39:58.089" style="s2">Necessity for honesty to merge as a as a canonical value caring might Emerge</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.739" end="01:40:05.949" style="s2">Power might Emerge right the ability to Exert physical power especially in places</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.950" end="01:40:11.589" style="s2">Where war is a continual is continually likely and in lots of tribal landscapes? It&#39;s just non-stop</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.200" end="01:40:18.099" style="s2">Tribal trade and warfare so but but you can see how different ethics would emerge as canonical</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.500" end="01:40:24.549" style="s2">Depending to some degree on the situation, but trust is a really crucial one because without that there&#39;s no relationships</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.100" end="01:40:29.859" style="s2">Ok so you&#39;ve got tribe A, and it&#39;s got its tribal gods, and it&#39;s and its traditions and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.080" end="01:40:34.899" style="s2">It&#39;s representation of the being in its images and stories</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.900" end="01:40:39.910" style="s2">And then you&#39;ve got tribe B and you&#39;ve got tried C and you&#39;ve got tribe D and now they&#39;re all coming together</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.730" end="01:40:42.680" style="s2">So what happens?</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.680" end="01:40:44.680" style="s2">Exactly well</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.470" end="01:40:47.470" style="s2">the tribes can go to war</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.690" end="01:40:53.620" style="s2">or they can talk and we&#39;re we&#39;re thinking about a communication that might be extending across a</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.930" end="01:40:56.049" style="s2">Thousand years you have your beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.050" end="01:41:00.880" style="s2">I have my beliefs I can overwhelm you I can subsume you but even then</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.190" end="01:41:03.879" style="s2">I&#39;m likely just to get indigestion from doing it</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.880" end="01:41:09.759" style="s2">it&#39;s very very difficult to wipe out a set of beliefs without wiping out all of the people and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.220" end="01:41:12.639" style="s2">Nullifies the utility of unification the</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.220" end="01:41:17.559" style="s2">More there are of you the better you can defend yourself against other</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.040" end="01:41:21.069" style="s2">organizations that are trying to be larger</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.070" end="01:41:25.239" style="s2">so there&#39;s a powerful self preservation impetus to</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.580" end="01:41:26.390" style="s2">Cooperation and</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.390" end="01:41:31.839" style="s2">So one of the things you see happening in the development of the stories in the old testament for example we know this about</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.940" end="01:41:33.940" style="s2">genesis in particular that there were at least</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.760" end="01:41:37.660" style="s2">this is this is relatively recently so say for</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.210" end="01:41:39.590" style="s2">3,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.590" end="01:41:47.500" style="s2">Not 50,000 years ago there were two different stories. There&#39;s two different stories in the genesis account told by two different</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.560" end="01:41:55.419" style="s2">Storytellers and people who are very good at textual analysis of being able to separate them and they were put together...</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.120" end="01:41:58.749" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember when. Again it&#39;s probably about</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.450" end="01:42:01.899" style="s2">Something between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.900" end="01:42:07.299" style="s2">they were put together by what appeared to be a single editor and so he took these disparate accounts and</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.840" end="01:42:14.710" style="s2">Try to organize them into something that looked like a logical narrative, and that was part of the process by which different tribal</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.040" end="01:42:21.849" style="s2">Representations of the world were brought into something under which the tribes as you as a unit could</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.640" end="01:42:26.890" style="s2">Simultaneously exist so you can think about it as a competition between imagistic</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.350" end="01:42:32.200" style="s2">representations across time and then the emergence of some unifying narratives that that</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.600" end="01:42:37.570" style="s2">Captures the key elements of all of them well enough to bring them into some sort of union</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.570" end="01:42:40.270" style="s2">And it has to be a story with motivational power</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.760" end="01:42:45.070" style="s2">Because otherwise no one will caught on to it and it has to be a story that keeps</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.410" end="01:42:50.230" style="s2">Uncertainty at Bay because otherwise it doesn&#39;t have any utility it has to be a functional story</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.360" end="01:42:55.330" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to tell you a story like that in the story of Marduk, and it&#39;s the mesopotamian story and</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.000" end="01:42:58.000" style="s2">Mesopotamia is one of the earliest</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.340" end="01:43:03.250" style="s2">Civilizations, and it emerged as a consequence of the amalgam of of Middle Eastern tribes</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.470" end="01:43:05.740" style="s2">so that over a very long period of time</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.020" end="01:43:10.810" style="s2">You could think that the gods of all of these tribes were warring in an abstract</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.940" end="01:43:18.099" style="s2">space in a conceptual space and that would be the space of argumentation and conflict and out of that a meta story emerged and</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.320" end="01:43:19.750" style="s2">This is the Meta story</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.750" end="01:43:25.989" style="s2">And it&#39;s one of a host of similar meta stories that came out of the Middle East one of which is the account in Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.120" end="01:43:28.120" style="s2">Okay, so here&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.880" end="01:43:31.869" style="s2">So there are two primary</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.630" end="01:43:34.989" style="s2">deities to begin with Apsu and</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.750" end="01:43:42.819" style="s2">Tiamat now in order to understand that well here&#39;s how the mesopotamians conceptualized the world</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.410" end="01:43:47.860" style="s2">there was a let&#39;s call it a disc that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.070" end="01:43:50.630" style="s2">saltwater</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.630" end="01:43:51.800" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.800" end="01:43:56.529" style="s2">Well what happens when you go to the end of the continent and saw water everywhere, right?</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.530" end="01:44:01.780" style="s2">So wherever you go you run into saltwater, so that&#39;s the disc that surrounds everything now</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.780" end="01:44:05.949" style="s2">Why is it a disc the world is a dome on a disc. Why?</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.890" end="01:44:10.630" style="s2">Well say you&#39;re standing in the middle of the field what does the world look like?</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.050" end="01:44:14.050" style="s2">dome</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.180" end="01:44:17.260" style="s2">On a disc so it&#39;s a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.900" end="01:44:23.409" style="s2">Representation so the bottom of the dome is the ground which you stand what happens if you dig</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.290" end="01:44:26.619" style="s2">You hit water fresh water</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.440" end="01:44:31.480" style="s2">So the dome of the land is on a disk of fresh water</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.180" end="01:44:35.110" style="s2">What happens if you go to the edge of the land you run into salt water?</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.240" end="01:44:39.250" style="s2">The dome of the land is on a disk of fresh water on a disk of salt water</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.100" end="01:44:42.940" style="s2">Okay, those are the two gods Tiamat is</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.940" end="01:44:46.029" style="s2">God of salt water and Apsu fresh water</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.030" end="01:44:53.619" style="s2">And it&#39;s it&#39;s happenstance in some sense because that&#39;s the masculine and the feminine and they could be attributed all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.260" end="01:44:56.559" style="s2">geographical areas so for example</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.020" end="01:45:02.020" style="s2">see if I can think of a good example</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.200" end="01:45:08.200" style="s2">Doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll just leave that for now</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.250" end="01:45:18.099" style="s2">Okay, so the two primary gods are Apsu and Tiamat. Tiamat is female and Apsu is male and they&#39;re locked</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.100" end="01:45:20.100" style="s2">Together in an</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.270" end="01:45:21.740" style="s2">inseparable embrace</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.740" end="01:45:24.790" style="s2">Okay, so how do you understand that? Easy. Yin and Yang?</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.400" end="01:45:31.989" style="s2">It&#39;s the same idea here&#39;s here&#39;s another representation. This is a cool one. I&#39;ve got a couple of them here. That are really cool</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.780" end="01:45:34.780" style="s2">this is from China, so</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.260" end="01:45:37.790" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.790" end="01:45:39.879" style="s2">so this is fuxi and</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.610" end="01:45:44.230" style="s2">You I think I&#39;ve got that right, but I just love that reference.</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.230" end="01:45:49.899" style="s2">It&#39;s so insanely cool this representation, so you see the sort of the primary</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.870" end="01:45:54.340" style="s2">mother and father of humanity emerging from this underlying Snake-like</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.580" end="01:45:58.000" style="s2">entity with its tails tangled together.</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.670" end="01:46:04.929" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a rep.. I really do believe this although. It&#39;s very complicated to explain why I really believe that&#39;s a representation of DNA</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.200" end="01:46:09.700" style="s2">So and that that representation that entwined</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.280" end="01:46:13.179" style="s2">Double helix that is everywhere you can see it in</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.760" end="01:46:20.739" style="s2">Australian Aboriginal art and I&#39;m using the Australians as an example because they were isolated in Australia for like 50,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.740" end="01:46:26.710" style="s2">There&#39;s the most archaic people that were ever discovered and they have clear representations of these double helix structures in their art</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.710" end="01:46:31.659" style="s2">So and those are the two giant serpents out of which the world is made roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.880" end="01:46:34.179" style="s2">It&#39;s the same thing you see that in the Staff of Asclepius</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.340" end="01:46:41.170" style="s2">Which is the healing symbol that the physicians use although usually that&#39;s only one snake but sometimes it&#39;s two so so</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.810" end="01:46:46.989" style="s2">So that&#39;s a that&#39;s a Chinese representation, and then there&#39;s a there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.170" end="01:46:50.170" style="s2">That&#39;s the Egyptian representation</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.170" end="01:46:55.719" style="s2">We talked about the Egyptian story the other day right we talked about Isis and Osiris</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.740" end="01:47:03.580" style="s2">So there they are cobras their tails are twined together see they emerge out of that. That&#39;s the dragon of Chaos</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.820" end="01:47:08.679" style="s2">That manifests itself as culture in nature. That&#39;s the representation</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.260" end="01:47:11.260" style="s2">That&#39;s unbelievably cool</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.270" end="01:47:12.560" style="s2">So okay</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.560" end="01:47:14.889" style="s2">so anyways back to back to</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.560" end="01:47:17.919" style="s2">to the mesopotamian story, so</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.590" end="01:47:25.569" style="s2">Apsu and Tiamat are their primordial deities nature and culture. They&#39;re entwined together and they give rise to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.150" end="01:47:27.740" style="s2">to their first</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.740" end="01:47:32.170" style="s2">Category of children and those are the I think you could think about them as the elder gods</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.840" end="01:47:34.160" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.160" end="01:47:35.270" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.270" end="01:47:39.459" style="s2">What do they represent well the question is what did the gods represent and they represent?</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.650" end="01:47:43.719" style="s2">They represent sort of like primary modes of being it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.780" end="01:47:50.679" style="s2">So think about Ares or Mars the god of war well, that&#39;s that&#39;s a representation of single-Minded aggression</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.710" end="01:47:54.399" style="s2">And then you can think about Eros or Venus which is a primary</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.920" end="01:47:58.239" style="s2">Representation of sexuality and you might say well, why are those deities?</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.790" end="01:48:01.749" style="s2">Well that&#39;s simple. They live forever and</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.390" end="01:48:08.620" style="s2">They control you and their personalities, so that&#39;s that for that. It&#39;s like yes, obviously</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.140" end="01:48:14.050" style="s2">you know and you know that you&#39;re under the sway of anger you&#39;re not in control of yourself if you&#39;re under the sway of</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.870" end="01:48:19.839" style="s2">Erotic possession you make a fool out of yourself. You&#39;re a tool of the power that drives the</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.570" end="01:48:25.029" style="s2">Continuation of the species forward. Hunger is the same thing. Any primordial</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.120" end="01:48:30.219" style="s2">motivational drive. We&#39;ve conceptualized in this class as a personality.</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.220" end="01:48:34.300" style="s2">But those are transcendent personalities and their eternal their forever</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.300" end="01:48:39.070" style="s2">And so that&#39;s why the Greeks for example thought that human beings were just the playthings of the gods</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.350" end="01:48:46.029" style="s2">this idea is echoed in the mesopotamian story, so then you can think about it, sort of neural developmentally as well is that out of</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.550" end="01:48:48.550" style="s2">out of nothing</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.730" end="01:48:50.300" style="s2">of culture nature</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.300" end="01:48:58.270" style="s2">emerges say the two-year-old the two-year-old is a battleground of primary motivational forces and something like that is being hinted at in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.550" end="01:48:59.720" style="s2">mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.720" end="01:49:01.720" style="s2">creation story the first</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.450" end="01:49:03.860" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.860" end="01:49:10.360" style="s2">Progeny of the fundamental union of chaos and order Apsu and Tiamat is the proliferation of these</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.150" end="01:49:15.310" style="s2">primary motivational forces, they&#39;re sort of like the Titans or the or the</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.550" end="01:49:19.060" style="s2">what it wasn&#39;t the Greek gods kept in the</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.180" end="01:49:22.180" style="s2">Underneath the Mountain that&#39;s Zeus</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.760" end="01:49:24.710" style="s2">What&#39;s the name of that?</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.710" end="01:49:29.859" style="s2">They&#39;re like prime.. they&#39;re earthquakes and fires and that sort of thing. They&#39;re primordial forces.</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.860" end="01:49:34.239" style="s2">Okay anyways, so these children are produced and what happens.?</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.910" end="01:49:39.069" style="s2">They&#39;re very noisy. They run around doing all sorts of things you can think about them as grown-up</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.200" end="01:49:43.450" style="s2">two-year-olds causing all sorts of trouble the first thing they do is kill Apsu and</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.420" end="01:49:48.250" style="s2">And make their homeowners corpse that&#39;s brilliant now</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.250" end="01:49:53.529" style="s2">the Story doesn&#39;t say much about Apsu other than that the the culture deity the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.710" end="01:49:58.450" style="s2">Primary Culture deity is not elaborated up that much in the mesopotamian story</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.450" end="01:50:06.009" style="s2">And I think that&#39;s probably because at the time of the mesopotamian civilization was new enough so that we really hadn&#39;t mapped</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.160" end="01:50:11.919" style="s2">The mythology of culture the Egyptians did that much more and I know I told you that story first.</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.920" end="01:50:19.359" style="s2">But that&#39;s just how it goes. So the the elder gods make their their home on the corpse of Apsu.</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.360" end="01:50:26.140" style="s2">Well, what does that mean? Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of how it is. You inhabit the corpse of culture, right?</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.140" end="01:50:28.140" style="s2">it&#39;s the dead past and</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.580" end="01:50:29.690" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.690" end="01:50:34.239" style="s2">But it&#39;s not just the dead past one of the things that&#39;s very cool about the mesopotamian story</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.239" end="01:50:39.729" style="s2">Is that the elder gods are foolish enough to kill it. It&#39;s the death of God by the way.</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.730" end="01:50:47.259" style="s2">It&#39;s no different from what Nietzsche pronounced. This has been going on for a very very long time. This collapse of belief systems</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.440" end="01:50:50.330" style="s2">They kill it carelessly.</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.330" end="01:50:53.019" style="s2">Because they don&#39;t understand what it is that they need to survive.</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.020" end="01:50:56.560" style="s2">They kill it careless carelessly, and then they try to live on the corpse.</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.550" end="01:51:00.550" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what the postmodernists is do by the way.</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.360" end="01:51:07.739" style="s2">Because they assume we have this tremendous system of value that&#39;s being built up across time and it</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.380" end="01:51:10.380" style="s2">sustains us and</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.540" end="01:51:15.119" style="s2">Everyone is criticizing it and criticizing it and trying to destroy it. Well</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.369" end="01:51:21.479" style="s2">we live in its corpse and that will nourish us forever it has to be replenished.</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.480" end="01:51:26.279" style="s2">And there&#39;s nothing in the postmodernist philosophy that can act to replenish. Anyways</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.420" end="01:51:31.830" style="s2">They kill Apsu. What happens when you kill order?</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.340" end="01:51:37.259" style="s2">Chaos comes back. Tiamat. Now this Tiamat.</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.389" end="01:51:41.889" style="s2">Here.</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.889" end="01:51:45.509" style="s2">Feminine, but also the dragon, so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.330" end="01:51:49.350" style="s2">You think out of this fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.230" end="01:51:52.230" style="s2">reptilian treasure bearer</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.330" end="01:51:56.909" style="s2">Culture and Nature emerge and they can pull back into that very rapidly. So here&#39;s an example,</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.010" end="01:52:02.850" style="s2">You&#39;ve all seen Sleeping Beauty. I presumed. How many of you have seen Sleeping Beauty? The Disney film. How many of you haven&#39;t?</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.460" end="01:52:11.279" style="s2">Okay, so there&#39;s a couple that haven&#39;t. There&#39;s a scene in Sleeping Beauty where the evil queen has has imprisoned the prince who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.280" end="01:52:12.630" style="s2">going to wake sleeping beauty up</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.630" end="01:52:18.630" style="s2">So he&#39;s the logos or he&#39;s that he&#39;s the heroic individual or he&#39;s that element of her consciousness that wakes her up. You can</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.630" end="01:52:20.170" style="s2">read it either way.</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.170" end="01:52:22.170" style="s2">She&#39;s got him trapped in a dungeon</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.199" end="01:52:23.770" style="s2">So she&#39;s the kind of ultable</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.770" end="01:52:29.369" style="s2">ultimate Oedipal mother you know. She&#39;s the mother that has her 40 year-old son in the basement who is like</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.560" end="01:52:35.669" style="s2">Overweight and unhealthy and watched and watching video games and being covered with cheeto dust and she always like feeds him sandwiches so he won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.670" end="01:52:38.369" style="s2">leave you know. And she says oh, it&#39;s good thing</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.369" end="01:52:42.179" style="s2">You didn&#39;t go out the world make some poor woman miserable. So anyway</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.179" end="01:52:48.569" style="s2">So that&#39;s the evil queen he&#39;s got the hero trapped in the dungeon. So he goes out he escapes and then</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.239" end="01:52:52.468" style="s2">She goes after him to try to bring him back and turns into the dragon</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.469" end="01:52:59.039" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens in Sleeping Beauty, so that&#39;s that reversion of the of the archetype into it&#39;s even more primordial force. So</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.619" end="01:53:06.269" style="s2">anyway, so Tiamat kind of an amalgam of feminine, nature, and also this more underlying primordial symbol. So anyway</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.270" end="01:53:07.480" style="s2">She is not happy</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.480" end="01:53:14.489" style="s2">She is not happy that these her children killed her husband and so she thinks oh well enough of these creatures we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.790" end="01:53:21.030" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do them in. It&#39;s the flood myth. The same idea. So what happens in the story of Noah this happens worldwide</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.030" end="01:53:21.460" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.460" end="01:53:27.060" style="s2">Human beings get all corrupt and make a lot of racket and break all sorts of rules and God thinks oh, well, you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.580" end="01:53:32.910" style="s2">Enough of you, we&#39;ll just bring in a flood and wipe y&#39;all out. That&#39;s chaos returning you destabilize</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.460" end="01:53:34.990" style="s2">order too badly.</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.990" end="01:53:37.379" style="s2">There&#39;s a flood and that brings with it</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.380" end="01:53:42.750" style="s2">all Sorts of new things because it&#39;s water, but it just drowns you it drowns you. Now Noah is a good man</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.750" end="01:53:44.130" style="s2">so he can ride out the flood.</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.130" end="01:53:50.940" style="s2">He&#39;s the hero that can go down into the Chaos and then back up because he hasn&#39;t let go of his</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.370" end="01:53:54.359" style="s2">Morality despite the fact that the entire society has disintegrated.</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.910" end="01:54:02.309" style="s2">So he saves everything so it&#39;s it&#39;s like Moses crossing the Red Sea and then coming out the other side same same sort of idea.</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.130" end="01:54:09.330" style="s2">Anyways, so Tiamat she&#39;s uh she&#39;s not happy and these gods are careless too and impulsive.</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.330" end="01:54:15.689" style="s2">They&#39;re making a lot of noise and their activity disturbs her. You know and you can see echoes of that fear</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.140" end="01:54:21.869" style="s2">that mythological fear in modern consciousness because we tell ourselves the same story.</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.570" end="01:54:26.610" style="s2">Right? The story is if we keep running around making enough</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.740" end="01:54:31.439" style="s2">racket mother Nature is going to take offense and wipe us out, and that&#39;s the story that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.440" end="01:54:35.100" style="s2">the bottom of the Sort of Apocalyptic element of the Global warming</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.380" end="01:54:44.490" style="s2">Apocalypse it&#39;s like if we if we mock about badly enough nature will take its revenge, okay fine. It&#39;s true. It&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.560" end="01:54:48.209" style="s2">It&#39;s so it&#39;s a story that&#39;s always been true. So anyways</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.030" end="01:54:50.730" style="s2">The Gods are making a lot of noise</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.730" end="01:54:53.970" style="s2">They&#39;re being impulsive, and then they make the fatal error of killing Apsu</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.970" end="01:54:58.379" style="s2">And that&#39;s a big mistake, and so Tiamat thinks alright enough of this. She wakes up</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.380" end="01:55:03.960" style="s2">and she thinks I&#39;m going to wipe them all out. Now that these gods their gods eh I mean, they&#39;re not trivial</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.170" end="01:55:13.020" style="s2">Characters, but they&#39;re pretty worried because their gods, but Tiamat is their mother she gave birth to them she&#39;s mother nature, and if she&#39;s angry</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.660" end="01:55:16.139" style="s2">About it then the Jig&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.200" end="01:55:20.069" style="s2">so what Timat does is she prepares this army of monsters and</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.290" end="01:55:25.049" style="s2">That they&#39;re described there&#39;s I think 13 different kinds of Monsters, and they&#39;re chimeric</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.600" end="01:55:27.720" style="s2">Images, they&#39;re images of you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.319" end="01:55:35.249" style="s2">They&#39;re like dragons. They&#39;re half snake and half bird and half animal and they&#39;re monstrous images, and they&#39;re sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.729" end="01:55:43.529" style="s2">Mesopotamians attempt to imagisticly represent those things that might come forward as an onslaught and so generates a whole</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.349" end="01:55:46.179" style="s2">13 major</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.179" end="01:55:51.958" style="s2">Monsters and then puts a whole army behind them and she elects one of them Qingu is his name as head</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.419" end="01:55:56.009" style="s2">Monster so he&#39;s for all intents and purposes. He&#39;s an early</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.559" end="01:55:59.248" style="s2">representation of Satan he&#39;s Like King of the bad guys and</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.530" end="01:56:03.449" style="s2">it&#39;s important to know about him because if something happens later in the story, so</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.089" end="01:56:07.919" style="s2">so Tiamat&#39;s preparing her army of monsters to</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.099" end="01:56:11.099" style="s2">chimeras to</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.919" end="01:56:13.449" style="s2">wipe out, the</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.449" end="01:56:16.588" style="s2">Gods, and so they&#39;re like shorting out about this</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.589" end="01:56:21.989" style="s2">but while they&#39;re doing it, they&#39;re still making a lot of racket and living the highlife in Apsu&#39;s corpse and and</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.569" end="01:56:25.619" style="s2">Propagating and while they&#39;re doing that they send out one</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.019" end="01:56:30.929" style="s2">God after another to combat Tiamat and they all come back failed.</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.089" end="01:56:35.339" style="s2">So whatever these elder gods are whatever they represent. They&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.099" end="01:56:41.188" style="s2">Whatever it is that can confront Chaos successfully and prevail their powers</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.189" end="01:56:43.979" style="s2">But they&#39;re not whatever that is that ultimate power</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.979" end="01:56:49.048" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the mesopotamians are trying to figure out who or what is king of the gods and</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.569" end="01:56:52.229" style="s2">king of the gods is the thing that confront Chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.749" end="01:56:54.749" style="s2">regenerate order, so</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.989" end="01:57:00.178" style="s2">So they keep producing new gods and one day they produce Marduk</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.459" end="01:57:01.260" style="s2">He&#39;s born,</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.260" end="01:57:02.349" style="s2">and marduk he he&#39;s a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.349" end="01:57:07.679" style="s2">Category of God and every one of the gods knows it and he&#39;s got some very strange attributes one of them is</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.869" end="01:57:14.279" style="s2">He could speak Magic words and so when Marduk speaks the night sky transforms into the day sky and vice versa.</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.280" end="01:57:19.499" style="s2">So he&#39;s he&#39;s the verbal capacity it&#39;s a massive discovery. It&#39;s a massive discovery by the</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.499" end="01:57:26.429" style="s2">mesopotamians because it&#39;s the first time we know of that the idea that it&#39;s the capacity for communicative speech as the</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.649" end="01:57:30.358" style="s2">Primary deity should be at the top of the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.359" end="01:57:35.639" style="s2">It&#39;s one of the most remarkable discoveries of the ages and he also has eyes all the way around his head</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.249" end="01:57:42.179" style="s2">So Marduk is the thing that can speak and see and it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s so all the gods</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.180" end="01:57:45.809" style="s2">Think wow well this is a whole new thing man. How about you go out and</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.360" end="01:57:52.020" style="s2">combat Tiamat. Well it doesn&#39;t sound like much of a picnic. You know the logical thing for any sensible</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.020" end="01:57:56.759" style="s2">god to say is how about no, but Marduk doesn&#39;t say that he says look. I&#39;ll make you guys a deal</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.910" end="01:58:02.069" style="s2">You get yourself together in a whole you know and you have a vote</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.410" end="01:58:06.239" style="s2">for all intents and purposes and you vote me king of the gods and</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.090" end="01:58:10.080" style="s2">Allow me from here on in to Determine destinies</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.080" end="01:58:15.239" style="s2">That&#39;s exactly what the mesopotamian say he gets the tablet of destiny and he&#39;s now in control of it</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.239" end="01:58:17.759" style="s2">So the mesopotamians are working out this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.760" end="01:58:22.200" style="s2">It&#39;s the thing that can see and that can talk that should be the thing that guides destiny</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.200" end="01:58:27.659" style="s2">especially if destiny involves having to go into combat with Chaos itself and</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.030" end="01:58:31.860" style="s2">Restructure the world and so Marduk says those are the terms.</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.860" end="01:58:37.560" style="s2">I&#39;ll do it but I&#39;m king of the gods, and they all think well at the fools can quote didn&#39;t get killed anyway</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.560" end="01:58:43.319" style="s2">so you know what do we have to lose and so they agreed and so Marduk goes out to combat Tiamat and he takes a</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.320" end="01:58:45.540" style="s2">net and a sword and</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.660" end="01:58:51.450" style="s2">he if I remember correctly he fills her with a wind which is I believe part of the</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.880" end="01:58:59.520" style="s2">Manifestation of this voice this voice idea he fills her with a wind he encapsulate her in a net now think about what that means</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.739" end="01:59:04.889" style="s2">you know psychologists even used this word phrase nomological net and</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.470" end="01:59:07.679" style="s2">a nomological net is this is the</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.350" end="01:59:10.890" style="s2">Network of concepts that you use to encapsulate</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.320" end="01:59:16.380" style="s2">Something new in an ideational structure and so the idea of putting something in a net is to</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.660" end="01:59:21.899" style="s2">Put boundaries around it right and to constrain it and so some of that&#39;s actually well</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.900" end="01:59:27.089" style="s2">You can capture a predator in a net and then cut it up, but there&#39;s no difference between that</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.090" end="01:59:34.110" style="s2">There&#39;s a there&#39;s a tight analogy between that and cat encapsulating something novel in a conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.390" end="01:59:40.529" style="s2">Network which then enables you to cut it up into something useful okay, so that&#39;s what happens Marduk goes out. He</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.170" end="01:59:45.660" style="s2">confronts Tiamat he overcomes the monsters and he kills Qingu and</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.300" end="01:59:53.070" style="s2">So and then he makes he cuts Tiamat into pieces and he makes the world and that&#39;s the world that human beings</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.739" end="01:59:54.989" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.989" end="01:59:57.449" style="s2">On and he makes the human beings to serve the gods</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.180" end="02:00:03.329" style="s2">okay, so that&#39;s the first part of the story now he also kills Qingu and he makes human beings out of the blood of</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.330" end="02:00:04.560" style="s2">Qingu now</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.560" end="02:00:09.719" style="s2">That&#39;s a hell of a story right because Qingu is king of the demons and human beings are the creature</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.880" end="02:00:12.359" style="s2">That&#39;s made out of the blood of the king of the demons</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.640" end="02:00:17.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a very similar idea to the idea the later sort of egyptian and</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.800" end="02:00:24.810" style="s2">Judeo-Christian ideas that there&#39;s a Satanic element to being that&#39;s also characteristic of human beings and part of that is well</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.810" end="02:00:31.229" style="s2">What&#39;s the difference between human beings and every other element of being and the answer that is human beings can deceive you?</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.380" end="02:00:34.650" style="s2">Right, we&#39;re the only creatures that can do that</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.840" end="02:00:39.480" style="s2">We&#39;re capable of deception. Voluntary deception, we&#39;re capable of malevolence.</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.480" end="02:00:45.750" style="s2">And so that&#39;s echoed as well in the story in genesis because when Adam and Eve eat the apple</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.910" end="02:00:51.689" style="s2">They wake up the scales fall from their eyes they recognize that they&#39;re naked and they know the difference between good and evil</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.000" end="02:00:57.899" style="s2">which means they can do evil and it took me a long time to figure that out what that meant so imagine because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.900" end="02:01:04.290" style="s2">Causal sequence eh. The snake offers you something that you ingest it wakes you up the scales fall from your eyes</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.290" end="02:01:10.649" style="s2">So now you can see the first thing you do is you realize that you&#39;re naked what does that mean well human being stand upright?</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.110" end="02:01:15.569" style="s2">The most vulnerable part of us is front and center to be hurt</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.570" end="02:01:21.090" style="s2">But also to be judged right to be naked is to be that&#39;s terrifying you want to not die</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.520" end="02:01:26.969" style="s2">You want to cover yourself up, and so that&#39;s the recognition of nakedness, but then you might say well</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.969" end="02:01:31.379" style="s2">Why does the knowledge of good and evil emerge from that? As soon as you know you&#39;re naked and vulnerable</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.989" end="02:01:33.969" style="s2">you know how to hurt other people.</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.969" end="02:01:39.179" style="s2">You&#39;re not a predator anymore, because they&#39;ll just tear you apart and eat you like they don&#39;t want you to suffer although</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.180" end="02:01:45.059" style="s2">They don&#39;t care they don&#39;t want you to suffer. They just want to eat you but once I know what hurts me.</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.760" end="02:01:52.320" style="s2">I know what hurts you and then I can turn that into an art and people have done that and so that&#39;s that&#39;s why the knowledge</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.320" end="02:01:55.710" style="s2">of evil comes immediately as a consequence of the knowledge of of</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.930" end="02:02:02.430" style="s2">Nakedness, and that&#39;s associated with the same idea that human beings are made out of the blood of Qingu. Nasty stories,</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.430" end="02:02:07.649" style="s2">but very you know they&#39;re messing with the fundamental structure reality they want to get this right.</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.489" end="02:02:15.329" style="s2">Ok so one of the cool things about this story, so okay, so that&#39;s Marduk. Now here&#39;s what&#39;s so interesting about that.</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.330" end="02:02:21.749" style="s2">The mesopotamians they&#39;ve got this story about the deities and how they organize themselves to</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.180" end="02:02:28.499" style="s2">Respond to the emergence of Chaos and how to master it. You you go after it you you declare yourself the thing at the top</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.500" end="02:02:33.270" style="s2">Of the dominance hierarchy, your eyes and speech you, go out there voluntarily, you</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.210" end="02:02:40.980" style="s2">encapsulate the Chaos, you cut it into pieces and you make the world. That makes you top god. Brilliant bloody absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.590" end="02:02:47.730" style="s2">Phenomenally brilliant, so what happens that&#39;s what&#39;s happening in the heavenly domain. Let&#39;s say what happens in the earthly domain</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.280" end="02:02:55.650" style="s2">The emperor of the mesopotamians is Marduk. He&#39;s a manifestation of Marduk on Earth, and he has to be a good Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.650" end="02:02:58.500" style="s2">That&#39;s because you might say well, why should you be king?</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.440" end="02:03:04.469" style="s2">Well the answer to that is while you&#39;re most powerful. No, that&#39;s not going to work some other weasels will take you out</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.140" end="02:03:07.799" style="s2">Why should you be king well because you pay attention?</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.800" end="02:03:12.540" style="s2">And you speak properly and you keep Chaos at bay, and you make ingenious things happen as a consequence</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.850" end="02:03:17.729" style="s2">So that&#39;s what the bloody mesopotamians were trying to work out. What should be sovereign and why.</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.460" end="02:03:21.660" style="s2">Okay, so what did they do in the new year ceremony, so</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.180" end="02:03:29.129" style="s2">Imagine that they&#39;re there. They&#39;re the king is in a walled city, right? So that&#39;s the kings at the top of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.130" end="02:03:34.259" style="s2">He&#39;s the eye at the top of the pyramid in a walled city with Chaos outside. Chaos is outside</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.260" end="02:03:37.440" style="s2">That&#39;s the domain of Tiamat at the New Year ceremony</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.960" end="02:03:40.109" style="s2">The old year we know about that</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.110" end="02:03:42.450" style="s2">We still have this idea the old year is an old man</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.730" end="02:03:47.790" style="s2">The New Year is about to be born there&#39;s an intermediary period of Chaos that&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.790" end="02:03:53.819" style="s2">right that&#39;s the intermediate period of Chaos where all the rules are temporarily suspended which is why you can go out and</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.010" end="02:03:58.110" style="s2">Party like there&#39;s no tomorrow New Year&#39;s Eve and before the New Year is born</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.480" end="02:04:04.169" style="s2">The mesopotamian emperor and all of his retinue and the people go outside the city on New Year&#39;s Eve</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.170" end="02:04:07.680" style="s2">And they take statues that represent the gods and they act out</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.410" end="02:04:10.410" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.170" end="02:04:14.790" style="s2">Story that I just told you with the statues and as part of that</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.790" end="02:04:17.050" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.050" end="02:04:19.050" style="s2">Emperor has to take off all his</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.270" end="02:04:23.189" style="s2">Garb his garments that make him king and me in front of the priest and the priest</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.320" end="02:04:25.860" style="s2">If I remember correctly slaps him with a glove</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.860" end="02:04:27.159" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that and</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.159" end="02:04:31.768" style="s2">Tells him that he has to tell everyone why in the last year he wasn&#39;t a very good Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.769" end="02:04:33.219" style="s2">And how he&#39;s going to do better in the future</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.219" end="02:04:36.538" style="s2">Which is exactly by the way, what do you do when you make your New Year&#39;s?</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.329" end="02:04:39.309" style="s2">What do you call those?</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.309" end="02:04:41.788" style="s2">Yes, the ones you immediately break the next day</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.789" end="02:04:47.909" style="s2">But it&#39;s the same it&#39;s this renewal idea that happens that it happens in the depth of darkness in the middle of the winter before</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.099" end="02:04:51.239" style="s2">the light comes back right that&#39;s why it&#39;s set up that way, so</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.420" end="02:04:55.440" style="s2">so anyways and so that so as long as</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.900" end="02:05:00.210" style="s2">The emperor is a good Marduk then that&#39;s why he gets to be emperor, and if he&#39;s not a good Marduk</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.210" end="02:05:03.989" style="s2">Then well someone else should the emperor so so that&#39;s how that works</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.249" end="02:05:12.749" style="s2">and there&#39;s some representations of it, so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.869" end="02:05:15.400" style="s2">There&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.400" end="02:05:17.400" style="s2">Tiamat there</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.530" end="02:05:24.269" style="s2">Sort of spirit matter combination winged dragon right the thing that we&#39;ve seen so many times and there is Marduk. He&#39;s got angel wings</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.570" end="02:05:31.949" style="s2">Why the wings I don&#39;t know exactly why the wings I mean he&#39;s obviously being assimilated to the idea of a bird</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.949" end="02:05:39.748" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if the idea of the far-seeing capacity of the bird was there for the mesopotamians highly probable</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.210" end="02:05:46.259" style="s2">But also the bird is something that flies up above everything else and that can see for long distances, so it&#39;s an aerial spirit</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.260" end="02:05:47.489" style="s2">It&#39;s close to God and all of that</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.489" end="02:05:54.748" style="s2">So so there&#39;s a very primordial representation of the same thing look how much imagination does it take to see</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.329" end="02:05:58.619" style="s2">That that&#39;s the story of human beings encountering the unknown</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.269" end="02:06:04.379" style="s2">You know when you know the code it just seems self-evident. Yes</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.380" end="02:06:09.749" style="s2">well there is he&#39;s got his bow and arrow you know and he&#39;s out there fighting the monsters of the unknown and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.880" end="02:06:15.299" style="s2">Part that how human beings have survived yeah, yeah, that&#39;s and then here</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.300" end="02:06:20.519" style="s2">He&#39;s riding this great big snake. So that&#39;s another representation of the same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.119" end="02:06:27.449" style="s2">Okay, so let me just think for a minute you&#39;ll figure out what I want to do next if I want to go somewhere next</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.449" end="02:06:30.299" style="s2">I guess what I&#39;ll do right. Now is I&#39;ll just show you some additional pictures</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.820" end="02:06:34.349" style="s2">So we&#39;ve laid out the conceptual world to some degree, right?</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.160" end="02:06:37.650" style="s2">mentioned that you can think about it as the</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.740" end="02:06:43.619" style="s2">Potential itself, that&#39;s the dragon of Chaos and then nature which has a positive and a negative element</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.440" end="02:06:48.300" style="s2">Creation and destruction and culture which has a positive and negative emotion</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.550" end="02:06:55.979" style="s2">element there reverse day because it&#39;s the positive element of culture that protects you against the negative element of nature and the negative element of</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.980" end="02:07:03.780" style="s2">Culture can be destroyed by the new coming in from the from the natural world and then the archetypal individual</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.880" end="02:07:11.729" style="s2">Positive and negative as well. That&#39;s the that&#39;s the entire story roughly speaking, and I showed you its manifestations and figures like this</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.580" end="02:07:14.789" style="s2">So you have this is called the open virgin</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.370" end="02:07:20.249" style="s2">The opening virgin because that those two halves can be closed</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.250" end="02:07:25.560" style="s2">So there&#39;s mother nature roughly speaking or the mother of God depending on how you look at it</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.230" end="02:07:28.230" style="s2">and inside her nature</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.870" end="02:07:33.360" style="s2">Culture the Patriarchy the culture supports the suffering individual who?</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.850" end="02:07:40.439" style="s2">Voluntarily accepts death and mortality as the price to be paid for being that&#39;s what that image represents</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.720" end="02:07:42.670" style="s2">It&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.670" end="02:07:45.750" style="s2">Unbelievable, and then you see all these people that decide here are gazing</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.360" end="02:07:47.550" style="s2">uncontrollably at this image</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.550" end="02:07:52.439" style="s2">which is of course exactly what&#39;s happened over the last two thousand years at least in part of the world because</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.660" end="02:07:54.660" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s a tremendous idea</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.480" end="02:08:00.570" style="s2">encapsulated inside that image and the image the idea is something like the voluntary acceptance of</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.060" end="02:08:05.100" style="s2">Suffering is key to its transcendence, and that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a crucial</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.980" end="02:08:07.870" style="s2">psychotherapeutic truth, right</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.870" end="02:08:13.680" style="s2">Things that bother you need to be confronted voluntarily you have to accept them you have to accept them you think well how far does?</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.680" end="02:08:15.680" style="s2">That go well we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.850" end="02:08:18.150" style="s2">It works in small things it works with phobias</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.150" end="02:08:25.139" style="s2">It works with traumas traumas are usually associated with death or disease or malevolence. So that&#39;s pushing it pretty far</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.300" end="02:08:30.059" style="s2">There doesn&#39;t seem to be a limit to the to the idea that the voluntary</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.550" end="02:08:34.679" style="s2">Confrontation with the things that are terrifying is curative there doesn&#39;t seem to be a limit to that</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.720" end="02:08:39.269" style="s2">There&#39;s an example in the story of Exodus when Moses is leading the Israelites through the desert</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.510" end="02:08:47.519" style="s2">They fragment because while they&#39;re out of tyranny so they don&#39;t know what to do. It&#39;s all chaotic, and you know this Moses character</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.520" end="02:08:49.170" style="s2">Yeah, you got them out of Egypt but now</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.170" end="02:08:49.920" style="s2">They&#39;re in the desert</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.920" end="02:08:56.069" style="s2">And there&#39;s nothing to eat and like why should they listen to him and so they start worshipping all sorts of idols and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.070" end="02:09:02.190" style="s2">Of like the fragmentation of what holds them centrally together and so what does God do he&#39;s not very happy about that</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.860" end="02:09:06.480" style="s2">Whoo so he sends a bunch of poisonous snakes into the desert to bite them all</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.090" end="02:09:12.480" style="s2">He thinks enough of these people. And that&#39;s chaos returning right in the form of these poisonous snakes and so</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.300" end="02:09:18.239" style="s2">The Israelites are kind of sick and tired of being bitten by poisonous snakes so they go back to Moses</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.239" end="02:09:21.509" style="s2">And they say well, you know I know we&#39;ve wandered off the path here</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.510" end="02:09:23.520" style="s2">And we didn&#39;t think you were the greatest guy there for a while</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.520" end="02:09:29.009" style="s2">but you know maybe who could have a little chat with God and see what he could do about these poisonous snakes and so so</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.260" end="02:09:35.250" style="s2">Moses entreats God to do something about the snakes and what God tells people to do the strangest thing he says</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.370" end="02:09:41.159" style="s2">make a snake in the image make a bronze snake and put it on a post and</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.650" end="02:09:46.890" style="s2">Have everyone look at it. And everyone who goes to look at the snake won&#39;t be bitten by the poisonous snakes anymore</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.890" end="02:09:49.289" style="s2">I just saw this it&#39;s it just</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.040" end="02:09:58.109" style="s2">Crazy that idea. It&#39;s crazy so and I&#39;ll tell you something else else. That&#39;s very interesting so in that in the Christian story</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.810" end="02:10:05.100" style="s2">Christ assimilates himself to that snake that was put on the post in the desert says exactly the same thing that</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.440" end="02:10:09.719" style="s2">That that has to be looked at because that&#39;s the pathway to salvation</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.239" end="02:10:14.729" style="s2">Roughly speaking. It&#39;s exactly the same idea. It&#39;s the worst thing that can possibly happen</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.820" end="02:10:20.820" style="s2">So you look upon it and meditate upon it, and that&#39;s the key to transcending it well</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.820" end="02:10:23.130" style="s2">So that&#39;s the idea that&#39;s encapsulated in that image</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.710" end="02:10:29.909" style="s2">So it&#39;s you know. It&#39;s no wonder that these ideas had to be expressed in images because they&#39;re so unbelievably</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.730" end="02:10:32.730" style="s2">Complicated that they&#39;re almost incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.400" end="02:10:38.790" style="s2">So they come out first in the image they come out first in the story because they&#39;re just and plus</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.790" end="02:10:40.239" style="s2">They&#39;re so difficult to believe</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.239" end="02:10:46.739" style="s2">What the last thing you would think if you were being bitten by poisonous snakes was that you should make a bronze image of one</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.739" end="02:10:48.989" style="s2">And put it on a stick so that you could go look at it</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.989" end="02:10:52.439" style="s2">I mean, there&#39;s a magical element to that, but it&#39;s psycho therapeutically</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.679" end="02:10:54.360" style="s2">exactly, right</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.360" end="02:10:56.140" style="s2">so I had this client and</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.140" end="02:11:01.619" style="s2">She had a dream about what what she was she was having a really rough time, and she she was a pretty good dreamer.</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.250" end="02:11:07.020" style="s2">She had this dream that she was walking down a road by there was a ocean on one side</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.020" end="02:11:09.629" style="s2">and there was a sort of sand dunes on the other side and</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.270" end="02:11:13.919" style="s2">She looked up, and there&#39;s this guy with a huge python</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.680" end="02:11:18.089" style="s2">that had that had been out there showing it to everyone and</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.790" end="02:11:24.269" style="s2">she took a look and he invited her to come take a look at the snake, but she refused and walked on and</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.790" end="02:11:29.910" style="s2">So she told me that dream. She was also quite imaginative, so I said look let&#39;s let&#39;s try something</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.960" end="02:11:37.470" style="s2">First of all tell me about the snake handler, and she said well. He&#39;s kind of a Charlatan. He&#39;s a show-off</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.470" end="02:11:42.599" style="s2">he&#39;s a he&#39;s a fake and I&#39;m afraid that if I went up to the crowd and</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.940" end="02:11:46.980" style="s2">Where the snake was that they would force me to touch it and so I thought okay?</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.980" end="02:11:49.859" style="s2">So that&#39;s why you walked by I said okay, so let&#39;s play a game. So you</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.710" end="02:11:54.779" style="s2">Sit there and bring that dream image to mind close your eyes bring the dream image to mind</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.780" end="02:12:00.210" style="s2">But let&#39;s play with a little bit like Jung&#39;s technique of active imagination. Let&#39;s play with it a little bit so go up</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.210" end="02:12:05.069" style="s2">There you know imagine that you go up there, and you kind of have to do this like you&#39;re daydreaming</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.320" end="02:12:09.720" style="s2">You know you can&#39;t force it. You have to play with it like you would when you&#39;re daydreaming</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.760" end="02:12:12.780" style="s2">Which is you&#39;re kind of half doing it voluntarily and it&#39;s half</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.600" end="02:12:19.140" style="s2">Manifesting itself. It&#39;s kind of a gateway between you and the collective unconscious. That&#39;s another way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.080" end="02:12:24.180" style="s2">Anyways, I said okay, so go up there and the first thing we&#39;re going to do is figure out</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.180" end="02:12:28.619" style="s2">What are you going to do if the crowd tells you that you have to touch the snake or get close to it?</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.080" end="02:12:33.059" style="s2">Because she needed a defense because it isn&#39;t up to other people to force her to do that</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.060" end="02:12:37.169" style="s2">So we we practiced what she might say like no, I&#39;m I&#39;m comfortable here</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.170" end="02:12:40.410" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to stand in the background. Just going to look at it and get accustomed to it</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.410" end="02:12:43.619" style="s2">I don&#39;t need you to push me forward so she felt pretty good about that</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.620" end="02:12:45.660" style="s2">So I kind of armed her with a defense</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.660" end="02:12:46.510" style="s2">so then she could</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.510" end="02:12:49.410" style="s2">Pretend to go up and take a look at the snake and I said well the first thing</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.410" end="02:12:55.139" style="s2">You should do is take a look at the snake handler and see if he&#39;s who you think he is and so she did that?</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.140" end="02:12:58.559" style="s2">In her imagination she said no, he doesn&#39;t seem to be the Charlatan at all</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.560" end="02:13:03.629" style="s2">He&#39;s got this snake that is his you know something he takes care of and he just has come out here to show</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.030" end="02:13:08.070" style="s2">The people and let people look at the snake and so she said yes</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.070" end="02:13:15.779" style="s2">I said was he someone that you could trust or someone you shouldn&#39;t trust you have to ask both those questions because otherwise you&#39;re leading</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.100" end="02:13:20.689" style="s2">Witness right you don&#39;t want to tell people what to think you have to let them figure it out for themselves</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.480" end="02:13:25.550" style="s2">So and she said no, I think he&#39;s somebody that should be trusted, and I said, okay well</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.550" end="02:13:26.070" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.070" end="02:13:31.009" style="s2">what do you think that you could go up there and and and you know maybe lay your hands on the snake and touch the</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.010" end="02:13:35.809" style="s2">Snake and she said she wasn&#39;t sure about it, but we went through it and she was able to do it and so</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.420" end="02:13:38.420" style="s2">It&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.640" end="02:13:42.499" style="s2">So she had to she had to make contact she had to voluntarily make</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.630" end="02:13:49.100" style="s2">Contact with with the this terrible snake that&#39;s at the bottom of being that&#39;s at the bottom of the tree of existence</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.560" end="02:13:52.039" style="s2">Right that&#39;s where the snake is it&#39;s wrapped around the tree</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.050" end="02:13:58.879" style="s2">Well, why well partly because we lived in trees, and that&#39;s where the damn snakes were down there on the ground where we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.520" end="02:14:03.200" style="s2">Right and that&#39;s the divine tree of being that and so</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.780" end="02:14:05.929" style="s2">Well you have to get the hell out of the tree and go</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.420" end="02:14:12.740" style="s2">Confront the snakes and then that&#39;s the that&#39;s the way out at least in principle. So that&#39;s kind of what that means</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.380" end="02:14:15.380" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.130" end="02:14:19.790" style="s2">Show you here&#39;s another image of the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.380" end="02:14:26.390" style="s2">what I like about this you see the fact that the</p>
<p begin="02:14:26.970" end="02:14:31.729" style="s2">culture the Patriarchy God the father will say here is holding the</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.340" end="02:14:40.159" style="s2">Suffering individual in his arms, and that&#39;s encapsulated by nature it&#39;s it&#39;s very much like the story in Pinocchio, where Geppetto</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.680" end="02:14:42.680" style="s2">Pinocchio wasn&#39;t able to go down</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.690" end="02:14:49.160" style="s2">Into the depths and confront the terrible monster at the bottom of being without having support from his father even though his father ended up</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.160" end="02:14:53.930" style="s2">Trapped inside the whale if he wouldn&#39;t have been supported to begin with he wouldn&#39;t have been able to do it</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.930" end="02:14:56.930" style="s2">And you know I&#39;ve really seen this and I really seen this in people</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.930" end="02:15:02.149" style="s2">It&#39;s a hell of a thing not to have the confidence of your father. It&#39;s really really hard on people</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.190" end="02:15:07.370" style="s2">You know if your father is someone who says to you you can do it. I really believe that you can do it</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.370" end="02:15:08.600" style="s2">I&#39;ll support you in what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:15:08.600" end="02:15:12.350" style="s2">I think that you can sort it out and then acts towards you in that way</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.350" end="02:15:16.640" style="s2">That&#39;s a gift that really almost no one else can provide you with mothers obviously provide</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.640" end="02:15:22.039" style="s2">I think they provide the same kind of gift but earlier you know because the mother has to take care of the infant when the</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.040" end="02:15:28.249" style="s2">Infant has just completely dependent and so and this is Erickson&#39;s idea too Eric Erickson is the mother is is</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.710" end="02:15:35.629" style="s2">The person establishes the relationship that allows the developing person to manifest trust real trust while you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.790" end="02:15:37.070" style="s2">carried for crying out loud</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.070" end="02:15:40.549" style="s2">You know you can be dropped and the mother is also the source of food</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.590" end="02:15:44.000" style="s2">But the father seems to be something like the and I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.340" end="02:15:48.110" style="s2">I&#39;m obviously parsing these things farther apart than they can be need to be because</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.239" end="02:15:51.799" style="s2">The Father can play a nurturing role and the mother can play an encouraging role</p>
<p begin="02:15:51.800" end="02:15:57.620" style="s2">But we&#39;ll keep it simple for now the father seems to be the thing that supports and encourages it says well</p>
<p begin="02:15:57.620" end="02:15:59.540" style="s2">Yeah, you know your little as small and all of that</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.540" end="02:16:06.350" style="s2">And you&#39;re subject to destruction and and and bullying and social pressure and all that but I know you can do it</p>
<p begin="02:16:06.350" end="02:16:09.169" style="s2">I know you can do it and there&#39;s a force in that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.449" end="02:16:12.529" style="s2">Unbelievable and people who don&#39;t have that have a have a hell of a time</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.690" end="02:16:19.370" style="s2">It&#39;s actually one of the things that&#39;s quite fun about doing psychotherapy because you get people who have damaged father figures</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.370" end="02:16:21.180" style="s2">It&#39;s harder with the damaged mother</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.180" end="02:16:27.139" style="s2">Figure a because it&#39;s so bloody deep you know I had a client who I just I just thought she was a remarkable person</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.449" end="02:16:30.169" style="s2">But her relationship with her mother was really disrupted</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.170" end="02:16:31.830" style="s2">It was really really hard to</p>
<p begin="02:16:31.830" end="02:16:33.389" style="s2">she says she would she</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.389" end="02:16:37.399" style="s2">Told me it was like something had been torn out of her at an early age that couldn&#39;t be replaced</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.400" end="02:16:41.599" style="s2">It&#39;s real because he just can&#39;t be someone&#39;s mother you know it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="02:16:42.030" end="02:16:46.999" style="s2">you&#39;re just not there enough for that, but you can sort of be someone&#39;s surrogate father that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.519" end="02:16:51.859" style="s2">That&#39;s a role. You can play later, and that&#39;s what educators do at least to some degree although now</p>
<p begin="02:16:51.860" end="02:16:54.799" style="s2">They&#39;re trying to be mothers and providing safe spaces and all of that</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.800" end="02:16:56.790" style="s2">Which is not really all that appropriate</p>
<p begin="02:16:56.790" end="02:17:03.679" style="s2">so that so the father is an encouraging figure and allows the individual at least in principle to support the</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.929" end="02:17:05.460" style="s2">Catastrophe of being</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.460" end="02:17:07.460" style="s2">Voluntarily and so</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.160" end="02:17:13.939" style="s2">Anyway, so those you know those images are just be a brilliant beyond belief absolutely brilliant beyond belief</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.059" end="02:17:17.629" style="s2">ok well, that&#39;s probably a good place to stop and</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.210" end="02:17:19.260" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.260" end="02:17:24.920" style="s2">So we&#39;ve got through the the two front these two fundamental stories remember in the Egyptian story</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.320" end="02:17:27.409" style="s2">you have much more development of the figure of</p>
<p begin="02:17:27.840" end="02:17:34.429" style="s2">Osiris whose equivalent to Apsu and the Egyptians sort of walked through how this state becomes corrupt and</p>
<p begin="02:17:34.620" end="02:17:40.400" style="s2">deteriorates and what the individual has to do in relationship to the state as well as in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.889" end="02:17:44.090" style="s2">Chaos itself, so in the mesopotamians story. It&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.000" end="02:17:46.860" style="s2">Apsu&#39;s dead and</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.860" end="02:17:50.810" style="s2">Marduk makes a new society out of the pieces, but it&#39;s pretty damn implicit</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.810" end="02:17:56.329" style="s2">You know it&#39;s not detailed whereas by the time the Egyptians come along they say well. Osiris was great</p>
<p begin="02:17:56.430" end="02:18:01.579" style="s2">He&#39;s corrupted by Seth he has an evil brother. So that&#39;s the tyrannical element of the state</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.591" end="02:18:06.830" style="s2">He&#39;s overcome by the evil brother. Which is the tendency of every bureaucratic system everywhere.</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.500" end="02:18:13.340" style="s2">Things fall apart chaos comes back up the hero is born takes on the corruption of the state and</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.650" end="02:18:19.789" style="s2">Goes into the underworld which is like confronting Tiamat, but there I like to have the stories in parallel because one of it is</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.790" end="02:18:27.140" style="s2">The confrontation with absolute unknown Tiamat and the other is the revivification of the state even though the stories also overlap and so</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.510" end="02:18:29.510" style="s2">in the Egyptian story</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.850" end="02:18:31.850" style="s2">the and so just like Marduk was</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.310" end="02:18:40.100" style="s2">the the model for the Emperor the combination of Osiris and Horus was the model for the pharaoh and then there was an</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.100" end="02:18:47.899" style="s2">Idea that emerged out of Egypt this was called the democratization of Osiris, and it&#39;s I think part of what gave rise to the entire</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.420" end="02:18:51.500" style="s2">Judeo-Christian idea set of ideas because the Jews</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.051" end="02:18:57.320" style="s2">Hypothetically came out of Egypt right so their thinking is very deeply influenced by Egyptian ideas</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.410" end="02:18:59.850" style="s2">the Pharaoh</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.850" end="02:19:05.419" style="s2">Was the amalgam of Osiris and Horus and the amalgam of Osiris and Horus was his</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.670" end="02:19:11.720" style="s2">Immortal soul the pharaohs immortal soul and the Pharaoh was allowed to use the symbolism of the conjunction of Osiris and Horus</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.970" end="02:19:17.149" style="s2">But as the Egyptian societies developed the aristocracy started to get to use that symbol</p>
<p begin="02:19:17.700" end="02:19:24.289" style="s2">So it started moving down the hierarchy the idea that it wasn&#39;t only that the pharaoh was Osiris and Horus</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.690" end="02:19:29.690" style="s2">It was been it with the aristocracy and then by the time the Greeks came along it was all</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.820" end="02:19:32.390" style="s2">Men who were part of the political structure and</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.610" end="02:19:39.739" style="s2">Then by the time the Christians came along it was no no wait a minute this applies to everyone men women and not only</p>
<p begin="02:19:40.230" end="02:19:43.489" style="s2">male and female alike, but also not just</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.490" end="02:19:49.760" style="s2">stalwart upholders of the State but criminals, tax collectors, prostitutes,</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.521" end="02:19:52.521" style="s2">outcasts, everyone had this</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.011" end="02:19:59.150" style="s2">Osiris/Horus soul inside of them and were entitled to be treated as</p>
<p begin="02:20:00.240" end="02:20:06.469" style="s2">If they were intrinsically valuable as a consequence of that, and that&#39;s the bedrock as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.470" end="02:20:09.740" style="s2">That&#39;s the bedrock idea upon which western civilization is predicated</p>
<p begin="02:20:09.870" end="02:20:15.620" style="s2">It&#39;s the sovereignty of the individual and the individual sovereign. Why?</p>
<p begin="02:20:15.990" end="02:20:18.589" style="s2">The individual is the eye that&#39;s up above the pyramid.</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.870" end="02:20:25.429" style="s2">The individual is the thing that can dominate sets of dominance hierarchies. The individual is the thing that play is not the game</p>
<p begin="02:20:25.430" end="02:20:26.850" style="s2">but the metagame.</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.850" end="02:20:33.110" style="s2">The individual is the thing that revivify the dead culture. The individuals the thing that that goes out to</p>
<p begin="02:20:33.630" end="02:20:40.219" style="s2">combat chaos and generate something valuable as a consequence, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s sovereign and valuable. That&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.860" end="02:20:44.209" style="s2">foundation of our legal system and our culture, so</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.030" end="02:20:47.030" style="s2">so think about it as the</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.430" end="02:20:53.510" style="s2">Emergence as an emergent property of enlightenment ideals is dangerous because that&#39;s four hundred years</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.030" end="02:20:56.030" style="s2">Who cares about four hundred years?</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.130" end="02:21:03.229" style="s2">This is forever and forever is a lot more firm grounding than four hundred years. It&#39;s not a set of rational ideas</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.270" end="02:21:05.689" style="s2">It&#39;s way way deeper than that</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.540" end="02:21:08.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:21:08.400" end="02:21:10.400" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.950" end="02:21:13.369" style="s2">Good enough. We&#39;ll see you in a week</p>
