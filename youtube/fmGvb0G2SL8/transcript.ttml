<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">fun one wouldn&#39;t it especially as like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">welcome question what&#39;s a lie</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">hold on let&#39;s see um i wonder if i could</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">answer both of those</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">um maybe they&#39;re the same answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">yeah i mean there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s funny there&#39;s a public versus</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">private no i don&#39;t know the okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">do you mean just kind of like it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">that a a nice way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">a poetic way of saying what&#39;s on my mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">pretty much i was just thinking earlier</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">about the public and private balance</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">um i was talking with someone else who</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">also has the same tendency as me which</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">is to feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">the need to dive in a hundred percent to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">one thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">or a hundred percent into another thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">so therefore like a very black and white</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">and she asked me um she said well what</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">having a kid like once you have a kid i</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">mean that kind of means you need to put</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:47.919" style="s2">your whole career on hold</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">and your work life is on hold because</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.919" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">your kid is your top priority now so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">i said no no no no i said yeah my kid is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">my top priority but</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be a balance between</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">public and private like if if i was like</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">private life and i did nothing in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">public that would be really</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">sad to me but on the other hand if i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">public life and had no private life that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">would also be really sad</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">so no um i mean my kid&#39;s only eight</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">years old</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">so i&#39;ve only been doing this for eight</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">years i&#39;m no big expert but um</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">i really like this idea of saying and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">not or to things and not thinking we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">need to pick one</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">or the other um and each of us finding</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">our balance</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">whether you know in my case like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">public private thing it&#39;s finding like</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">i like for about 40 of my life to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">public and 60</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:43.039" style="s2">private or whatever it may be and i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:46.800" style="s2">thinking of the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.039" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">of the country</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.800" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">house and city apartment meaning there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">centuries-long tradition for those</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">that can afford it to have an apartment</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">in the city</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">and a house in the country so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:04.800" style="s2">either or you don&#39;t have to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:07.280" style="s2">do i want to live in the city or</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.800" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">do i want to live in the country for</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.280" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">hundreds of years people have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">doing this thing where they have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">little apartment</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">um in london and a house</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">up in gloucestershire somewhere uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">or it&#39;s the little apartment in vienna</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">in the house out there whatever like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">it&#39;s i&#39;m thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">that that&#39;s the and answer to where to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have to pick one or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">other that you can set up your life in</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">such a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">that you can have your city apartment</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">and your country house and say yes to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">because you don&#39;t need to just you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">need to deny</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">any aspect of your personality or your</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">that you could say yes to them and just</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">find out how to make the balance</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">so yeah there is a uh there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">alive at the edge of my thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">not a lie</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">ever like what came to mind there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">like cities dichotomies that pop up</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">in our mind uh and then this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">like getting into right</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">relationship with them and so like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">private versus public for</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">example um i publicly came out really as</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">a stoic since covet online</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">came online um and i&#39;m finding like just</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">my avatar in the spectacle if you will</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">you know is making me become more stoic</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">and virtuous in my my daily life</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">because people are seeing that like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">should i live up to it so it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">identity piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:29.680" style="s2">um and i feel like the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">relationship with private and public is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.680" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">slowly coming into place right here</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:35.920" style="s2">so do you have any any thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">yeah okay so what you just said like i</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.920" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">came out as a stoic</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s probably some parts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">that disagree or not aligned</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">with stoicism as an ism</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">uh and so the this whole idea of isms</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">this need to subscribe</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">all the way in uh maybe i&#39;ve just kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">of have a bad association with isms but</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">when i think of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">anything that ends with ism it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">this kind of all-in subscription</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:08.560" style="s2">uh to something um which reminds me of</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">people and i think there&#39;s a balance</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.079" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">there of like having an idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">then also listening to actually what</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">people want and what people are telling</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">you to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">and like there&#39;s a balance there too and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">so like maybe i just want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">harking on this like</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:05.759" style="s2">man it&#39;s hard to have one identity when</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">there&#39;s this other whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.759" end="00:16:10.240" style="s2">opposite side and how you do that in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">daily life and really maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">balance without just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">toppling over in this day right well it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">helps to know okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">a music teacher when i was a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">told me something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">that i found interesting he felt it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">crucial he said like this is the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">important thing you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">he said before you go out into the music</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.279" style="s2">business you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">what approach you&#39;re taking are you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.279" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">going to please the industry</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">or are you going to please yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:41.199" style="s2">i said well both</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">and he said no you need to pick you need</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.199" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">to choose</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">like ultimately it&#39;s going to come down</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">to that if</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">you know this or that decision um</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">he said because if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">please the industry you can study</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">the billboard top hits and you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">figure out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">a hit and you can figure out how to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.279" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">rich</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">or you can decide that that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter that much to you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to just make the music</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">you want to make and if it makes some</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">money that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.199" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">if it&#39;s able to support you and pay for</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">your cost of living</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s great and if anything more than</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">that is just dessert</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">so it depends on peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">intentions too like um he may feel like</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">you know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">it may even be that the stoa loses money</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">each month but he says you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">this is worth it to me like some people</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">have a hobby where they spend money on</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">bicycles and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">go on bike trips some people buy ping</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">pong tables i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">spending my time and money on the stowa</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">because i enjoy doing this</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">even if it loses money um so yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">depends</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">with intentions too like there are uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">all of us have things that we do not for</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">the money</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">and we just choose that this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">like doing not every i actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:55.679" style="s2">kind of hate the monetization of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.679" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">i hate that um that every good idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">needs to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">immediately have this like okay how can</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">we monetize this</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">um and i i resist that a lot by keeping</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">super like diy technically like when you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">go to my website</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like s-i-v-e dot rs it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">bare-bones static html</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:17.919" style="s2">because i&#39;m like no i&#39;m not going to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">into that hole of filling it with</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.919" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">javascript and stuff that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:22.559" style="s2">make it expensive to run and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">have employees and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.559" end="00:18:26.840" style="s2">all of that because then i&#39;d have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">the question of how to monetize this</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:30.720" style="s2">um but yeah so maybe i don&#39;t know peter</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">if you&#39;re feeling the same way about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">stoic like you&#39;re just gonna do this no</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">matter what</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">yeah one thing uh i recall reading your</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">book i read it years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:41.440" style="s2">but i got a sense um it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">just doing it for fun number one and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.440" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">anytime something came to you like some</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">[ __ ] hit the fan you use that as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">forcing function to create some policies</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s not like you have this top down</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">thing going on and i also got a sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">you could end at any time and be cool</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">with it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">yeah literally um i did i</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">i had some weird paranoid fear i can</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">tell you guys now the old cd baby logo</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">uh the original cd baby logo i had</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">actually scanned it off of a hallmark</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">card</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">because it was just something i was just</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.720" style="s2">doing in my living room so</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">there was a funny picture of a baby face</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">going like that on a hallmark card so i</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">scanned the hallmark card and i put it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">inside i photoshopped it with layering</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">the whole of my cd and that was the logo</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">so i was always scared that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">hallmark was going to find this out and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">sue my ass to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">and so it kind of felt like at any point</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:34.960" style="s2">this whole thing could shut down and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">had to always be okay with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.960" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">um yeah we all know this does have some</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:41.120" style="s2">comparison there we don&#39;t need to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">that blatantly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.120" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">i was trying to fish for it but</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to be obvious um all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">jess you had some questions</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">i have a bunch of questions but i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">just pick the last one that i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">um which is uh you&#39;ve talked a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.679" end="00:20:01.679" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">um kind of refusing to choose</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.679" end="00:20:08.720" style="s2">philosophy um and that&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">really admire because um like</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.720" end="00:20:11.840" style="s2">uh i&#39;ve been trying to do that in my own</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">life like i</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">um quit a job last year and was trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">been trying to build something new and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s basically been like this refusing</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">to pick</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">any one thing a friend said something i</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">asked her what she was gonna do and she</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">said i&#39;m gonna live well</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">every day for the rest of my life and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">i guess the question is like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:33.919" style="s2">if that&#39;s the way that you live</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">first of all i guess is there a way that</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">spiritual self spiritual practice or</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna answer sideways there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.559" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">interesting quote i heard recently which</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">an open mind like an open mouth</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">needs to eventually close on something</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">and when i heard that i went oh god</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">that&#39;s good because like sometimes i</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:17.360" style="s2">am too open-minded which then made me</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">kind of reflect on what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.360" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">too open-minded it&#39;s like well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.480" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">too open-minded when you never decide</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">on anything when you just are always</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">leaving all options open</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">um you can do that to a fault and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">really like that thing we do in english</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">where you could say like any positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:38.400" style="s2">thing and you can say to a fault</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">somebody can be generous to a fault um</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.400" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">sweet to a fault and open-minded to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">which means always open never deciding</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">um and i heard that the the latin root</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">of the word decide</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">i think the dec in there means cut to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">like to cut off other options</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">we need to decide things so um so i</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">this idea of i&#39;m always just going to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">whatever i want</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">um it could be a rationalization</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">for not deciding something um</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">and i guess you don&#39;t nobody ever needs</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">to decide anything until you find out</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually getting in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">want most so i often think about this</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">dichotomy but like what you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">now versus what you want most like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">i want</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">now is chocolate all the time what i</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">want most is to be healthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">uh so if i only were to observe the now</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">and have chocolate all the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">it would uh it would hurt what i want</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">metaphorical version of that like</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s fun to just do what we want every</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">day but that&#39;s kind of a shallow happy</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">and sometimes the deeper rewards come</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">not following your daily impulses and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">doing what you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">most um that&#39;s how i think of it there</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">are lots of things i do</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">in a day that i don&#39;t really want to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">today but i know that that&#39;s what i want</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">does that make sense or does that help i</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">think i kind of answered that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">yeah i guess um it&#39;s also not so much</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">about like whether or not you follow</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">like any given</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">impulse but also like whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">or how you make sure to include all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">the aspects of yourself in a full life</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">like all of that that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">thing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">i&#39;m referring to like like for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:27.600" style="s2">like right now i don&#39;t have a guitar</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s some part of me that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.600" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">really awake because the guitar is on</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">the wrong side of the country</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">you know or that&#39;s that&#39;s a very literal</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">expression no that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">i got as you can tell i like those</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">little metaphors um</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">uh it&#39;s funny i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">okay you guys are you know i&#39;m not here</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">to promote anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">so please don&#39;t think that i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">this for any self-promotional reason but</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">i&#39;m still writing my next book called</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">how to live</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s totally up your alley you</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">plural everybody with top row because uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the um</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">the whole the idea it&#39;s so much fun</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">sorry if you don&#39;t mind i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">pause</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.080" style="s2">you&#39;ll see it has to come full circle of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">what you&#39;re just saying there&#39;s a book</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.080" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">called sum by david eagleman uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">some spelled s-u-m and it&#39;s probably my</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">single favorite book of all time because</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">i think the format is so brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s 40 little short stories the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">subtitle is uh 40 tales from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">afterlives</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">and every little short story uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">answers the question of what happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">when you die wait cody did you just hold</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">it up</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">just so um</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">every little short story inside every</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">chapter answers what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">but every chapter disagrees with all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">the others</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s like chapter three here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">happens when you die you&#39;re awake and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re surrounded by these little</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">creatures</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">chapter four when you die you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">giant empty</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">mansion and nobody&#39;s there and you walk</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">for days chapters nine</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">when you die uh you&#39;re immediately</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">accosted but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">so i love this format of</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">answering the same question a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">in deliberately conflicting ways and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">read the book twice</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">over two years and then suddenly while</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">driving down the road i went</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">live that&#39;s going to steal his format</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">it every chapter is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">completely convinced</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">that it has</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">the right answer um it&#39;s a blast to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">write</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">somebody&#39;s crazy we say that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">imbalanced or that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">off balance or that they&#39;re um uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">you know all happiness all the good life</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">is a balanced life</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">but so in the concrete how to live</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">this way it was about using the clock</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">as your ally like a hunter uses his</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">hunting dog</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">to let the clock um aid you in your</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">because if we just let our</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">desires run their course then we end up</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">doing too much of what makes us happy</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">um we do not enough of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">we need to do but</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">don&#39;t make us happy in the moment and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">if you acknowledge these different</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">aspects of your personality</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">that need to be balanced your different</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">needs uh public versus private your need</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">everybody has a human need for certainty</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">but we all have a human need for</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:28.000" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">and those are clashing things but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">need to acknowledge both of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">and what most people do is they swing</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">their lives in this pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">where they follow one path for a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">years and they say hey man i&#39;m just i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">quit my job and go completely nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s because they&#39;ve had too much</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">certainty in their life</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">no offense and um so they so they go</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">all the way the other side because they</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">say i&#39;ve been ignoring this aspect of my</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">personality so they go 100</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">to this other one but now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">imbalanced again now there&#39;s like too</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">much uncertainty and after a couple</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">years they go i just need a little more</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">root in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">so instead the balance chapter is uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">saying that you have to use the clock to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">acknowledge um the clock on the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:08.960" style="s2">to schedule your</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">need for uncertainty your needs for</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.960" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">certainty</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">your needs to make music you need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.900" style="s2">learn you need to create and express</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.900" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s how my balance chapter would</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">answer that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">awesome thank you jess</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">the title of this session and so i</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">thought oh just ask the direct and easy</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">question which is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">tell us in what way you see</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">entrepreneurialism as a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">because um that landed really strong</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">and i&#39;m interested to hear your take</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">oh uh let me try to make up a take then</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">um let me think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">do i i don&#39;t know um</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">i never you know i i only recently</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">realized that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">the word spiritual has the word spirit</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">in there which seems to imply that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">some ghosty thing um and so i</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">now i&#39;m suddenly like unsure if i</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">ever knew what that word meant i also</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:53.919" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">yesterday i found out the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">the word pithy i&#39;ve been called pithy</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.559" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">for years and i i with pith i think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">the inside of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:02.240" style="s2">wood and it&#39;s just like this really</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">lightweight thing and so every time</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.240" end="00:30:04.640" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">called me pithy i thought they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.640" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">meant i was an airhead</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">i thought oh okay sure i could summon</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">airhead if everybody says so</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">and then just yesterday i looked it up</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">and it said you know like powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">profound it went</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">oh uh so now i don&#39;t know spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure if i know what that means</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.279" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">entrepreneurism or entrepreneurship and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">spiritualism um</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">yeah sorry i don&#39;t know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a variation on that question if</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">you want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">a slightly different angle that i might</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">say something about if you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">ah now i&#39;m beginning to wonder if like i</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.159" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">made up the title</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">no i think i also saw that just before</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not your fault</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">no okay well then it&#39;s like it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">fault technically</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna i&#39;ll i&#39;ll try out a practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">here which is like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">the collective uh presencing practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">where i sit with something for just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">second get uncomfortable and spit out</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">whatever comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">so what&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">coming into a space that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">unfamiliar with</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:15.640" style="s2">and uncertain about what expectations</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.640" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">pre-exist your arrival ooh</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">it you have to have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">confidence that you can do this um</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">thinking about this with parenting</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">because my kid is eight and how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">instill</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">um thinking of how you can influence</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2">so i i picked a price like i set an</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">amount that would just kind of pay for</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">my time</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.839" style="s2">but i still thought that of this like as</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">my community service</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.839" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">um like the world has been good to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s time i give something back and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.839" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">yeah i was just doing this the way that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:26.079" style="s2">some people would volunteer at a soup</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">kitchen or something</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.079" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">and then it got really popular and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">became a full-time job and i had to hire</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">somebody to help me do it and so on</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">um so the whole time i never thought of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">it as like</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">that narrative that people put around</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">this thing like</p>

<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">lot of [ __ ] for it and</p>

<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">that&#39;s different from what most people</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">um and the about page was actually a bit</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s so liberating for them to read</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">rational thoughts can actually change</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">the irrational emotions underneath them</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:59.280" style="s2">sometimes um yeah</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">and i like</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">unmuted and went public i was telling</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">him that i&#39;m psyched to be here because</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">to get behind it</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">um but okay so the asking help thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">the idea that i said earlier about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">like stoic sage as a service</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">um the idea that any of us could do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">because the most helpful thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">is to get the opinion of somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">in your head because in your head it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">giant tangle of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">billions of little thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">considerations that are going into any</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">given decision you&#39;re trying to make or</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">what should i do it&#39;s like mixed in with</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">a billion things right</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">but then when you first the act of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">having to turn it into a question i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">like making it smaller here</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">that like to turn this jumble of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">into a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">that you ask of somebody else just that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:49.119" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">is huge hugely helpful</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.119" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">um to say like okay if i had to describe</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">this to somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:57.839" style="s2">what&#39;s the actual question so um</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">computer programmers do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.839" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s called rubber ducking</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">if you search the web you could probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">read a description of more thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">it so rubber</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">ducking was called that because um a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">couple</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">famous programmers said that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">actually put a rubber duck</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">on their monitor on their computer</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">monitor so when they get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">they have to explain it to the rubber</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">duck all right ducky</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">get and in just the act of having to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">describe it</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">even to a rubber duck helps but now</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">being on the receiving end of that um</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">it&#39;s always easier to give advice to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">to somebody else than it is to take it</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:40.000" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">right so um</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">if all those things that big jumble of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">things in your head</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">that&#39;s making you feel lost and confused</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">if you were somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">asking yourself that question it would</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">be easy for you to give that person</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">advice you&#39;d say what to do because</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">you&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">that jumble of thoughts it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">what somebody else should be doing um</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">when you&#39;re not in there in the mess of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">tangled thoughts so um</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">yeah i think that asking almost anybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">for help or for feedback especially</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">someone that doesn&#39;t know you well</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what i really like about this</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">idea about the rabbi um</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">even years ago before i&#39;d heard of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">stoicism i always liked that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">because i lived in new york city for</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">years and i you know there were like</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">these like jewish communities</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">i i had a clear picture of the rabbi</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">that i would go to for wisdom um</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">so whenever i get stuck i&#39;d often think</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:38.160" style="s2">like what would the rabbi say</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">and so there&#39;s like this little rabbi in</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">my head that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">basically busy and disinterested and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">just like all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll give you two minutes what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">the problem i might have to like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">tell him my problem in two minutes i</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">don&#39;t have time for the details what</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">what is it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">uh and i have to reduce it down to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">and of course if you reduce the problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">down to two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:46:58.800" style="s2">and you think of like what would the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">rabbi say you know we can even do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">in our heads but</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:04.480" style="s2">having another person do that is great</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">so um when somebody asks my advice on</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.480" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">finding a great mentor or a great life</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">coach</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">i say no you don&#39;t need to find a great</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">one just any of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">any of those people that are out there</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">it kind of blew my mind um for</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">for um for those in the audience derek</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">is narrating this video at a music</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:01.760" style="s2">festival</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">where this low nut is dancing um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.760" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">before you know it by the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">video there&#39;s an enti</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">everybody is dancing with them and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">made a movement um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">derek i&#39;m just curious you had this</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">fantastic takeaway that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.319" style="s2">leadership is over glorified if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">watch the video it was the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.319" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">follower</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">that was the most important to turning</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.280" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">the lone nut into a movement</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:25.280" style="s2">i&#39;m curious how this principle has like</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">been a part of your thinking and played</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">out in your life since you&#39;ve made that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">video</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">and if you change your mind about any</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">aspects of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">i&#39;m so sorry to have a non-answer for</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">fun question especially if it&#39;s the last</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">question but</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">no um i basically have almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">no thoughts on leadership uh it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">it was a youtube video that was bouncing</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">around the web it was like on reddit or</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">something in 2009</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">i watched it and i went huh huh and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">like a little later i was like</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">huh that&#39;s kind of like that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">like a metaphor for leadership wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">i think i had just recently read malcolm</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:03.040" style="s2">gladwell&#39;s tipping point and i had just</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">read seth godin&#39;s book called tribes</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.040" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">and um i have no thoughts on leadership</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:08.880" style="s2">of my own</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">i was only channeling what i had read in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.880" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">the tipping point in tribes and i went</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">huh i get what&#39;s happening here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">like because one guy did it but like</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:17.599" style="s2">really he was just on his own but once</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">somebody started following him</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.599" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what made other people get up and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">following but now look people came in</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">slowly and once there were like three or</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">four people</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">now the people that were standing on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:29.359" style="s2">fence feel okay about getting in</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">so i only had basically three minutes of</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.359" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">stuff to say about that and i wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">little tiny blog post</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">and then the ted conference put out a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">call for speakers and i tossed my hat in</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">the ring and they chose that</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">and um i did it on stage at ted</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:46.559" style="s2">and i was nervous as hell and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">after i did that talk um which sorry</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.559" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">this sounds like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">um bragging but uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">it got a standing ovation at ted which</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">is weird that only happens about like</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">once a day at ted that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">everybody stands up for a speaker so i</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">was the guy that day and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">flattering</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">so after i gave the talk for the next</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">three days all of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">like literary agents came up to me going</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.880" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">oh my god you need to turn this into a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">book and you know i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">you know we&#39;re gonna i can get you onto</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">the speaking circuit to talk about your</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">leadership lessons we need to make a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">book out of this and i just kind of said</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:16.640" style="s2">no to all of them i said</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">i have nothing more to say that was it i</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.640" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">had a three minutes worth of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">a metaphor to make and that&#39;s all i have</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">to say about that so i said no to all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">so sorry um i don&#39;t actually think about</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re an entrepreneur and like</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:09.440" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing now</p>

<p begin="00:53:17.839" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">figure out why</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">you are the way you are but um i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just because</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">um when i was a little kid we moved</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">around a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">so um when i was five years old we moved</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">i was</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:32.960" style="s2">like went to a hippie school in</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">california when i was five we moved to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">england</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">for a year and everybody called me the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">american kid and i just felt like</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">oh you hate you english people i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">like the way you do things</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">your rules don&#39;t apply to me but then i</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">moved back to america</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">and everybody called me the english kid</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">because i&#39;d picked up the accent</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">and so now i didn&#39;t feel a part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">america i didn&#39;t feel part of england</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">and then i went to like a uh kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">posh high school but i just wanted to be</p>
