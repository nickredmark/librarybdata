<p begin="00:00:03.659" end="00:00:09.719" style="s2">specifically to Chris for from special</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.319" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">books for special kids I&#39;m so sorry your</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.719" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">comment section got to leave it off with</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:16.379" style="s2">YouTube I think that is horrible and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:18.359" style="s2">only came across your channel like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.379" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">month ago and I&#39;m so excited I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.359" end="00:00:22.590" style="s2">telling people about it it is amazing I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">love falling in love with the kids and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.590" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">adults that you interview please keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">doing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:31.579" style="s2">but when listened to you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with YouTube I had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.579" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">somewhat of a solution come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">which is in no way helping with youtube</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">because their corporation and they seem</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">to have policies that are broken and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to fix that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">my solution what I&#39;m here on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">to do with my health challenges is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">create the democratic transparent</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:53.340" style="s2">technologic company that we all own</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.809" end="00:00:55.050" style="s2">together we can create things like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">YouTube that we own that we can decide</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.050" end="00:00:58.710" style="s2">how it&#39;s monetized and we can make</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">logical conclusions of like here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.710" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">blanket rule but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">saying is their solution that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">take a longer time I&#39;m often very</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">saddened by the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">people on this planet who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">friends and don&#39;t have connection</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">whether that&#39;s because they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">can&#39;t find the people they connect with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">or because they have have health</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:23.810" style="s2">challenges that they look different</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:26.630" style="s2">whatever the reason is I think that a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.810" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">friendship like a site designed</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.630" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">specifically for that purpose a site</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">that isn&#39;t YouTube that is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">so that the little girl you interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">that is nine and going through cancer</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">and can&#39;t find friends at her school can</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:43.049" style="s2">have a like dating site to find actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">friends where people can can support</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.049" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">each other a whole entire site is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">created so that that&#39;s the case because</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">neurotypical kids right all kids need</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">help finding friends and so to be able</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">to facilitate that so that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">find a place and everyone can have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">friends and everyone can have community</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">I have ideas on how to create that but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">don&#39;t have the means right now to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">physically do it I&#39;m in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">creating community to be able to do the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:14.120" style="s2">big the big thing the big net Netflix of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">apps that we collectively owned</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.120" end="00:02:20.150" style="s2">but I would be willing to work on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:21.530" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s not I don&#39;t know what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.150" end="00:02:25.549" style="s2">would have to offer besides the exact</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.530" end="00:02:28.700" style="s2">idea which is a dating site for kids to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.549" end="00:02:31.489" style="s2">find their to find friends and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.700" end="00:02:33.019" style="s2">even a fan base site for like your the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.489" end="00:02:35.090" style="s2">people you interview and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.019" end="00:02:36.830" style="s2">because what I do see when I see people</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.090" end="00:02:39.950" style="s2">on your site is like oh I love Ruby and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.830" end="00:02:41.750" style="s2">I love but there&#39;s like millions of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.950" end="00:02:44.930" style="s2">other ones out there who will never be</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.750" end="00:02:46.519" style="s2">on your channel anyway and as I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.930" end="00:02:49.400" style="s2">you would agree they&#39;re equally</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.519" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">deserving of connection enough having</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.400" end="00:02:55.849" style="s2">the world see them and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:58.970" style="s2">everyone is is worthy of that and if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.849" end="00:03:01.250" style="s2">can create anyone can create a site that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.970" end="00:03:03.500" style="s2">is designed so that we can facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.250" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">that process in a safe and caring way</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.500" end="00:03:07.849" style="s2">what my view is always bringing those</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:09.590" style="s2">people together to create that instead</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.849" end="00:03:10.910" style="s2">of doing it behind closed doors but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.590" end="00:03:14.090" style="s2">would love to chat with you and offer</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.910" end="00:03:18.019" style="s2">anything that I that I could offer in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.090" end="00:03:20.120" style="s2">that regard and potentially work through</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.019" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">a process of that being our first</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.120" end="00:03:23.150" style="s2">project that we&#39;ll own collectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:24.739" style="s2">together if that interests you were</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.150" end="00:03:26.900" style="s2">doing it all on your own in a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.739" end="00:03:28.069" style="s2">or not-for-profit I just want it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.900" end="00:03:30.530" style="s2">exist in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.069" end="00:03:34.430" style="s2">I just want children to be able to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.530" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">community and I want your work to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:40.870" style="s2">what it is which is powerful and amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:40.870" style="s2">and I will end this year thanks</p>
