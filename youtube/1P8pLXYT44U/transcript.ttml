<p begin="00:00:15.030" end="00:00:18.630" style="s2">that word I know that some people react</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:20.960" style="s2">to it because they&#39;re say that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.630" end="00:00:23.189" style="s2">way of dismissing alternative narratives</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.960" end="00:00:27.000" style="s2">so we&#39;re not going to do that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.189" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">going to really talk about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.000" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">context of the crisis that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">through right now the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">really interested in is why the levels</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">of certainty on all sides it was really</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">interesting we put out a film yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">or a couple of days ago Daniel SHM Acton</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">Berger about conspiracies and I saw one</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:46.710" style="s2">of the first comments was which side is</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">Daniel on and then five minutes later oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.710" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">I&#39;ll keep watching he&#39;s on it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">this is really interesting but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">make sense of things if we&#39;ve got kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">of an attachment to one side or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:00:59.940" style="s2">other so what we&#39;re going to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">film is talk to some of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:05.060" style="s2">we&#39;ve had on the channel before and some</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">new people so john vivace who&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">psychology at toronto who looks at like</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">how the brain works why we fixate on</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:17.430" style="s2">certain things and ignore other things</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">like how our pattern recognition works</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.430" end="00:01:21.420" style="s2">we&#39;re losing a lot of our connections</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">we&#39;re losing a lot of our identity</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.420" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">around work or our home what we consider</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">our home and where we&#39;re safe is</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:31.430" style="s2">shrinking and then at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:33.770" style="s2">we&#39;re beginning when it from our are</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.430" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">like even our scientific and political</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.770" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">authorities we&#39;re being told about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">thing which is like an Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">deity it&#39;s ubiquitous it&#39;s invisible</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">and look what it&#39;s demanding from us</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:52.680" style="s2">it&#39;s demanding very strict strict purity</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">codes it&#39;s like we&#39;re suddenly back in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.680" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">you know the early Iron Age and that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">that you know and and this is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">baked into us this way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">purity codes and demonic forces and also</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">demos in the UK has been looking at</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:18.270" style="s2">spirity theory since about 2010 so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.140" end="00:02:19.710" style="s2">tweeted out something like hey my friend</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.270" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">is basically a sane individual never</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.710" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">been into conspiracy theories before but</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:27.810" style="s2">now won&#39;t shut up about you name it 5g</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.810" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">the your sense that this this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">growing right now yeah I mean as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:36.510" style="s2">researcher you always want to you always</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.710" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">want to say things that you only have</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.510" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">robust empirical evidence for and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">still doing the research on it but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:47.630" style="s2">I think I think the the evidence is now</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">mounting that this is the single most</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.630" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">pregnant moment for conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:54.390" style="s2">probably in history and also will play</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">some clips from Daniel smacked and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.390" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">Berger who we&#39;ve had on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:03:03.560" style="s2">before a lot of people have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">bias towards wanting certainty</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.560" end="00:03:12.150" style="s2">recognizing how big of an infinity the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">unknowable is everyone has to make very</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.150" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">deep friends with uncertainty to not be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:21.810" style="s2">mentally ill that doesn&#39;t mean that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:23.700" style="s2">have to do the move that all there is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.810" end="00:03:27.380" style="s2">uncertainty nothing can possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.700" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">known which is also gibberish because</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.380" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">the fact that I can&#39;t know anything with</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">perfect certainty doesn&#39;t mean that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">can&#39;t know things with much higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:38.730" style="s2">relative certainty I think the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about this over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.730" end="00:03:43.400" style="s2">last few days with a lot quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">energy because it&#39;s ramping up so much</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.400" end="00:03:47.580" style="s2">the more it&#39;s felt like something</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:48.870" style="s2">something that guests like in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.580" end="00:03:51.209" style="s2">Gilchrist&#39;s have said in the channel and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.870" end="00:03:53.130" style="s2">that we&#39;ve said a lot as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.209" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">that very often it&#39;s not the water it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.130" end="00:03:57.540" style="s2">the how and so what feels important</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:03:59.930" style="s2">right now to me in this information</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">ecology which is just mad crazy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:03.330" style="s2">narrative there&#39;s narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:05.820" style="s2">there&#39;s narratives flying around</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.330" end="00:04:07.380" style="s2">everywhere there&#39;s information there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.820" end="00:04:09.330" style="s2">misinformation it&#39;s it&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.380" end="00:04:11.010" style="s2">impossible to tell I think the question</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.330" end="00:04:12.840" style="s2">we should be asking is how do we arrive</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.010" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">at truth not what truth should we be</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.840" end="00:04:17.820" style="s2">arriving at I think part of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:19.980" style="s2">important is for individuals to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.820" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">having you know first all too hot start</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.980" end="00:04:23.729" style="s2">having our own discernment because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:25.979" style="s2">old gatekeepers of our information are</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.729" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">no longer reliable it means we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.979" end="00:04:29.009" style="s2">personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:32.069" style="s2">well I don&#39;t see a lot of right now on</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.009" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">any side of let&#39;s say what Peter</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.069" end="00:04:34.949" style="s2">Lindbergh is called the liminal war</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s happening the big information</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.949" end="00:04:41.009" style="s2">warfare is a an admission of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.599" style="s2">it almost seems like this desperate</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.009" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">anxious urge to get away from</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.599" end="00:04:46.770" style="s2">uncertainty at any cost</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">so it&#39;s either there are no conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.770" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">you&#39;re all mad or there are conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.880" style="s2">and this is what they definitely are so</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">that in between space isn&#39;t I think a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.880" end="00:04:59.130" style="s2">wishy-washy space it&#39;s it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:00.870" style="s2">realistic space to try and navigate but</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.130" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">much much harder there&#39;s another really</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:03.930" style="s2">good framing piece I think from one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">the people we featured on the channel</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.930" end="00:05:08.310" style="s2">quite a lot Jordan Hall where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:10.530" style="s2">about that in the process while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.310" end="00:05:13.009" style="s2">moving from like broadcast to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.530" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">decentralized media we&#39;re moving from</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.009" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">effectively a sort of TV world where</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:21.449" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of eternal that there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:36.360" style="s2">piece things together how many people</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.810" end="00:05:38.699" style="s2">used to know about actual conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.360" end="00:05:42.409" style="s2">that definitely happened Operation</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.699" end="00:05:46.020" style="s2">Paperclip Mockingbird like what was on</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.409" end="00:05:49.710" style="s2">COINTELPRO MKULTRA like things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.020" end="00:05:51.030" style="s2">actually happened before the internet</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.710" end="00:05:53.789" style="s2">the number of people that knew about</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.030" end="00:05:55.259" style="s2">those was probably pretty small it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.789" end="00:05:56.729" style="s2">almost like a cliche now they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.259" end="00:06:00.180" style="s2">like the great revealing or the great</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.729" end="00:06:02.250" style="s2">unveiling like there is clearly some</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.180" end="00:06:04.409" style="s2">truth in that there are things that</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.409" end="00:06:09.090" style="s2">be uncovered and that there are now</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.800" end="00:06:12.389" style="s2">paper trails like it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.090" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">difficult to hide your tracks completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.389" end="00:06:17.460" style="s2">in so many different areas so there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:18.990" style="s2">things that happened and that we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.460" end="00:06:21.570" style="s2">completely different landscape but then</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.990" end="00:06:24.169" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this also idea of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.570" end="00:06:26.820" style="s2">overactive pattern recognition or</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.169" end="00:06:28.139" style="s2">reading too much in which also happened</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.820" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">with John Vevey key we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.139" end="00:06:33.800" style="s2">really well it jives with a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">good cognitive science so Whitson</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.800" end="00:06:38.250" style="s2">Jennifer Whitson has done great</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.880" end="00:06:40.050" style="s2">experimental work showing the following</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.250" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">and think about how this this just links</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.050" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">up with everything I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:44.940" style="s2">if you put people in situations where</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:47.040" style="s2">they feel that they&#39;re losing control</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.940" end="00:06:48.690" style="s2">now she did very careful work to show</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.040" end="00:06:50.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that there&#39;s a threat</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.690" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">people if people have a threat and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.730" end="00:06:55.590" style="s2">feel that they can respond what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:57.360" style="s2">gonna talk about doesn&#39;t happen but if</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.590" end="00:06:59.070" style="s2">people feel that they&#39;re losing control</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.360" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">and you induce this in them you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.070" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">very experimentally then what will</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:05.100" style="s2">happen is they will tend they will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:07.350" style="s2">much more prone to seeing the losery</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.100" end="00:07:09.090" style="s2">patterns so if you give them noisy data</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.350" end="00:07:12.690" style="s2">they&#39;ll see faces in the data and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.090" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">they&#39;ll find patterns and and now</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.690" end="00:07:16.530" style="s2">directly she directly tested that when</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:18.780" style="s2">people are in those situations they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.530" end="00:07:21.090" style="s2">much more prone to believe in conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.780" end="00:07:24.150" style="s2">theories as well so what people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.090" end="00:07:25.800" style="s2">doing is it looks like right loss of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.150" end="00:07:28.830" style="s2">control and then what the brain does is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.800" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">ah find a pattern find a pattern find a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:33.540" style="s2">pattern find a part of make meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">because if you make meaning especially a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.540" end="00:07:37.890" style="s2">meaning that in which you play some role</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:39.900" style="s2">right like you have an important role</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.890" end="00:07:45.780" style="s2">you&#39;re the pure and there&#39;s the impure</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:47.610" style="s2">right then that will presumably afford</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.780" end="00:07:49.830" style="s2">the brain at least a pretense of being</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.610" end="00:07:52.260" style="s2">able to interact and start to regain</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.830" end="00:07:53.610" style="s2">control over its environment now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.260" end="00:07:57.410" style="s2">really really interesting because that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.610" end="00:08:00.870" style="s2">also lines up with a lot of work about</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.410" end="00:08:03.150" style="s2">you know hyper with that we can we that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.870" end="00:08:04.890" style="s2">we have an evolutionary predisposition</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.150" end="00:08:09.270" style="s2">to what&#39;s called hyperactive agency</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.890" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">detection so the idea is that when in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.270" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">our evolutionary background the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">detecting agents was really important</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.610" end="00:08:18.810" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to avoid being you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:21.210" style="s2">know something something something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.810" end="00:08:23.040" style="s2">food you&#39;re trying to find food you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.210" end="00:08:24.540" style="s2">trying to find human beings because they</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.040" end="00:08:27.930" style="s2">might be dangerous they might be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.540" end="00:08:29.640" style="s2">and so we&#39;re wired to overlook the over</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.930" end="00:08:32.790" style="s2">and compensate and we miss identify</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.640" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">faces and presences and spirits</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.790" end="00:08:36.390" style="s2">everywhere and so once again if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:38.550" style="s2">starting to look for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.390" end="00:08:40.710" style="s2">right and this hyperactive agency</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.550" end="00:08:43.740" style="s2">detectors cook kicking in people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.710" end="00:08:45.660" style="s2">gonna start positing hidden agencies</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.740" end="00:08:48.420" style="s2">behind things and that of course is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.660" end="00:08:51.690" style="s2">kind of thinking that loads you up for</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.420" end="00:08:54.030" style="s2">conspiracy theories and and this also</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.690" end="00:08:54.710" style="s2">jives with another thing like when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.030" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.710" end="00:08:57.890" style="s2">the left in the right hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.300" style="s2">remember that wonderful conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.890" end="00:09:01.000" style="s2">had with you and McGilchrist right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.300" end="00:09:04.790" style="s2">the left hemisphere is very you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.000" end="00:09:06.380" style="s2">certainty and step-by-step and precision</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:08.600" style="s2">and Andean has a lot of legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.380" end="00:09:10.040" style="s2">criticisms about being that too oriented</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.600" end="00:09:11.540" style="s2">but if you remember he did acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.040" end="00:09:12.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a dark side to the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.540" end="00:09:14.930" style="s2">hemisphere and here&#39;s where it is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.920" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">right hemisphere probably originally</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.930" end="00:09:21.649" style="s2">evolved for predation so it has wide</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:24.110" style="s2">open you know attention it tolerates</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.649" end="00:09:26.270" style="s2">ambiguity it&#39;s looking for threat and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.110" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s Gestalt it&#39;s grabbing at whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.270" end="00:09:30.230" style="s2">patterns it can so when we feel like</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.089" style="s2">we&#39;re being preyed upon the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.230" end="00:09:34.220" style="s2">hemisphere gets very active and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.089" end="00:09:36.260" style="s2">starts looking for hidden patterns you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:38.899" style="s2">see how all of these different adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.260" end="00:09:41.480" style="s2">features are all kicking in and then we</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.899" end="00:09:43.370" style="s2">have a cultural milieu and in an actual</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.480" end="00:09:46.040" style="s2">biological situation that is triggering</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.370" end="00:09:48.860" style="s2">a lot of this you know like I say</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:51.560" style="s2">mythopoetic thinking an ancient kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.860" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">biblical grammar and so I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.560" end="00:09:56.990" style="s2">concerned that you know this is a way in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:59.150" style="s2">which the meaning crisis right because</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.990" end="00:10:02.209" style="s2">of the way it&#39;s left people my enlarged</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.150" end="00:10:03.950" style="s2">very secularized very autodidactic and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.209" end="00:10:06.410" style="s2">fragmented in their spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.950" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">then in their religious education and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.410" end="00:10:10.279" style="s2">their wisdom training that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:11.630" style="s2">this stuff is gonna be triggered it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.279" end="00:10:13.490" style="s2">gonna come up and they&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.630" end="00:10:14.900" style="s2">able to monitor and manage it and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.490" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">conspiracy theories are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.900" end="00:10:19.730" style="s2">highly highly prevalent the brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:23.450" style="s2">prefers prediction over anything else</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.730" end="00:10:25.880" style="s2">right explanation so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.450" end="00:10:27.709" style="s2">people get very focused on ah this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.880" end="00:10:29.900" style="s2">this insight explains it all that makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.709" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">sense and give me gives me how I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.900" end="00:10:35.750" style="s2">deal with this and how I can translate</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:38.150" style="s2">my anxiety into fear and who&#39;s the hated</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.750" end="00:10:40.250" style="s2">object and who&#39;s the villain and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.150" end="00:10:41.959" style="s2">they do is that become super salient and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.250" end="00:10:43.880" style="s2">then they forget to counterbalance that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.959" end="00:10:47.480" style="s2">with yes but did my was my theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.880" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">generated by a lot of good independent</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.480" end="00:10:52.010" style="s2">lines of evidence and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:55.190" style="s2">hallmark of irrationality we get over</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.010" end="00:10:57.380" style="s2">fixated on how much we like the product</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.190" end="00:10:59.570" style="s2">of our cognition and we don&#39;t pay any</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.380" end="00:11:01.250" style="s2">attention to the processing by which</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.570" end="00:11:03.260" style="s2">that emerged and David that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.250" end="00:11:05.209" style="s2">especially dangerous with mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.260" end="00:11:08.050" style="s2">thought because we don&#39;t know where that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.209" end="00:11:10.570" style="s2">thinking emerges and it comes out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.050" end="00:11:12.610" style="s2">yes and we don&#39;t track it and presents</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.570" end="00:11:14.380" style="s2">itself as numinous to us it&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.610" end="00:11:16.330" style="s2">dangerous of this kind of plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.380" end="00:11:17.980" style="s2">bullshitting that we are that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.330" end="00:11:19.450" style="s2">liable to I think something that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.980" end="00:11:21.459" style="s2">bearing in mind right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.450" end="00:11:23.950" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in in this crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.459" end="00:11:26.410" style="s2">that we&#39;re not in normal state as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.950" end="00:11:29.290" style="s2">culture let&#39;s say we&#39;re in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.410" end="00:11:32.050" style="s2">strange altered state and that has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.290" end="00:11:33.970" style="s2">huge psychological impact and so I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.050" end="00:11:36.670" style="s2">a background in the psychedelic world</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.970" end="00:11:39.700" style="s2">and that is really a and oh and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.670" end="00:11:42.370" style="s2">other practices and many many of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.700" end="00:11:44.050" style="s2">practices are about experiencing an</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.370" end="00:11:46.149" style="s2">altered state and there&#39;s a specific way</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.050" end="00:11:48.730" style="s2">to navigate an altered state as well and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.149" end="00:11:50.230" style="s2">what standards have growth describes</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.730" end="00:11:52.810" style="s2">psychedelics as is nonspecific</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.230" end="00:11:54.760" style="s2">amplifiers which means that whatever&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.810" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">there already when you have it to have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.760" end="00:12:01.750" style="s2">psychedelic experience it&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">amplified massively right so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.750" end="00:12:04.750" style="s2">going through and this is a point</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:07.660" style="s2">Katherine MacLean has made really well</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.750" end="00:12:10.149" style="s2">is that what all the things that were in</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.589" end="00:12:18.130" style="s2">where we have to deal with a lot that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.130" end="00:12:22.089" style="s2">point really well that is like this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.959" end="00:12:23.890" style="s2">actually a time for us to look at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.089" end="00:12:25.570" style="s2">that stuff as is coming up it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.890" end="00:12:27.610" style="s2">a time for facing our demons and our</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.190" end="00:12:34.300" style="s2">similar point if we&#39;re in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:38.290" style="s2">space between worlds and what that means</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.300" end="00:12:40.510" style="s2">is that all of our imagined all of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.290" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">like imaginal as you could say all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.510" end="00:12:44.829" style="s2">our imaginal potential the things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:48.430" style="s2">we can imagine is heightened really</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.829" end="00:12:50.589" style="s2">really heightened that plays in a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.430" end="00:12:52.540" style="s2">to the kind of ideas and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.589" end="00:12:54.640" style="s2">possibilities that we can entertain and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.540" end="00:12:57.579" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.640" end="00:12:59.529" style="s2">during crises very often and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.579" end="00:13:01.420" style="s2">even adaptive because we need new</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.529" end="00:13:02.680" style="s2">solutions so there&#39;s a natural urge to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.420" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">consider things we&#39;ve never considered</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.680" end="00:13:05.740" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">so that really fits with something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.740" end="00:13:09.970" style="s2">Jules Evans the philosopher an author</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">wrote where he looked at kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.970" end="00:13:13.240" style="s2">communities that he&#39;s part of like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:15.910" style="s2">sort of spiritual alternative</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.240" end="00:13:17.410" style="s2">communities and seen kind of how a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.910" end="00:13:19.959" style="s2">of sense making had been breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.410" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">and came up this really good I thought a</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.959" end="00:13:23.140" style="s2">really good analogy between</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:25.380" style="s2">the two different ways of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.140" end="00:13:27.310" style="s2">world and there is some research that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.380" end="00:13:29.380" style="s2">people who are prone to conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.310" end="00:13:31.990" style="s2">theories score high in a personality</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.380" end="00:13:33.730" style="s2">trait called schizo typing which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.990" end="00:13:37.900" style="s2">basically you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re prone to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.730" end="00:13:40.930" style="s2">unusual beliefs and people who are drawn</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.900" end="00:13:44.680" style="s2">spirituality also score high in skits a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.930" end="00:13:47.010" style="s2">type II so so those are some of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.680" end="00:13:51.810" style="s2">of possible personality trait overlaps</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.010" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">but I also thought that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.810" end="00:13:58.180" style="s2">spirituality and conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:03.460" style="s2">come from a similar kind of historical</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.180" end="00:14:06.130" style="s2">culture and that culture is like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.460" end="00:14:09.070" style="s2">occult late 19th century early 20th</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.130" end="00:14:11.110" style="s2">century and occult which grew up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.070" end="00:14:14.200" style="s2">appeared at a similar kind of time to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.110" end="00:14:16.870" style="s2">now a time of breakdown in certainties</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.200" end="00:14:18.790" style="s2">breakdown in traditional authorities and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.870" end="00:14:21.880" style="s2">the time when a lot of people were dying</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.790" end="00:14:24.190" style="s2">because of the First World War and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.880" end="00:14:26.440" style="s2">was a time a liminal time with all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.190" end="00:14:30.730" style="s2">of new ideas and roads including ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.440" end="00:14:33.010" style="s2">around like the occult and what you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.730" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">in the occult is I guess you could think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.010" end="00:14:39.180" style="s2">of it as two different traditions or two</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:43.810" style="s2">different experiences one is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.180" end="00:14:46.150" style="s2">positive conspiracy which you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.810" end="00:14:48.970" style="s2">define by a kind of sort of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.150" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">experience like everything is connected</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.970" end="00:14:55.000" style="s2">I am connected to everything in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:57.580" style="s2">universe and that&#39;s wonderful the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.000" end="00:15:00.670" style="s2">universe&#39;s mission is flowing through me</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.580" end="00:15:04.690" style="s2">I am naturally attracting helpers to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.670" end="00:15:08.680" style="s2">kind of bring this new age this glorious</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.690" end="00:15:10.930" style="s2">new age for humanity into existence so</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.680" end="00:15:13.990" style="s2">you see lots of people in the occult in</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.930" end="00:15:18.120" style="s2">this kind of ecstatic of globalism I</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.990" end="00:15:22.270" style="s2">call that people like HG Wells or like</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.120" end="00:15:23.980" style="s2">Theosophists or you know in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.270" end="00:15:26.020" style="s2">New Age movement in the 70s and 80s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.980" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">there was a book by Marilyn Ferguson</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.020" end="00:15:31.510" style="s2">called the Aquarian conspiracy HG Wells</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:33.270" style="s2">wrote a book called the open conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.510" end="00:15:35.050" style="s2">and then these were like ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.270" end="00:15:39.400" style="s2">networked</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.050" end="00:15:41.620" style="s2">bolused progressive free love people and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.400" end="00:15:43.150" style="s2">they&#39;re like this is happening an age of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.620" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">love is happening it&#39;s happening through</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.150" end="00:15:48.580" style="s2">us we are the we are the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:50.890" style="s2">Vanguard we are the elite okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.580" end="00:15:54.100" style="s2">one what I call the positive conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.890" end="00:15:56.470" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the negative conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.100" end="00:15:59.410" style="s2">which kind of grew up in reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.470" end="00:16:02.230" style="s2">that and the negative it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.410" end="00:16:05.340" style="s2">the bad trip version of that good trip</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.230" end="00:16:07.990" style="s2">and it&#39;s like everything is connected</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.340" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an elite controlling everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.990" end="00:16:13.420" style="s2">but I&#39;m not included I&#39;m an outsider to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:16.870" style="s2">it so instead everything is connected</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.420" end="00:16:21.070" style="s2">and controlled by some shadowy elite of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.870" end="00:16:22.840" style="s2">self-appointed kind of masters and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.070" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re all kind of networked</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.840" end="00:16:26.410" style="s2">together in their own like think tanks</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:27.910" style="s2">and organizations and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.410" end="00:16:31.510" style="s2">controlling everything and they must be</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.910" end="00:16:33.820" style="s2">stalked and it&#39;s interesting that what</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.510" end="00:16:37.300" style="s2">you see in conspiracy theorists like</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.820" end="00:16:41.080" style="s2">Alex Jones say is they&#39;re really gunning</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.300" end="00:16:45.640" style="s2">for this kind of globalist dailies and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.080" end="00:16:48.310" style="s2">for example Alex Jones in 2010 came out</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.640" end="00:16:50.530" style="s2">a conspiracy theory that Bill Gates was</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.310" end="00:16:53.110" style="s2">only putting money into vaccines to try</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.530" end="00:16:56.640" style="s2">and lower the world population that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.110" end="00:16:59.560" style="s2">was a eugenics plan what&#39;s funny is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.640" end="00:17:02.380" style="s2">you know looking at the other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.560" end="00:17:05.050" style="s2">tradition of ecstatic globalists a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.380" end="00:17:08.050" style="s2">of them were into eugenics like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.050" end="00:17:11.980" style="s2">HG Wells Tejada Sharda Julian Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.050" end="00:17:14.950" style="s2">they were eugenicist so I guess what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.980" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">think is that these these two traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.950" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">the positive ecstatic euphoric globalist</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:26.380" style="s2">conspiracy and the negative paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:29.010" style="s2">anti-globalist conspiracy they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.380" end="00:17:33.220" style="s2">kind of two sides of the same coin</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.010" end="00:17:35.890" style="s2">they&#39;re the two aspects of a similar</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.220" end="00:17:37.720" style="s2">trip they&#39;re both prone to magical</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.890" end="00:17:39.370" style="s2">thinking they both see everything is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.720" end="00:17:42.130" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.370" end="00:17:45.580" style="s2">they both they&#39;re both ego distortions</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.130" end="00:17:47.980" style="s2">in a way in one of the ecstatic trip</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.580" end="00:17:49.330" style="s2">your ego is connected to everything and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.980" end="00:17:53.470" style="s2">you are superpower</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.330" end="00:17:55.179" style="s2">in the Paranoid trip you are connected</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.470" end="00:17:57.730" style="s2">to everything but you are at the mercy</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.179" end="00:17:59.559" style="s2">of these of these kind of superpowers</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.730" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting you talk about kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.559" end="00:18:03.429" style="s2">of a good trip and the bad trip and in</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">the david icke interview on london real</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.429" end="00:18:08.590" style="s2">he actually had both of those sections</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:10.900" style="s2">he had the kind of the beginning like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.590" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">the globalist the secret elite that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.900" end="00:18:15.730" style="s2">room in the world is evil cult and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">at the end very much sort of New Age my</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.730" end="00:18:19.780" style="s2">level of consciousness is bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.230" end="00:18:21.880" style="s2">theirs is we all need to kind of realize</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.780" end="00:18:24.159" style="s2">that we are God that we are copy of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.880" end="00:18:25.990" style="s2">consciousness those two things existing</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.159" end="00:18:29.289" style="s2">together at the same time in the space</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:31.230" style="s2">of like two hours yeah I think they come</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.289" end="00:18:37.990" style="s2">from a similar state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.230" end="00:18:40.900" style="s2">which is liminal archetypal magical</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.990" end="00:18:44.309" style="s2">mystical I have you if you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.900" end="00:18:46.390" style="s2">you know psychiatric speech schizotypal</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.309" end="00:18:48.580" style="s2">but I don&#39;t necessarily mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.390" end="00:18:51.640" style="s2">bad thing but you can see that someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.580" end="00:18:53.740" style="s2">can switch in in you know on</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.640" end="00:18:56.200" style="s2">psychedelics within the same trip even</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.740" end="00:18:57.700" style="s2">within the same hour from the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.200" end="00:19:00.940" style="s2">ecstatic euphoric</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.700" end="00:19:03.400" style="s2">I am the universe I am I am a super</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.630" end="00:19:13.270" style="s2">get me they being whoever the FBI the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.909" end="00:19:15.250" style="s2">Illuminati so and and there is that</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.370" end="00:21:23.320" style="s2">worth picking out you know not the what</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.760" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">are there those conspiracies going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.320" end="00:21:26.889" style="s2">are there unexplained things yes surely</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.889" end="00:21:30.309" style="s2">I don&#39;t it&#39;s not so much about the what</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.289" end="00:21:36.789" style="s2">and the similarities that we see when</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.500" end="00:21:47.470" style="s2">are a lot of similarities and those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.820" end="00:21:49.570" style="s2">I think really worth bearing in mind I</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.290" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">actually just an acceleration of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:16.330" style="s2">happening before the pandemic but but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:18.070" style="s2">different kind of groups of conspiracy</p>

<p begin="00:24:21.010" end="00:24:26.679" style="s2">of grand broad that profound kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.390" end="00:24:29.320" style="s2">series of allegations about how the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.679" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">world really works and not surprising at</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:33.330" style="s2">because I mean the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.620" end="00:24:34.980" style="s2">conspiracy theories the reason they</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.330" end="00:24:36.930" style="s2">exist and the reason they&#39;re created is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.980" end="00:24:39.900" style="s2">because of the joining dots so all you</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.930" end="00:24:42.150" style="s2">need to do is join more dots link more</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.900" end="00:24:44.700" style="s2">hidden motives identify more hidden</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.150" end="00:24:46.440" style="s2">groups and then suddenly kind of bridges</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.700" end="00:24:48.060" style="s2">can quite easily be built between</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.440" end="00:24:49.620" style="s2">conspiracy theories which initially</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.060" end="00:24:53.040" style="s2">started very far apart from each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.620" end="00:24:56.220" style="s2">mmm yeah and what&#39;s your sense cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.040" end="00:24:57.900" style="s2">very I&#39;m concerned about that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.220" end="00:25:00.390" style="s2">narrative usually from kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.900" end="00:25:01.800" style="s2">mainstream organs is how could anyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.390" end="00:25:06.930" style="s2">possibly believe in this and very</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.800" end="00:25:08.820" style="s2">dismissive which I think I mean I find</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.930" end="00:25:10.530" style="s2">that quite concerning because I think a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.820" end="00:25:14.030" style="s2">lot of people are suspicious of that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.530" end="00:25:16.980" style="s2">so how like my sense is that actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.030" end="00:25:19.320" style="s2">that the weak point in this is the level</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.980" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">of conviction that people tend to bring</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:26.430" style="s2">it from is a place of more uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.750" end="00:25:27.660" style="s2">like roundel uncertainty because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.430" end="00:25:30.690" style="s2">of it seems to have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.660" end="00:25:31.950" style="s2">religious fervor and then I do think</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.690" end="00:25:34.650" style="s2">there are some holes in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.950" end="00:25:36.330" style="s2">mainstream narratives at time so by</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.650" end="00:25:37.850" style="s2">saying no you&#39;ve just got to trust the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.330" end="00:25:40.590" style="s2">mainstream isn&#39;t there a danger there</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.850" end="00:25:44.910" style="s2">yes there&#39;s a lot of problems which</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.590" end="00:25:47.880" style="s2">simply reacting to this as as the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.910" end="00:25:49.950" style="s2">product of a series of crackpots firstly</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.880" end="00:25:51.450" style="s2">like this sheer scale of this these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.950" end="00:25:54.090" style="s2">not just a few crackpots these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.450" end="00:25:58.770" style="s2">millions of our fellow Britons across</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.090" end="00:26:00.870" style="s2">the country the idea that people and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.770" end="00:26:02.520" style="s2">have to be kind of crazy or not to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.870" end="00:26:04.050" style="s2">believe in conspiracy theories is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.520" end="00:26:05.730" style="s2">second problem you know this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.050" end="00:26:07.350" style="s2">pathologizing it and trying to turn it</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.730" end="00:26:08.760" style="s2">into a mental illness which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.350" end="00:26:11.550" style="s2">obviously sits kind of Foursquare</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.760" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">against the general kind of like urging</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.550" end="00:26:15.630" style="s2">that we all have on each other which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.490" style="s2">the kind of be skeptical independently</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.630" end="00:26:20.310" style="s2">minded systems and that we always need</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.490" end="00:26:22.920" style="s2">that within a democratic society and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.310" end="00:26:25.140" style="s2">also that there is a in a world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.920" end="00:26:29.010" style="s2">so unequal that we&#39;re talking about kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.140" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">of the 1% and the point of 1% in some</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.010" end="00:26:34.350" style="s2">ways metaphorically it seems true that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:35.820" style="s2">your life has beyond your control it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.350" end="00:26:37.830" style="s2">being organized by people who have an</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.820" end="00:26:40.140" style="s2">enormous amount of power so to actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.830" end="00:26:42.210" style="s2">kind of turn that into a narrative about</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.140" end="00:26:43.890" style="s2">the world is not that far off how it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.210" end="00:26:46.980" style="s2">feels to be in</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.890" end="00:26:49.680" style="s2">usually unequal society in a way no and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.980" end="00:26:51.270" style="s2">I think actually the best explanation</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.680" end="00:26:55.260" style="s2">that I&#39;ve ever come across for</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.270" end="00:26:57.210" style="s2">conspiracy theorizing is that it is a a</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.260" end="00:27:00.570" style="s2">ideological response to structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.210" end="00:27:01.980" style="s2">inequality and I think that very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.570" end="00:27:03.350" style="s2">when you look at where conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.980" end="00:27:06.710" style="s2">theories bloom they bloom in inequality</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.350" end="00:27:09.000" style="s2">inequalities of information and of power</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.710" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">societies which are more unequal and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.000" end="00:27:13.260" style="s2">tend to be much less resilient to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:18.270" style="s2">conspiracy theories than ones which are</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.260" end="00:27:19.980" style="s2">more equal so yeah I mean but I think in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.270" end="00:27:21.660" style="s2">many ways then like what conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.980" end="00:27:25.170" style="s2">theory actually is is like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.660" end="00:27:28.530" style="s2">personification of a more generalized</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.170" end="00:27:30.630" style="s2">sense that there are agencies and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.530" end="00:27:33.090" style="s2">and powers in one&#39;s life which one kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.630" end="00:27:35.670" style="s2">of control which is a very human</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.090" end="00:27:37.770" style="s2">response but of course in some in many</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.670" end="00:27:38.940" style="s2">cases a flawed one - there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.770" end="00:27:41.250" style="s2">things that are becoming kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.940" end="00:27:44.250" style="s2">viscerally clear to people right now one</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.250" end="00:27:46.800" style="s2">of which is that there does seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.250" end="00:27:48.330" style="s2">similarity between the spread of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.800" end="00:27:51.030" style="s2">virus and the spread of kind of viral</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.330" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">misinformation and that sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.030" end="00:27:55.140" style="s2">definitely feels similar and also this</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:27:57.750" style="s2">sense that we&#39;re all publishers</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.140" end="00:28:01.530" style="s2">I suddenly I think people are realizing</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.750" end="00:28:02.700" style="s2">we all have and somehow in some sense I</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.530" end="00:28:04.680" style="s2">think we all need to learn some</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.700" end="00:28:06.630" style="s2">discernment we all need to learn do I</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.680" end="00:28:08.970" style="s2">share this do I check this out like</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.630" end="00:28:11.220" style="s2">we&#39;re all publishers now like every</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.970" end="00:28:12.870" style="s2">everyone is is a vector of potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.220" end="00:28:15.900" style="s2">transmission of misinformation to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.870" end="00:28:18.260" style="s2">someone else right I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.900" end="00:28:20.580" style="s2">accident that we&#39;ve long used</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.260" end="00:28:22.740" style="s2">epidemiological metaphors in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.580" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">understand the Internet yeah virality</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.740" end="00:28:26.220" style="s2">being that the best one but but</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:29.160" style="s2">definitely the idea that both</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.220" end="00:28:31.050" style="s2">information and behavior infectious you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.160" end="00:28:32.790" style="s2">know and they spread across networks and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.050" end="00:28:34.860" style="s2">we are vectors these are all these are</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.790" end="00:28:36.510" style="s2">all ideas which kind of academic studies</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.860" end="00:28:39.570" style="s2">have long use to understand how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.510" end="00:28:41.400" style="s2">internet really works and as as</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.570" end="00:28:42.870" style="s2">publishers you know I mean and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.400" end="00:28:45.030" style="s2">something that I guess we we called</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.870" end="00:28:47.010" style="s2">foreign demos in 2012 but but could</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.030" end="00:28:47.880" style="s2">never really managed to quite get on the</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:51.810" style="s2">and we do have kind of digital</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.100" end="00:28:53.630" style="s2">citizenship requirements we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.810" end="00:28:58.050" style="s2">responsibilities to one another and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.630" end="00:29:00.390" style="s2">which and again probably now more than</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.050" end="00:29:03.770" style="s2">never are easier to forget that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.390" end="00:29:06.390" style="s2">got and are easier to ignore you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.770" end="00:29:08.280" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly moments like this when</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.390" end="00:29:10.740" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of acting really fast you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.280" end="00:29:13.050" style="s2">know we are acting quite impulsively</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.740" end="00:29:14.970" style="s2">online and we&#39;re probably spending more</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.050" end="00:29:16.940" style="s2">time online than we&#39;ve had in we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.970" end="00:29:18.540" style="s2">in the past we&#39;re probably living in</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.940" end="00:29:20.460" style="s2">environment online which are quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.540" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">unfamiliar to us and these are exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.460" end="00:29:24.270" style="s2">the moments when we can find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:27.090" style="s2">kind of spreading information to each</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.270" end="00:29:28.860" style="s2">other which actually if we were to pause</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.090" end="00:29:31.740" style="s2">and consider for a moment and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.860" end="00:29:34.770" style="s2">probably regard as being harmful but</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.740" end="00:29:36.030" style="s2">very interesting ly you know much as</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.770" end="00:29:38.340" style="s2">lots of people have been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.030" end="00:29:40.110" style="s2">contacting me to talk about a relative</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.340" end="00:29:42.050" style="s2">or a friend that suddenly taken this</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.110" end="00:29:45.450" style="s2">kind of conspiratorial leap</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.050" end="00:29:46.830" style="s2">they&#39;ve come they kind of like as I talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.450" end="00:29:48.630" style="s2">to them about it there&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.830" end="00:29:50.040" style="s2">which is very interesting which becomes</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.630" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">clear which is that when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.040" end="00:29:54.030" style="s2">challenged on the information there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:57.300" style="s2">that there&#39;s a common response which is</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.300" end="00:30:03.270" style="s2">thought it was and worth sharing you</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.660" end="00:30:06.030" style="s2">know the idea that there&#39;s more harm in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.270" end="00:30:09.510" style="s2">not sharing a possible pieces to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.030" end="00:30:11.660" style="s2">information than there is in carrying a</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.660" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very very common response</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.160" end="00:30:18.780" style="s2">which lots of people have lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:20.490" style="s2">have sent to me which I think like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.780" end="00:30:21.690" style="s2">probably a massive misconception with</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.490" end="00:30:24.090" style="s2">how information works and what</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.690" end="00:30:26.430" style="s2">information can do information is not</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.980" end="00:30:32.460" style="s2">biggest flick there&#39;s one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:34.200" style="s2">suggestion I would happen to me as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.460" end="00:30:35.400" style="s2">as to everyone else because I&#39;m by no</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.200" end="00:30:37.230" style="s2">means a perfect representative of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.400" end="00:30:40.650" style="s2">but we need to kind of view information</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.930" end="00:31:10.970" style="s2">as a conspiracy they either just kind of</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.610" end="00:31:32.260" style="s2">to do dis info right like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.050" end="00:31:38.450" style="s2">doing that for a thousand years pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.260" end="00:31:40.280" style="s2">intelligently and coordinated lis and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.450" end="00:31:42.380" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how easy it is for</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.280" end="00:31:43.670" style="s2">people to reject something as oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.380" end="00:31:46.730" style="s2">dumb conspiracy thinking when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.670" end="00:31:48.470" style="s2">actually study history then on the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.730" end="00:31:50.210" style="s2">hand there are people who if they hear</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.470" end="00:31:52.310" style="s2">any conspiracy they assume it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.210" end="00:31:55.130" style="s2">true and if they hear that anything came</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.310" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">from a authoritative institution they</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.130" end="00:31:58.940" style="s2">assume it&#39;s probably corrupt and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:00.200" style="s2">also completely silly because if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.940" end="00:32:02.690" style="s2">groups were that corrupt they would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.200" end="00:32:04.820" style="s2">overturned so I see that same weird</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.690" end="00:32:06.350" style="s2">certainty on both the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.820" end="00:32:10.610" style="s2">theorist and the anti conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.350" end="00:32:13.580" style="s2">theorists like there&#39;s this in-group</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.610" end="00:32:17.650" style="s2">thing where one is it would be so bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.580" end="00:32:20.390" style="s2">for my in-group if I was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.650" end="00:32:24.140" style="s2">critical thinking anti conspiracy camp</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.390" end="00:32:26.420" style="s2">and I started saying you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.140" end="00:32:28.700" style="s2">there really is such and such that</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.420" end="00:32:31.370" style="s2">there&#39;s pretty strong incentives other</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.700" end="00:32:35.810" style="s2">than just clear thinking against it see</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.370" end="00:32:38.570" style="s2">a real focus for both Carl and John was</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.810" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s a mistake almost I&#39;d like take</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.570" end="00:32:43.400" style="s2">on the beliefs themselves it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:45.170" style="s2">really about that it&#39;s about how we come</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.400" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">to those beliefs in the first place I</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.170" end="00:32:51.110" style="s2">mean what I see from a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:52.580" style="s2">mainstream organs like the media is like</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.110" end="00:32:54.680" style="s2">how can these people possibly believe</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.580" end="00:32:56.090" style="s2">this this is just ridiculous and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.680" end="00:32:57.950" style="s2">just seems very young compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.090" end="00:32:59.810" style="s2">that&#39;s not how you would react to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.950" end="00:33:02.090" style="s2">someone in your family who was who was</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.810" end="00:33:04.040" style="s2">deluded so how do we how do we engage</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.090" end="00:33:05.330" style="s2">with people it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.040" end="00:33:08.090" style="s2">uncompassionate I&#39;m going to be harsher</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.330" end="00:33:10.220" style="s2">David it&#39;s stupid because it&#39;s it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.090" end="00:33:12.200" style="s2">maintain the very wrong framing it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.220" end="00:33:15.230" style="s2">point at the product and say bad product</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.200" end="00:33:18.650" style="s2">bad product bad product Oh bad product</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.230" end="00:33:21.230" style="s2">and and not acknowledge the power of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.650" end="00:33:23.420" style="s2">this adaptive machinery there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.230" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">why people are making use of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.420" end="00:33:27.289" style="s2">because it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:29.149" style="s2">maladaptive it&#39;s this powerful adapter</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.289" end="00:33:30.679" style="s2">machinery and just yelling at them first</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.149" end="00:33:32.929" style="s2">of all gets them even more strongly</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.679" end="00:33:35.179" style="s2">focused on the product and diverts them</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.929" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">from possibly paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.179" end="00:33:39.620" style="s2">process so it just exacerbates things</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">then secondly its itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.620" end="00:33:43.820" style="s2">disingenuous because it&#39;s not paying</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.590" style="s2">attention to the reality of the power of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.820" end="00:33:46.760" style="s2">this adaptive machinery and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.590" end="00:33:48.740" style="s2">engaging with what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.760" end="00:33:50.450" style="s2">fundamental attribution error instead of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.740" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">paying attention to the process in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.450" end="00:33:55.580" style="s2">context you&#39;re just saying oh what a</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">stupid person right and that is not the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.580" end="00:33:59.330" style="s2">appropriate thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:01.730" style="s2">so in fact I would suggest not</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.330" end="00:34:04.340" style="s2">challenging people directly under</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.730" end="00:34:06.590" style="s2">conspiracy I would say can you get them</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.340" end="00:34:08.570" style="s2">involved with other practices that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.590" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">trigger that same adaptive rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.570" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">machinery but in a healthy manner that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:14.990" style="s2">orient them like the Stoics did towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:18.470" style="s2">the meaning making process this is why</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.990" end="00:34:20.419" style="s2">I&#39;m offering the meditations right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.470" end="00:34:23.210" style="s2">gonna go out and challenged you know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.419" end="00:34:25.339" style="s2">know 5g is causing you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.210" end="00:34:27.320" style="s2">coronavirus because you can&#39;t when</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.339" end="00:34:30.429" style="s2">people are locked into that parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.320" end="00:34:33.409" style="s2">processing it takes a law a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.429" end="00:34:35.570" style="s2">interaction but instead if I can say</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.409" end="00:34:37.369" style="s2">well you know you&#39;re under stress and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.570" end="00:34:39.020" style="s2">this sounds like I&#39;m conning them but</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.369" end="00:34:41.510" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;m trying to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.020" end="00:34:42.980" style="s2">like you understood come over here and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.510" end="00:34:44.810" style="s2">learn to meditate and learn to</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.980" end="00:34:46.339" style="s2">contemplate and maybe learn to get into</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.810" end="00:34:48.200" style="s2">the flow state with doing some Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.339" end="00:34:49.909" style="s2">and notice how these things orient you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.200" end="00:34:51.349" style="s2">towards your processing and then take a</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.909" end="00:34:54.139" style="s2">deeper and then people start to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.349" end="00:34:55.940" style="s2">other kinds of insights that can compete</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.139" end="00:34:58.330" style="s2">with the conspiracy insights and their</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.940" end="00:35:01.400" style="s2">insights of meaning making rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.330" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">maladaptive meaning projection I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.400" end="00:35:07.099" style="s2">that&#39;s what you have to do but I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:08.750" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of a meta move of how do I</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.099" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">come to these conclusions in the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.750" end="00:35:13.010" style="s2">place after paying attention to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:15.080" style="s2">going on and how what the processes of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.010" end="00:35:17.270" style="s2">coming to these conclusions but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.080" end="00:35:18.500" style="s2">directly point people there right</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.270" end="00:35:20.119" style="s2">because if you just say turn around and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.500" end="00:35:22.849" style="s2">look at your processing they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.119" end="00:35:25.010" style="s2">burn right that&#39;s not gonna work so what</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.849" end="00:35:26.540" style="s2">you have to do is get them a trap you</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.010" end="00:35:28.220" style="s2">have to this is what I talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.540" end="00:35:29.720" style="s2">this is the aesthetics you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.220" end="00:35:32.359" style="s2">beautify for them you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.720" end="00:35:35.510" style="s2">beautiful for them paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.359" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">the process reflecting on how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.510" end="00:35:41.000" style="s2">coming to their</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.620" style="s2">insights and finding insights of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.000" end="00:35:45.020" style="s2">meaning-making as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.620" end="00:35:47.300" style="s2">insights of control valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.020" end="00:35:48.290" style="s2">beautiful and tasty to the mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.300" end="00:35:50.120" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.290" end="00:35:51.740" style="s2">so is your sense that the things are</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.120" end="00:35:52.340" style="s2">going to get worse before they get</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.740" end="00:35:56.840" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.340" end="00:35:58.790" style="s2">Oh like I was saying I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.840" end="00:36:01.580" style="s2">know on the heels of the kool-aid crisis</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.790" end="00:36:04.100" style="s2">there is a meaning mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.580" end="00:36:05.480" style="s2">of tzunami perforce proportions coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.100" end="00:36:06.620" style="s2">because you know because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.480" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">happening to people is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.620" end="00:36:13.130" style="s2">relationships are being destroyed their</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">identities are being challenged you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.130" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">their their patterns and routines the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:20.990" style="s2">ways they sort of kept themselves busy</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:22.610" style="s2">are being disrupted in and and they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.990" end="00:36:24.260" style="s2">they&#39;re getting a very clear sense that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.610" end="00:36:27.290" style="s2">things aren&#39;t going to go back the old</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.260" end="00:36:29.510" style="s2">normal right so their worldview the sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.290" end="00:36:31.340" style="s2">of the obvious nosov common sense has</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.510" end="00:36:37.970" style="s2">been significantly challenged so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.340" end="00:36:39.860" style="s2">think I think that we&#39;re gonna face like</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.970" end="00:36:43.370" style="s2">the meaning crisis the mental health</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.860" end="00:36:45.020" style="s2">crisis on meth and that&#39;s coming and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.370" end="00:36:46.700" style="s2">it&#39;s already I&#39;ve already noticed it so</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.020" end="00:36:48.260" style="s2">I have no scientific data I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.700" end="00:36:50.870" style="s2">collect it right now right but</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.260" end="00:36:53.690" style="s2">anecdotally you know in the network</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.870" end="00:36:58.430" style="s2">people are starting to report this this</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.690" end="00:37:02.360" style="s2">sort of looming sense of not quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.430" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">having the a confident grip on you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.360" end="00:37:08.360" style="s2">reality things people are saying this a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.490" end="00:37:10.670" style="s2">lot everything feels surreal right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.360" end="00:37:12.770" style="s2">hearing that a law this feels surreal</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.670" end="00:37:14.270" style="s2">and that&#39;s not said like pleasantly like</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.770" end="00:37:15.590" style="s2">a daughter like some sort of Dali</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.270" end="00:37:18.470" style="s2">painting is the glue</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.590" end="00:37:21.560" style="s2">you know nightmarish surreal and and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.470" end="00:37:25.900" style="s2">and they&#39;re talking about that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.560" end="00:37:29.510" style="s2">also you know a kind of nebulous dread</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.900" end="00:37:32.870" style="s2">and those are very foreboding for</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.510" end="00:37:35.510" style="s2">warnings that you know people&#39;s mental</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.870" end="00:37:38.630" style="s2">health is gonna be challenged in very</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.510" end="00:37:39.890" style="s2">powerful ways yeah and you I think</p>
