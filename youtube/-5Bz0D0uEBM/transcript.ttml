<p begin="00:00:09.889" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">investigating this kind of spirituality</p>

<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">called spiritual atheist so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:23.990" style="s2">is a really interesting place to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">there just been some very high-profile</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.159" end="00:01:10.979" style="s2">really a walk as it&#39;s two positions and</p>

<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">very specific type of atheism I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.969" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">focused on matter and it hasn&#39;t ever</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">and I believe spiritual a theism is I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.500" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">guess evidence-based the evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:23.610" style="s2">science is obvious I don&#39;t have to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.130" style="s2">into that net source of atheist evidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:27.810" style="s2">base but I believe that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.130" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">evidence base for spiritual experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.810" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">which is millions of years of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:33.960" style="s2">thousands of years of traditions</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:37.020" style="s2">exploring if you go inside crying you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.020" end="00:02:41.880" style="s2">access this heart area which I will call</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">the metaphor nursery of the heart but</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.880" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">the experience of thinking from here not</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">from hit this little bit here then</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">evidence the evidence shows you that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">will experience some form of unity</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:57.140" style="s2">ecstatic or quiet continuation into</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.140" end="00:03:02.220" style="s2">which is transformational it changes</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.250" end="00:03:03.270" style="s2">everything about your life the one is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.220" end="00:03:04.350" style="s2">spirit whatever you wanna call it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.270" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">however you get there and there&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.350" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">different ways to get there</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:08.970" style="s2">but it does once you&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">experience it becomes a organizing truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">that then re aligns everything around it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">and what I had to do myself as how do I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">make peace with this becoming the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:20.130" style="s2">organizing principle of my inner life</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">but still have science being the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.130" end="00:03:24.570" style="s2">organizing principle of the external</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:26.880" style="s2">world which I don&#39;t argue with because</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.570" end="00:03:28.830" style="s2">it&#39;s brilliant that&#39;s what I&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.880" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">been working on is how do you transcend</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.830" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">those two positions because always you</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:36.209" style="s2">get just talking pastor you get the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:38.420" style="s2">Atheist staying an atheist maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.209" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">admit to meditation being useful from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.420" end="00:03:44.600" style="s2">instrumental sense of stress and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:46.709" style="s2">whatever and maybe they admit to ritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.600" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">being really good and like you get the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.709" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">kind of new churches the Atheist</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.170" style="s2">churches but when the congregation comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:54.450" style="s2">but they won&#39;t ever admit to a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.170" end="00:03:56.130" style="s2">truth and then you get the richest</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.450" end="00:03:59.310" style="s2">person going well I just believe in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:01.350" style="s2">kind of revealed truth and science is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.310" end="00:04:04.440" style="s2">useful and everything and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.350" end="00:04:08.360" style="s2">right you have to find a way to lift</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.440" end="00:04:10.500" style="s2">them higher which is ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.360" end="00:04:11.730" style="s2">spirituality or wisdom is about which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.500" end="00:04:13.799" style="s2">about finding opposites and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.730" end="00:04:18.030" style="s2">bringing them into harmony with each</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.799" end="00:04:20.340" style="s2">other as Heraclitus one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.030" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">pre-socratic Greek philosophers said you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.340" end="00:04:23.710" style="s2">think those things are different but</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:25.889" style="s2">actually they&#39;re part of one thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.710" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">and he called it a Pavan tonic harmony</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.889" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">create attention and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">job is how do I get myself every</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:37.270" style="s2">individual how do I get to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:38.940" style="s2">I can embrace what science has to say it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.270" end="00:04:42.250" style="s2">really does work it&#39;s really useful</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.940" end="00:04:43.750" style="s2">keeps us alive but it can never answer</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.250" end="00:04:45.130" style="s2">questions about this thing it does tell</p>

<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:53.080" style="s2">saying that even the consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.080" end="00:04:57.460" style="s2">and write my book is an illusion you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">know that&#39;s something not right there</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.460" end="00:05:00.220" style="s2">you know it just doesn&#39;t it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.620" end="00:05:09.009" style="s2">things through to the logical logical</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.789" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">conclusion and isn&#39;t scared of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.009" end="00:05:14.830" style="s2">conclusions he&#39;s reached it&#39;s like yes</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.060" end="00:05:42.310" style="s2">interesting about the times now because</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.090" end="00:05:44.199" style="s2">certainly online and I think also in in</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.870" end="00:06:33.219" style="s2">interesting time it feels like there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:35.560" style="s2">an opportunity for a new synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.219" end="00:06:37.380" style="s2">arising which is why I think the</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.060" end="00:06:57.930" style="s2">perform better and yeah it&#39;s a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.220" end="00:06:59.160" style="s2">line for me to be talking about some of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.930" end="00:07:00.690" style="s2">these content because there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.830" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">conversation same with leaders you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.300" end="00:08:15.720" style="s2">fine line but what I&#39;ve noticed in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.650" end="00:08:17.970" style="s2">last two or three years is I&#39;m now I</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.720" end="00:08:20.850" style="s2">almost void it more than I need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.970" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">because people are asking me but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.850" end="00:08:27.570" style="s2">you mean talking about love but I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:30.450" style="s2">use it until use it but but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.570" end="00:08:31.620" style="s2">demand there&#39;s a yearning and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.450" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">the challenge I think I&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.620" end="00:08:34.890" style="s2">at the moment is how do we ensure in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:37.469" style="s2">world without religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.890" end="00:08:39.060" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m quite active religious I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.469" end="00:08:41.490" style="s2">that part of my mother militant atheism</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.060" end="00:08:44.130" style="s2">is very much alive in me it&#39;s if I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.490" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">any kind of rulebook anyone saying this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.130" end="00:08:48.990" style="s2">is the pathway rather than a pathway</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">this is the model and you see it across</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.990" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">the whole parcel developments</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:53.709" style="s2">spiritual space is you see people</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:55.240" style="s2">hurrying towards religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.709" end="00:08:58.600" style="s2">you see people putting people into guru</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.240" end="00:08:59.949" style="s2">/ priest mode so I&#39;m like that stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.600" end="00:09:01.660" style="s2">feel like sick with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.949" end="00:09:04.180" style="s2">so for me the question is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.660" end="00:09:08.019" style="s2">reinsure in the world without religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.180" end="00:09:09.009" style="s2">in its to organize sense it has to come</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.019" end="00:09:12.490" style="s2">from individual it has to come from</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.009" end="00:09:13.870" style="s2">inside and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s the I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.490" end="00:09:17.500" style="s2">think it&#39;s a great topic of the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.870" end="00:09:18.939" style="s2">20-30 years and another really</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.500" end="00:09:21.240" style="s2">interesting topic you&#39;ve talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.939" end="00:09:23.769" style="s2">the past is the idea of the J curve</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.240" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">which is something I think is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.769" end="00:09:29.529" style="s2">relevance now especially where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:32.230" style="s2">us have the sense that things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.529" end="00:09:33.910" style="s2">breaking down and I&#39;ll let you explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.230" end="00:09:35.949" style="s2">the Jay Cove in more detail but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.910" end="00:09:37.240" style="s2">is that you cannot move from one state</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.949" end="00:09:39.819" style="s2">to another without going through a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.240" end="00:09:41.139" style="s2">dissolution and a lot of people struggle</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.819" end="00:09:43.480" style="s2">with that dissolution because I say</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.139" end="00:09:45.970" style="s2">we&#39;re here we want to move to here yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.480" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">but you have to britainís this goes with</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.970" end="00:09:49.660" style="s2">personal growth as well if you want if</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">you want to improve how you are in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.660" end="00:09:54.430" style="s2">world and you have to give up you&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:58.060" style="s2">some parts of your personality that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.430" end="00:09:59.949" style="s2">we&#39;re working okay go into chaos before</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.060" end="00:10:01.660" style="s2">you can come out the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.949" end="00:10:03.449" style="s2">that&#39;s a really interesting subject I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.660" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2">think it&#39;s a really interesting model</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.449" end="00:10:08.920" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a I think it&#39;s an essential</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.180" end="00:10:09.639" style="s2">thing for people to know if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.920" end="00:10:12.310" style="s2">change anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.639" end="00:10:14.680" style="s2">expect them to get worse first can you</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.310" end="00:10:16.360" style="s2">can you can you describe that so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.680" end="00:10:20.230" style="s2">tradition the material a of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.360" end="00:10:22.689" style="s2">change is linear so as you say you want</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.230" end="00:10:24.339" style="s2">thing I&#39;m here now my life&#39;s okay my</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.339" end="00:10:27.490" style="s2">not really conscious and that really</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:29.050" style="s2">juicy I want to make them more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.490" end="00:10:33.819" style="s2">and juicy I just wanna go from here to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.050" end="00:10:35.769" style="s2">here and the great tragicomedy of life</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.819" end="00:10:37.899" style="s2">does I believe it&#39;s designed in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.769" end="00:10:40.059" style="s2">prevented by who go into that core topic</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.899" end="00:10:42.569" style="s2">but it&#39;s designed into our system human</p>

<p begin="00:11:02.810" end="00:11:06.470" style="s2">movement is the dissolution as you say</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.700" end="00:11:08.660" style="s2">of old archetypes of our personality</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.490" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">because ultimately all if you stay in</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:15.500" style="s2">one tradition you end up having to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:16.789" style="s2">the shadow work because that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.570" end="00:18:25.669" style="s2">I think new a jury has gone in has just</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.929" end="00:18:28.610" style="s2">avoided it all and that&#39;s why so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.669" end="00:18:31.730" style="s2">atheists look at it and go what a pile</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.610" end="00:18:33.770" style="s2">of mumbo jumbo nonsense but also I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.730" end="00:18:35.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a it&#39;s partly that but I also</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.770" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">think they put off by the kind of people</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.289" end="00:18:48.289" style="s2">of that it&#39;s so much hypocrisy involved</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.559" end="00:18:49.850" style="s2">so by people who are only doing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.289" end="00:18:51.049" style="s2">bliss out thing and not doing the inner</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.850" end="00:18:53.510" style="s2">work I&#39;m not doing the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.530" end="00:19:01.400" style="s2">that if the whole thing is a trip of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.539" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">of a blissful ego and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.400" end="00:19:05.900" style="s2">Christianity for example or the older</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:07.970" style="s2">wisdom traditions that do integrate that</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.970" end="00:19:11.539" style="s2">have stories like Cain and Abel this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.220" end="00:19:13.940" style="s2">what happens if you get this resentful</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.539" end="00:19:16.429" style="s2">this is how this is what resentment</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.940" end="00:19:18.679" style="s2">begins being which in itself is a</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.380" end="00:19:24.260" style="s2">the people act in the world is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.580" end="00:19:28.280" style="s2">reflection of a deeper theological truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.260" end="00:19:30.950" style="s2">was something that really I guess</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.280" end="00:19:32.600" style="s2">reawakened in me a kind of respect for</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.950" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">those with</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.600" end="00:19:35.800" style="s2">traditions hmm including Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.800" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">interesting I guess Chris I see</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:42.830" style="s2">ironically of all the resolutions the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.650" style="s2">wine least know about I think growing up</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.830" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">as a Jew in a Christian society didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.650" end="00:19:49.190" style="s2">massively</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:50.900" style="s2">enamor meter to the path but also</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.190" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">listening to the but also many of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.900" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">stories are in the Jewish tradition what</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:56.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the bit that uh me off the old</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.470" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2">look at those texts and I can see wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.490" style="s2">in them but when they&#39;re taken literally</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:09.010" style="s2">and the connotation versus the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.490" end="00:20:11.960" style="s2">denotation really when they&#39;re taken</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.010" end="00:20:13.970" style="s2">dinner you know the when we when we take</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.960" end="00:20:15.740" style="s2">the story of the story which is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.970" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">most religions of the book actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.740" end="00:20:20.510" style="s2">still do they take the story as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:22.790" style="s2">story and miss out the metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.510" end="00:20:24.800" style="s2">narrative mythic meanings that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.790" end="00:20:26.690" style="s2">actually the interesting bits for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.800" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">it&#39;s just a big no thank you not</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.690" end="00:20:30.620" style="s2">interested in any of that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">sense to me at all but I&#39;ve read a</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.750" end="00:20:57.670" style="s2">really important that there&#39;s an access</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.700" end="00:21:12.710" style="s2">in a time where so if the if the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.540" end="00:21:14.420" style="s2">were a time where we started becoming</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.710" end="00:21:15.740" style="s2">really aware of the Eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.420" end="00:21:19.460" style="s2">for the first time kind of integration</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.740" end="00:21:21.350" style="s2">of taoism buddhism hinduism if there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.460" end="00:21:22.910" style="s2">another awakening happening now and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.350" end="00:21:26.530" style="s2">think areas and I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.910" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">seeing is an integration of the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.530" end="00:21:30.760" style="s2">Western traditions at a deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">Christian mysticism being one of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.760" end="00:21:34.370" style="s2">probably the esoteric tradition and new</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:37.310" style="s2">interest in that because we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.370" end="00:21:38.420" style="s2">seeing a lot of things bubbling up</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.310" end="00:21:39.800" style="s2">through the kind of corners in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.420" end="00:21:42.200" style="s2">culture which is a really interesting</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.520" end="00:21:54.840" style="s2">own culture yes yes I mean if we think</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.490" end="00:21:56.730" style="s2">about the Western tradition you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.840" end="00:21:58.770" style="s2">against this dialectic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.730" end="00:22:00.600" style="s2">flip-flopping between external focus and</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.060" end="00:22:15.450" style="s2">right my hope is that we don&#39;t flip-flop</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.290" end="00:22:17.430" style="s2">again and I think one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.450" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve got in ours of our society is we</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.430" end="00:22:22.950" style="s2">have this pendulum that goes patriarchy</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.950" end="00:22:25.470" style="s2">just flip-flop between these extremes</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:29.850" style="s2">and there&#39;s never goodness in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.470" end="00:22:33.330" style="s2">extremes and my hope is we don&#39;t do what</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.850" end="00:22:35.430" style="s2">we did in the 60s which we gave up the</p>
