<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sort of a</p>

<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:03.760" style="s2">this is very similar to what i say about</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.760" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">you might set up a particular ritual</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">context perhaps maybe once a week</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">where you&#39;re listening to music while</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">doing mindfulness</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">because if you&#39;re listening to music</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">while you&#39;re meditating or discussing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">those for</p>

<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">indeed</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">you will in code that&#39;s called encoding</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">specificity</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.840" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">what that means is your brain stores not</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">only what you&#39;re trying to do but all</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">of the implicit context around it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">you will teach your brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">uh that mindfulness always comes with</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">japanese music</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">and then it will be hard to transfer</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">to your daily life this is a clear</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">instance of the principle of where we</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">can do things to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">the practice more intense in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">set but it actually undermines</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">the general project of affording</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">a very adapted transfer to as much of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">our life as possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">and so this is an indication of how we</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">can be turning our</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">our set into something more a vacation</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">of a vacation and not enough of an</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">mark asked is it helpful to speak the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">five promises out loud yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">it is i just do them silently because i</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be imposing other the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">but when you&#39;re by yourself uh saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">the five promises out loud</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">um is very conducive to uh getting that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">intent</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">uh more deeply permeating through your</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">and also um it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">something that we&#39;re this is a general</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">principle we&#39;re striving towards and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">um i&#39;ll talk about this a lot um</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">especially when you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">neoplatonic part of the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">vibration</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">this is the idea of invocation</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">there&#39;s some things we just instantiate</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">what that means that&#39;s a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">term sorry</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">what that means is there are properties</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">and processes uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">we we actually embody like for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:05.679" style="s2">unquestionably</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:06.640" style="s2">i am body digestion but i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.679" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">embodying</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.640" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">you know the unfolding of being in space</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">and time so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">the the number of things</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">aspects of reality that we embody not</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">think about um is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">significant this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">a an idea about it&#39;s a way to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">idea of sort of microcosm within</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">reflects important aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">microcosm without</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">so we instantiate</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">a whole bunch of properties but we also</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.480" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">represent a lot of our properties</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">especially with language</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">and what we want to do is we want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">sort of like almost like stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">vision we want to move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">representing and just unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">instantiating</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">into what is what we&#39;re invoking</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">we&#39;re invoking a process so when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">speak aloud</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">you&#39;re not just representing your intent</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">you&#39;re also instantiating it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like when you say i promise you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">not just representing your promise</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">you&#39;re actually making a promise you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">both representing and instantiating</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">and then you&#39;re reaching beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:18.960" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to invoke aspirationally</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">like the very phenomena that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.960" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">are speaking and i know</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">some of you think this sounds creepily</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">like magic and we won&#39;t we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">get involved with magic</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">but notice how when again you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">a promise you&#39;re not only representing</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">you&#39;re actually instantiating it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">you&#39;re aspiring you&#39;re committing</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">uh to it into the future so speaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">aloud is a powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">to turn the promises into</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">invocations and implication is important</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">uh another question from our odd uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">jonas good to see your ad</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">again when i&#39;m deep into the process i</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">it it depends what you mean by enhancing</p>

<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">you want to eventually make this less</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">and less focal and explicit</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">so that it becomes more and more about</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">a constant reminder that</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to share</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">it helps all of us observation my breath</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">seems to be getting increasingly subtle</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">as my concentration deepens that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">very widely reported and normal part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">the practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">and it seems at the same time that</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">deepens my concentration</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">exactly so what&#39;s probably happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">because remember one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">trying to co-activate and remember that</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to keep coming back to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">idea too</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to co-activate both the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">and the parasympathetic so we want sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">a high degree of activity</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">in one sense but we&#39;re also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">move into this deep rootedness</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">and the subtle breath is really really</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">powerful uh for really getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">uh the profundity um from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">parasympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">um activation how it can really</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">help to calm and open like open up that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">uh so yes very much pleasure of doubt uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">brett</p>

<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">um can you elaborate in deeper past and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">what it means to meditate on the space</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">between the thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">should we still be focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">breath just on the brightness when</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">you&#39;re in deep vipassana</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">you move out of the breath as an</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.799" style="s2">explicit focus</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:17.760" style="s2">try to keep it like almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.799" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">of awareness it comes into</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">the mental as that sense like i said</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">that dynamic ground the energetic sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">so don&#39;t leave the body behind but</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not your focal awareness and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">coming into your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">insofar as you feel your awareness being</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">energized</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">a dynamic ground but that focal</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">is on the blankness the stillness the</p>

<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">aspects of your consciousness so that&#39;s</p>
