<p begin="00:00:03.290" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">but here&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna try to do I</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.029" end="00:00:11.450" style="s2">think I&#39;m gonna go do question and</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.620" end="00:00:13.410" style="s2">answers over at Eric our Weinstein on</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.450" end="00:00:15.870" style="s2">Instagram and I&#39;m just going to do a</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.410" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">sort of a short video here so that if</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.870" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">you guys want to join it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:22.740" style="s2">absolute pleasure to walk with you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:25.050" style="s2">take questions and have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">which I like doing often better than</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.050" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">monologues but I just wanted to say a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">couple of things which are on my mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:36.930" style="s2">which have to do in part with a very odd</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:42.210" style="s2">tweet that I saw today and the very odd</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.930" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">tweet was from Matt Iglesias over at Vox</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.210" end="00:00:48.170" style="s2">media and it had to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">that he was taking responsibility oddly</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.170" end="00:00:56.420" style="s2">for having screwed up the idea that woke</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">nizam or serious problem when taken very</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.420" end="00:01:02.219" style="s2">into very extreme lengths and that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:07.320" style="s2">problem was not confined as he had</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.219" end="00:01:10.020" style="s2">thought to college campuses so the you</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.320" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">know the old idea was hey it&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.020" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">of kids with green hair and you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">getting incredibly bent out of shape</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:21.710" style="s2">about it right however what was really</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">going on is is that college campuses and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.710" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">academics have a delayed effect in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:28.369" style="s2">a lot of these ideas like</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">intersectionality came out of UCLA</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.369" end="00:01:33.540" style="s2">unexamined privilege came out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">Wellesley many of these things started</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.540" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">in like either the late 70s 80s or early</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">90s so a lot of what we talk about today</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">is actually from academics and academic</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:48.049" style="s2">it takes a while for the stuff to to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">percolate now I don&#39;t actually even</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.049" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">believe that most of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">right now is peculiar to policing to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:02:01.460" style="s2">United States to race relations those</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">all play into it but I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.460" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">in fact like if you had headed somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">dying in immigration custody we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">have everyone in the streets over</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">immigration</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">rather than everyone in the streets over</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:19.409" style="s2">police</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">tality or racism so mad Iglesias was</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.409" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">sort of opining that things had gotten</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:27.000" style="s2">really out of control and he was going</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">to have to take responsibility that he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.000" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">actually gotten the stuff wrong well</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">somebody&#39;s reading boiling point in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">sense what I was saying is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:37.530" style="s2">supersaturated environment and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:39.269" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take much to create a phase</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.530" end="00:02:41.489" style="s2">transition you just need a nucleating</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.269" end="00:02:43.109" style="s2">event and so we got a nucleating event</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.489" end="00:02:44.969" style="s2">and now we&#39;re endlessly discussing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.109" end="00:02:47.790" style="s2">nucleating event rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.969" end="00:02:50.609" style="s2">supersaturated environment which has to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.790" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">do with the fact that I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.609" end="00:02:54.629" style="s2">people in our sense-making apparatus and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:56.909" style="s2">the media and political parties and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.629" end="00:03:00.540" style="s2">academics are either brave they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.909" end="00:03:02.549" style="s2">both brave and smart they&#39;re if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.540" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">one they&#39;re not the other and very often</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.549" end="00:03:07.669" style="s2">they&#39;re neither so what does this have</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:11.579" style="s2">to do with shame shame was in the title</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.669" end="00:03:13.049" style="s2">well I want to launch a thought with you</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.579" end="00:03:15.959" style="s2">guys and I&#39;ll develop maybe on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.049" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">podcast which is are we in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.959" end="00:03:22.079" style="s2">a worldwide shame fetish is there</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:25.909" style="s2">something about our phones that have</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.079" end="00:03:31.319" style="s2">actually activated our bizarre sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.909" end="00:03:35.720" style="s2">fetishistic thought processes so that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.319" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">are taking part in some incredibly weird</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.720" end="00:03:40.049" style="s2">game and I was thinking about narcissus</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:42.470" style="s2">and Ecco</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.049" end="00:03:44.759" style="s2">I guess avid was the one who sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.470" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">augmented the narcissus myth to include</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.759" end="00:03:52.259" style="s2">Ecco who falls in love with the beloved</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:55.139" style="s2">but the beloved notice is only the self</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.259" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">and I was thinking about looking at some</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.139" end="00:04:04.409" style="s2">videos of people in one case kissing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">shoes of a very bizarre group of black</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.409" end="00:04:09.030" style="s2">men who were demanding that white people</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:11.370" style="s2">kissed their shoes and another one where</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.030" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">somebody has told that somebody&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.370" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">black lives matter I don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">were was probably in a posture but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">know would you kneel please and I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">thinking about all the bizarre things</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.870" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">that have to do with knees at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">like okay Game of Thrones as my friend</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:29.210" style="s2">Douglas Murray points out put the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:31.949" style="s2">concept of bend the knee into the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.210" end="00:04:35.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a concept of Colin Kaepernick</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.949" end="00:04:38.729" style="s2">taking the knee there&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.790" end="00:04:40.440" style="s2">sexual connotation to knees you you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.729" end="00:04:42.630" style="s2">kneel before the Queen when you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.440" end="00:04:46.770" style="s2">knighted you may kneel together in</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.630" end="00:04:50.040" style="s2">common prayer you kneel when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.770" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">alone and asking something from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.040" end="00:04:56.010" style="s2">Creator and somehow I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:59.250" style="s2">incredibly weird and I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.010" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">incredibly disturbing and so what I keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.250" end="00:05:04.470" style="s2">wanting to ask is are we looking for</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:07.470" style="s2">equality I have always thought that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.470" end="00:05:09.620" style="s2">racial equality sexual equality various</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.470" end="00:05:11.550" style="s2">kinds of equality were really important</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.620" end="00:05:14.820" style="s2">either we are looking for it or we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.550" end="00:05:16.860" style="s2">aren&#39;t if we are looking for it I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.820" end="00:05:20.760" style="s2">me to say the following</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.860" end="00:05:25.620" style="s2">I may get on my knees with you if we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.760" end="00:05:27.720" style="s2">both moved in a moment but if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.620" end="00:05:30.990" style="s2">ever for me to get on my knees before</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.720" end="00:05:33.450" style="s2">you you&#39;ve just killed all hope of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.990" end="00:05:37.229" style="s2">equality and I was thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.450" end="00:05:42.300" style="s2">idea of what I as a Jewish person ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.229" end="00:05:44.789" style="s2">want a German person to kneel before me</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.300" end="00:05:46.650" style="s2">and kiss my shoes and the thought is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.789" end="00:05:51.240" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t even come up in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.650" end="00:05:54.750" style="s2">it makes me sick to my stomach this</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.240" end="00:05:58.650" style="s2">concept of a lie ship and whiteness and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.750" end="00:06:01.260" style="s2">anti blackness is a mind trap it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.650" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">really dangerous idea and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.260" end="00:06:05.610" style="s2">destroy the project that so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:08.760" style="s2">have been working on for forever which</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.610" end="00:06:11.580" style="s2">is how do we get a decent country in</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.760" end="00:06:15.090" style="s2">which the color of one&#39;s skin is no bar</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.580" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">and that we can be positive about who we</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.090" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">are and I think that what&#39;s going on is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.780" style="s2">is that we are in a worldwide shame</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:24.510" style="s2">fetish you know we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.780" end="00:06:26.699" style="s2">shaming and fat shaming and every kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.510" end="00:06:29.969" style="s2">of possible shame imaginable is trading</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.699" end="00:06:32.130" style="s2">at a premium and dignity is trading at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.969" end="00:06:33.419" style="s2">deep discount so I want to leave you</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.130" end="00:06:34.740" style="s2">guys with thought and then I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.419" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">follow me over to Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.740" end="00:06:38.940" style="s2">maybe we can talk about it which would</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:43.110" style="s2">be great where I&#39;m Eric our Weinstein at</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.940" end="00:06:45.660" style="s2">Instagram but are we in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.110" end="00:06:48.330" style="s2">something where some of us feel so</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.660" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">guilty that we&#39;re really kind of weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:53.729" style="s2">getting off on humbling ourselves before</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:56.580" style="s2">other people who feel so oppressed that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.729" end="00:06:58.470" style="s2">they want to oppress others and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.580" end="00:07:00.419" style="s2">think this is the modal situation I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.470" end="00:07:03.900" style="s2">don&#39;t think the average person in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.419" end="00:07:05.580" style="s2">street is looking for this but I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.900" end="00:07:08.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a ton of this and we saw this at</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.380" end="00:07:44.460" style="s2">tremendous responsibility for people who</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.449" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">somebody else suffers from I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.159" end="00:08:14.250" style="s2">that&#39;s entirely reasonable the instant</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.099" end="00:08:35.070" style="s2">instill in yourself some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:36.630" style="s2">revulsion because that&#39;s going to undo</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.070" end="00:08:38.760" style="s2">the project that we&#39;ve all been a part</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.630" end="00:08:41.310" style="s2">of and quite frankly the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.760" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">looking for this either because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.310" end="00:08:46.050" style="s2">dying to get down on their knees or</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:47.080" style="s2">because they demand that somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.050" end="00:08:49.270" style="s2">get down on their knees</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.080" end="00:08:50.500" style="s2">or the idea is that some people have it</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.270" end="00:08:52.810" style="s2">coming because they look like other</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.500" end="00:08:54.730" style="s2">people who are horrible these people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.810" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">going to undo a national project and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:08:58.570" style="s2">this is a long project for which many</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:00.280" style="s2">people have suffered many people have</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.570" end="00:09:01.960" style="s2">worked and many people have died and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.280" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">quite frankly it&#39;s not up to them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.960" end="00:09:07.330" style="s2">undo it because it belongs to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:09.880" style="s2">and so my feeling about this is a modest</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.330" end="00:09:12.280" style="s2">amount of responsibility is worth a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.880" end="00:09:14.140" style="s2">great deal more than an oppressive mount</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.280" end="00:09:18.970" style="s2">amount and a self-extinguishing amount</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.140" end="00:09:20.770" style="s2">of of performative guilt meant to convey</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.970" end="00:09:23.050" style="s2">that you&#39;re willing to destroy your own</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.770" end="00:09:24.460" style="s2">dignity at the drop of a hat because you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.050" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">do understand that other people have had</p>
