<p begin="00:00:00.979" end="00:00:09.510" style="s2">hello Internet I have been shinned</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.830" end="00:00:12.269" style="s2">before probably but my university degree</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.510" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">is in ecology so I very much look at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:20.340" style="s2">world as an ecological system there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">this idea that people say that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.340" end="00:00:22.619" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.910" end="00:00:25.050" style="s2">that&#39;s like humans are the most evolved</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.619" end="00:00:27.180" style="s2">species and that&#39;s not true at all</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.050" end="00:00:29.220" style="s2">because there are no more evolved</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.180" end="00:00:31.349" style="s2">species than another if you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.220" end="00:00:33.149" style="s2">evolution which if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.349" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">they evolved then we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">evolution all came from the same single</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">cells</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">so therefore bacteria are just as</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">evolved as humans and this lighting is</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">really gonna get to me but I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">stay still in the Sun so and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.020" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">at like humans are we&#39;ve amassed culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">and cities and done amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:58.710" style="s2">technological advances but we still at</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">the same time lock a human in the in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.710" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">room with a tiger my money&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">tiger if you have humanity against the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:05.780" style="s2">Ebola virus although humanity might not</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">be wiped out by the Ebola virus</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.780" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">individuals are we aren&#39;t more evolved</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">than any other species</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:13.799" style="s2">we just happen to have certain</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">characteristics that other species don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.799" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">have when you look at an ecosystem it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">takes diversity you need to have both</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.860" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">carnivores and herbivores and d&#39;Ãªtre</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">wars you need to have nocturnal and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">diurnal species if I said that right we</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">need to have species that breed really</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">fast and get eaten and ones that breed</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:36.780" style="s2">really slowly and eat others like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">part of how we have an ecosystem but</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.780" end="00:01:41.700" style="s2">then when we look at our economics which</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.890" style="s2">by the way is very tied to ecology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">very much based on ecology a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.890" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">same formulas go into it except that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">ecology is an actual science that we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">see and study and discover and economics</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">is like theory that we&#39;ve put into</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:01:58.939" style="s2">practice and then I don&#39;t know like we</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:04.380" style="s2">force it to be what we we think it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.939" end="00:02:07.429" style="s2">but looking at our species singularly</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.380" end="00:02:08.679" style="s2">just humans I think there&#39;s a parallel</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.429" end="00:02:10.569" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.679" end="00:02:13.810" style="s2">we aren&#39;t all supposed to be Tigers</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.569" end="00:02:15.400" style="s2">we&#39;re not all supposed to be this top of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.810" end="00:02:16.599" style="s2">the food chain like there&#39;s a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.400" end="00:02:18.310" style="s2">because there is no top of the food</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.599" end="00:02:20.250" style="s2">chain the tiger dies and gets eaten by</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.310" end="00:02:25.269" style="s2">the bacteria same as everyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.250" end="00:02:27.609" style="s2">so we don&#39;t look at a cat and compare it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.269" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">to a dog and be like oh that cats lazy</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.609" end="00:02:32.439" style="s2">it&#39;s like no the cats doing its own</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:34.659" style="s2">thing the cat needs to lay around for 4</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.439" end="00:02:36.790" style="s2">hours a day to get enough energy to hunt</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.659" end="00:02:42.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s including Lions in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.790" end="00:02:43.799" style="s2">Sahara that having the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.040" end="00:02:47.799" style="s2">humanity is how we&#39;re going to save us</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.799" end="00:02:49.420" style="s2">having allowing people who are like cats</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.799" end="00:02:50.920" style="s2">to be like cats people that are like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.420" end="00:02:53.590" style="s2">dogs to be like dog sounds about right</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.920" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">carnivores people who are bumblebee is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.590" end="00:02:57.430" style="s2">to be bumblebees like we need the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:02:59.439" style="s2">diversity in humanity we need neuro</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.430" end="00:03:01.019" style="s2">diversity we need physical diversity we</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.439" end="00:03:03.340" style="s2">need diversity of experience and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.019" end="00:03:06.310" style="s2">interests in order to save the planet</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.340" end="00:03:09.939" style="s2">because but we are all sitting in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.310" end="00:03:12.310" style="s2">own little species in this like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.939" end="00:03:15.220" style="s2">cat I&#39;ve become a cat because of my like</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.310" end="00:03:20.949" style="s2">I spend a lot of my day sleeping and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.220" end="00:03:23.410" style="s2">also eat meat there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.949" end="00:03:24.790" style="s2">a cat sleeping all the time why is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.410" end="00:03:26.199" style="s2">wrong for us well because your sister</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.790" end="00:03:27.790" style="s2">work 40 hours a week you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.199" end="00:03:29.650" style="s2">write but that&#39;s based on an average</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.790" end="00:03:32.739" style="s2">that&#39;s based on the average of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.650" end="00:03:34.810" style="s2">humanity is capable of not based on</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.739" end="00:03:36.099" style="s2">either side of the spectrum there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.810" end="00:03:37.510" style="s2">people who 40 hours a week is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.099" end="00:03:39.400" style="s2">and they only need to sleep four hours a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.510" end="00:03:40.629" style="s2">day they have unlimited energy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.400" end="00:03:43.060" style="s2">they&#39;re like I can just go go go 80</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.629" end="00:03:45.609" style="s2">hours a day maybe out 80 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.060" end="00:03:49.030" style="s2">then there&#39;s people who like me who like</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.609" end="00:03:50.919" style="s2">even 5-10 hours is too much and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.030" end="00:03:53.109" style="s2">all along the spectrum that&#39;s every</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.919" end="00:03:58.629" style="s2">spectrum exists and instead of elevating</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.109" end="00:04:00.549" style="s2">one side we need to honor that we exist</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.629" end="00:04:02.409" style="s2">along a spectrum and not just that like</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.549" end="00:04:03.579" style="s2">oh but then those lazy people right but</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.409" end="00:04:04.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something that comes from it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.579" end="00:04:06.609" style="s2">like there&#39;s something that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.900" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">cats being like that that they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.609" end="00:04:11.620" style="s2">to hunt that they&#39;re able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">side of things and having all this Todd</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.620" end="00:04:16.180" style="s2">downtime that I wouldn&#39;t have chosen to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.739" style="s2">have it&#39;s not it&#39;s means more of my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.180" end="00:04:19.299" style="s2">is spent sleeping and resting and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.739" end="00:04:22.580" style="s2">not able to do things which is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.299" end="00:04:23.599" style="s2">society values but I also know that like</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:26.090" style="s2">that&#39;s where my thoughts come from</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.599" end="00:04:29.689" style="s2">that&#39;s where the ability to create comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.090" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">from is that downtime is that the beam</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.689" end="00:04:35.090" style="s2">force that I can&#39;t physically do it I</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">have to grow I have to get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.090" end="00:04:40.789" style="s2">where I can recruit other people to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:43.189" style="s2">it and if I don&#39;t get to that point then</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.789" end="00:04:44.750" style="s2">it&#39;s never gonna happen but to and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.189" end="00:04:46.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m not doing this this topic</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.750" end="00:04:48.500" style="s2">justice and it doesn&#39;t always be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.580" end="00:04:51.379" style="s2">little bit because I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.500" end="00:04:53.030" style="s2">convey like species in nature are all</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.379" end="00:04:54.439" style="s2">important to come together and work to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.030" end="00:04:58.520" style="s2">have an ecosystem that runs all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.439" end="00:05:00.680" style="s2">humanity disappeared the biosphere would</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.520" end="00:05:01.940" style="s2">thrive if the bees all disappeared if</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.680" end="00:05:06.889" style="s2">the ants all disappeared if the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:08.750" style="s2">earthworms all disappeared the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.889" end="00:05:11.629" style="s2">would probably most likely collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.750" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">so just because we are more intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.629" end="00:05:15.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re more important and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.029" style="s2">similarly in our species just because</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.650" end="00:05:18.830" style="s2">someone has a particular form of</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.830" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">something that makes them more elevated</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.949" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">in our society&#39;s culture our cultural in</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">mean they&#39;re actually more important</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:33.169" style="s2">that&#39;s just our current view of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:36.199" style="s2">every single human being on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.169" end="00:05:38.389" style="s2">is needed in exactly who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.199" end="00:05:42.830" style="s2">what they are and that coming together</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.389" end="00:05:45.729" style="s2">is how we save our species all of us</p>
