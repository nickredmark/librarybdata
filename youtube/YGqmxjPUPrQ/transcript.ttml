<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">always kind of in the back of my mind</p>

<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">while and I had this idea in the back of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">my head of having conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">people who you know who I find it you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:41.700" style="s2">know intriguing in some kind of way and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">also who are not necessarily known to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">other people you know because you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">in the in this sort of media landscape</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:55.350" style="s2">you know a lot of people who have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">kind of something to say a fall through</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.350" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">the cracks right and let&#39;s say I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">this contact with them on Facebook and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">find it very interesting and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">there&#39;s this limitation of it being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">text conversation and and then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">wanting to take that to the next level</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">and have you know actual conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">yeah that all makes sense to me I in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">relationships that begin in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">electronic context I&#39;m very skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:40.069" style="s2">about conducting any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">relationship in text and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.069" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">whenever someone reaches out to me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">they want to have any kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:51.330" style="s2">conversation at all it&#39;s pretty common</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:54.090" style="s2">that all take a moment and just explain</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.330" end="00:02:56.819" style="s2">to them even though in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.090" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">context this may be a little confusing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.819" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">for some people</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:03.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t conduct conversations in text</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:06.569" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.170" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll occasionally make a rare</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.569" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">exception in the case of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:15.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have you know the technology to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:17.070" style="s2">do something else or maybe they live in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.480" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">a place where we can&#39;t easily have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.070" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">phone conversation but almost invariably</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:25.859" style="s2">I&#39;ll just say hey I love to talk with</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">you let&#39;s arrange a time when we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.859" end="00:03:32.209" style="s2">hear each other&#39;s voices or perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">better see each other&#39;s faces and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.209" end="00:03:38.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of reasons for that some</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">of them having to do with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.900" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">although there really aren&#39;t any methods</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.709" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">other than meeting in person that give</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:56.389" style="s2">us privacy back I&#39;m not happy about</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">having third parties in on conversations</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.389" end="00:04:04.980" style="s2">not happy about the knowledge that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:08.819" style="s2">we&#39;re saying is probably being recorded</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.980" end="00:04:13.470" style="s2">or analyzed for producing analytics for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.819" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">corporations I would never invite a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.470" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">corporate representative to an intimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:21.030" style="s2">conversation with somebody who I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.890" style="s2">talk there are no circumstances under</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.030" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">which I wouldn&#39;t even consider such as</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.890" end="00:04:28.289" style="s2">that and yet this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">pretty much what&#39;s happening to all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.289" end="00:04:34.139" style="s2">us all day every day even in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:38.460" style="s2">telephone conversations even in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.139" end="00:04:41.219" style="s2">conversation so then of course if it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.460" end="00:04:43.319" style="s2">happens to varying degrees I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.219" end="00:04:45.539" style="s2">particularly paranoid about it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.319" end="00:04:51.830" style="s2">simply aware of it and I I disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.539" end="00:04:58.310" style="s2">it I don&#39;t like it I I want to establish</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.830" end="00:05:00.300" style="s2">ways that that no longer happens or if</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.310" end="00:05:02.990" style="s2">we&#39;re just living in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:05.460" style="s2">that&#39;s now going to happen all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.990" end="00:05:08.909" style="s2">then I think it&#39;s very important that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.460" end="00:05:12.569" style="s2">establish a system that delivers the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.909" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">analytics to us and only us and then if</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.569" end="00:05:18.330" style="s2">other people want any access to those</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:20.449" style="s2">analytics we can limit that access and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.330" end="00:05:23.129" style="s2">they have to buy it from us essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.449" end="00:05:25.289" style="s2">so one of the things that concerns me</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.129" end="00:05:28.500" style="s2">without going into too much detail about</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.289" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">this is just that we&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.500" end="00:05:34.529" style="s2">pyramids of data for corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:36.979" style="s2">the new money in in our time is analytic</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.529" end="00:05:39.750" style="s2">data about individuals and social groups</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.979" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">and for anybody other than us to be in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.750" end="00:05:45.389" style="s2">possession of that data is fatally</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:47.190" style="s2">dangerous it&#39;s it&#39;s terrifyingly</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.389" end="00:05:48.990" style="s2">dangerous and for people who know</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.190" end="00:05:53.190" style="s2">anything about history and the history</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.990" end="00:05:56.099" style="s2">of like how very similar things have</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.190" end="00:05:59.879" style="s2">been used and passed when there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.099" end="00:06:04.349" style="s2">regime changes or things like this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.879" end="00:06:07.139" style="s2">really startling I&#39;ve had people explain</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.349" end="00:06:09.539" style="s2">to me things that happened with a system</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.139" end="00:06:13.289" style="s2">that was given to Iran in the 1980s by</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.539" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">IBM and when the Shah was ousted and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.289" end="00:06:19.169" style="s2">Ayatollah took over they basically went</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:22.469" style="s2">through that system and this was minimal</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.169" end="00:06:26.159" style="s2">analytic data it&#39;s nothing like what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.469" end="00:06:27.419" style="s2">created or in possession of today anyway</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.159" end="00:06:29.430" style="s2">the new regime went through that system</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.419" end="00:06:32.430" style="s2">invited all the activists and scholars</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.430" end="00:06:37.650" style="s2">and and people who had left the country</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.430" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">back telling them that they you know be</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.650" end="00:06:43.920" style="s2">forgiving for any previous wrongdoings</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">and you know he wants you back in Iran</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.920" end="00:06:49.020" style="s2">and when those people came back on</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:51.240" style="s2">airplanes and my friend&#39;s family was</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.020" end="00:06:53.070" style="s2">among those people they simply executed</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.240" end="00:06:57.270" style="s2">them on the tarmac when they landed just</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.070" end="00:07:00.780" style="s2">straight-up Shakman head right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.270" end="00:07:03.750" style="s2">a telling example of what can happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.780" end="00:07:05.190" style="s2">with an intelligent system and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.750" end="00:07:08.370" style="s2">intelligence systems that we&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.190" end="00:07:14.550" style="s2">are so sophisticated now that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.370" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">easily create the of the reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.550" end="00:07:19.170" style="s2">future possibility of directly</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:21.390" style="s2">manipulating our minds directly</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.170" end="00:07:22.950" style="s2">manipulating our felt sense of being in</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.390" end="00:07:25.610" style="s2">the world our consciousness what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.950" end="00:07:28.230" style="s2">think about what we pay attention to and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.610" end="00:07:31.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t think anybody realizes just how</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.230" end="00:07:34.590" style="s2">vulnerable we are to this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.640" end="00:07:38.010" style="s2">influence most of us well one example I</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.590" end="00:07:41.070" style="s2">heard was recently you know ads being</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.010" end="00:07:43.860" style="s2">sent to two women who don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.070" end="00:07:45.960" style="s2">they&#39;re pregnant yet you know and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.860" end="00:07:48.270" style="s2">means that the Internet is developing</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.960" end="00:07:50.460" style="s2">this kind of subconscious collective</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.270" end="00:07:52.830" style="s2">subconscious right who&#39;s that&#39;s aware of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.460" end="00:07:56.940" style="s2">things before you are before your</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.830" end="00:08:00.360" style="s2">conscious mind yes yeah there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.940" end="00:08:04.290" style="s2">kinds of astonishing things that could</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:07.080" style="s2">be done with for each other if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.290" end="00:08:08.700" style="s2">established a system where we use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.080" end="00:08:11.730" style="s2">analytics that are produced by our</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.700" end="00:08:16.380" style="s2">interactions with devices to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.730" end="00:08:20.910" style="s2">to grow and to respond to issues or</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.380" end="00:08:23.550" style="s2">threats together okay well maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.910" end="00:08:28.110" style="s2">could talk about that result yes sorry</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.550" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">to interrupt I find that these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.110" end="00:08:33.920" style="s2">discussions uh you know we&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:37.350" style="s2">the totalitarian you know potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.920" end="00:08:40.170" style="s2">listen that&#39;s often discussed right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.350" end="00:08:44.280" style="s2">but your one thing I&#39;ve noticed about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.170" end="00:08:46.200" style="s2">your posts is that your are the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.280" end="00:08:48.960" style="s2">you write about is that you you very</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.200" end="00:08:51.420" style="s2">much make us aware of potential you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.960" end="00:08:54.870" style="s2">hoarders you know of our world and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.420" end="00:08:57.000" style="s2">to each other but also you you also seem</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.870" end="00:08:59.430" style="s2">to have a utopian sort of view you seem</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.000" end="00:09:03.320" style="s2">to have a few that you know we can we</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.430" end="00:09:05.850" style="s2">can you know we can we can harness this</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">technology for you know the good the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.850" end="00:09:13.350" style="s2">true and the beautiful or whatever so so</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:14.670" style="s2">it so instead of this being just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">conversation where we complain about</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.670" end="00:09:20.579" style="s2">corporations and capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">dehumanization what what do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.579" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">can we can do in this online world you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:27.660" style="s2">know because you know I I I understand a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:30.089" style="s2">lot of the criticisms you have and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.660" end="00:09:34.019" style="s2">think a bit more on a personal level</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.089" end="00:09:35.790" style="s2">like I see sort of Facebook as wrecking</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.019" end="00:09:39.180" style="s2">people&#39;s relationships with each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.790" end="00:09:41.250" style="s2">often and and creating very strange</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.180" end="00:09:44.579" style="s2">artificial relationships with people and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.250" end="00:09:47.550" style="s2">the damage that that does and the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.579" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">kind of collective you know addiction</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.550" end="00:09:57.000" style="s2">that we all have so at the same time you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:59.459" style="s2">know I also seem to be working in your</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.000" end="00:10:01.560" style="s2">mind towards solutions to these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.459" end="00:10:03.750" style="s2">problems like you&#39;re you&#39;re a person</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.560" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">who&#39;s you describe yourself I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.750" end="00:10:09.480" style="s2">a detective at one point and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:11.459" style="s2">who&#39;s you know looking for solution so</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.480" end="00:10:18.540" style="s2">what can you do what what get what can</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.459" end="00:10:22.050" style="s2">we do what you know so first of all I do</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.540" end="00:10:25.699" style="s2">think I have a very unusual perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.050" end="00:10:33.329" style="s2">on how we how our minds relate with</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.699" end="00:10:36.120" style="s2">language and concepts and models and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.329" end="00:10:40.410" style="s2">I have a variety of very intense</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.120" end="00:10:43.019" style="s2">interests I&#39;m interested in mind how we</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.410" end="00:10:45.329" style="s2">form Minds how that happens together</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.019" end="00:10:49.529" style="s2">what happens if we do it differently</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.329" end="00:10:53.069" style="s2">what happens if there&#39;s intervening</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.529" end="00:10:54.930" style="s2">agencies involved because of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.069" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">we&#39;re aware of this whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.930" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">conscious or not I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:04.710" style="s2">dreaming very deeply I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">hypnosis and how people are influenced</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.710" end="00:11:08.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved with computing</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:12.060" style="s2">technologies pretty much since they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.850" end="00:11:15.029" style="s2">invented as a technician I&#39;ve seen how</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.060" end="00:11:18.089" style="s2">email changes changed our relationships</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.029" end="00:11:20.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen how the onset of first cell</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.089" end="00:11:22.680" style="s2">phones and then smartphones have changed</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.190" end="00:11:26.270" style="s2">our relationships and I opted out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.680" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">cell phone and smartphone sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.270" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">transformation because I wanted to watch</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:34.950" style="s2">it from outside and I&#39;ve only within the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:40.080" style="s2">past six months for the first time had a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.950" end="00:11:45.180" style="s2">mobile phone of any kind I&#39;m absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.080" end="00:11:49.890" style="s2">fascinated and in in love with living</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.180" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">things I deeply observe insects and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.890" end="00:11:54.360" style="s2">animals and plants and I relate with</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:57.180" style="s2">them very intimately</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">you mentioned can I just interject here</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.180" end="00:12:02.370" style="s2">you mentioned insects and and I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:04.589" style="s2">heard you you know I&#39;ve you&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.370" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">about insects and I find that I find</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.589" end="00:12:09.630" style="s2">that very fascinating what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:12.660" style="s2">your connection to to insects so first</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.630" end="00:12:15.000" style="s2">of all it&#39;s just a natural thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.660" end="00:12:20.940" style="s2">the way that I&#39;ve been since I was born</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.000" end="00:12:25.470" style="s2">this way I absolutely adore living</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.940" end="00:12:27.900" style="s2">things and for me those represent they</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.470" end="00:12:31.470" style="s2">don&#39;t represent those are the body of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.900" end="00:12:33.480" style="s2">the real they&#39;re not representations I</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.470" end="00:12:36.420" style="s2">mean they can be understood in various</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.480" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">ways but and and so since I&#39;ve been at</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.420" end="00:12:41.700" style="s2">since I was a child I&#39;ve just had an</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:44.430" style="s2">incredible affinity for living things</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.700" end="00:12:48.329" style="s2">and it&#39;s a shared affinity so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.430" end="00:12:50.220" style="s2">you know hundreds of stories of what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.329" end="00:12:54.570" style="s2">think most people would consider to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.220" end="00:12:57.180" style="s2">very unusual events but I&#39;m a person who</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.570" end="00:12:59.220" style="s2">for example has the experience and by</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.180" end="00:13:04.230" style="s2">the way there are many such people I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.220" end="00:13:06.899" style="s2">met others like me who can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.230" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">directly with an insect something that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.899" end="00:13:13.320" style="s2">think most people would consider to be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:15.900" style="s2">ridiculous idea and I can for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.320" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">talk an insect on in my hand carry it</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.900" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">around with me</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:22.310" style="s2">if there&#39;s a fly buzzing around my</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:24.980" style="s2">window I can get the fly on my hand and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.310" end="00:13:27.560" style="s2">just carried it out the back door if</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.980" end="00:13:29.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a moth or a wasp or any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.560" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">little creature and of course every</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.810" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">every events unique and I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">to claim as I have any special</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:40.510" style="s2">supernatural power or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:42.380" style="s2">I think rather that we&#39;ve as moderns</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.510" end="00:13:44.600" style="s2">because of the context we&#39;re usually</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.380" end="00:13:46.070" style="s2">involved in and what we&#39;re taught to how</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.600" end="00:13:46.519" style="s2">we&#39;re taught to see life and think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.070" end="00:13:50.980" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.519" end="00:13:54.110" style="s2">we&#39;re just confused right we&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.980" end="00:13:56.089" style="s2">90% of the abilities and affinities that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.110" end="00:13:58.970" style="s2">are natural to to our humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.089" end="00:14:02.870" style="s2">recovering those is something that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.970" end="00:14:05.180" style="s2">very passionate about so I&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.870" end="00:14:08.149" style="s2">friend and observer of insects and tiny</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.180" end="00:14:11.329" style="s2">creatures since I was a child and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.149" end="00:14:13.790" style="s2">learned so much I continue to learn so</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.329" end="00:14:18.620" style="s2">much from from that relationship always</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.790" end="00:14:20.810" style="s2">I think there&#39;s something that I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.620" end="00:14:23.510" style="s2">to say briefly about my perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.810" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">life on Earth and what&#39;s kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.510" end="00:14:30.110" style="s2">on here and I&#39;ll return to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:32.390" style="s2">other questions in a moment so in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.110" end="00:14:37.100" style="s2">branches of human subculture there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.390" end="00:14:38.750" style="s2">fascination with aliens and and this you</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.100" end="00:14:41.209" style="s2">know is the idea that there are other</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.750" end="00:14:43.880" style="s2">intelligent life forms possibly either</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.209" end="00:14:46.730" style="s2">from other dimensions or from other</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:50.500" style="s2">planets in space that from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.730" end="00:14:53.959" style="s2">or maybe regularly visit earth and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.500" end="00:14:57.589" style="s2">that&#39;s a really complex topic some of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.959" end="00:14:58.850" style="s2">has to do with psychosis it&#39;s funny I</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.589" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">was thinking about that while you were</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.850" end="00:15:02.600" style="s2">when I when you mentioned insects I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:04.730" style="s2">bizarre I&#39;d already made that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.600" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">connection see the bat down I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.730" end="00:15:13.670" style="s2">here so the topic of extraterrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:14.750" style="s2">intelligence and it is one topic and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.670" end="00:15:17.029" style="s2">then there&#39;s there&#39;s this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.750" end="00:15:20.660" style="s2">related topic which is how that gets</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.029" end="00:15:23.810" style="s2">dealt with in human subcultures and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.660" end="00:15:25.520" style="s2">particularly media cultures and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.810" end="00:15:28.220" style="s2">there&#39;s some really fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.520" end="00:15:29.500" style="s2">useful and intelligent exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.220" end="00:15:32.740" style="s2">this idea and then there</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.500" end="00:15:36.820" style="s2">some really bizarre kind of psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.740" end="00:15:39.220" style="s2">paranoid examination of this topic and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.820" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a very sophisticated mess that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.220" end="00:15:41.730" style="s2">don&#39;t have to thankfully we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:43.930" style="s2">to tease that apart right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.730" end="00:15:47.140" style="s2">what I wanted to say is something</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.930" end="00:15:53.250" style="s2">relatively simple that I find both</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.140" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">shocking and and exciting which is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.250" end="00:16:00.970" style="s2">you know when people see organisms that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:04.600" style="s2">they consider to be exotic like octopi</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.970" end="00:16:09.150" style="s2">or preying mantises or wasps or or</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.600" end="00:16:12.580" style="s2">mantis shrimp for example new to Bronx</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.150" end="00:16:18.340" style="s2">you&#39;ll often hear them say oh it looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.580" end="00:16:22.360" style="s2">like an alien how they know what an</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.340" end="00:16:26.350" style="s2">alien looks like I mean what inclines</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.360" end="00:16:27.460" style="s2">them to suspect that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.350" end="00:16:31.150" style="s2">strange</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.460" end="00:16:34.600" style="s2">like why is their first move that must</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.150" end="00:16:35.950" style="s2">be like from another world right looks</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.600" end="00:16:36.520" style="s2">like a thing from a science fiction</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.950" end="00:16:39.339" style="s2">movie</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.520" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">well har the reason for that is simply</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.339" end="00:16:44.200" style="s2">that science fiction movies get their</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">inspiration like like we do for our</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.200" end="00:16:49.230" style="s2">devices and everything everything that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.660" end="00:16:52.150" style="s2">we get that we make something of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.230" end="00:16:53.470" style="s2">originates in nature right so science</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.150" end="00:16:59.110" style="s2">fiction movies has been have been</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.470" end="00:17:02.890" style="s2">stealing insects and exotic animals and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.110" end="00:17:05.770" style="s2">sort of transposing those onto their</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.890" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">presentations of aliens right so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.770" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">been kind of trained to think that way</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:14.140" style="s2">but well is it terror of terror of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:17.350" style="s2">uncanny and the unknown and and what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.140" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">farthest away from our let&#39;s say sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.350" end="00:17:21.130" style="s2">of ourselves sure that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">part of it um</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.130" end="00:17:31.660" style="s2">I think we&#39;ve basically unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:33.940" style="s2">many people have been trained to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.660" end="00:17:36.070" style="s2">xenophobic they&#39;re actually just afraid</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.940" end="00:17:37.540" style="s2">of living things in general living</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.070" end="00:17:40.600" style="s2">things aren&#39;t predictable</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.540" end="00:17:41.980" style="s2">they don&#39;t fit into our representational</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.600" end="00:17:44.230" style="s2">paradigms they don&#39;t listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.980" end="00:17:47.450" style="s2">language they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.230" end="00:17:49.670" style="s2">they&#39;re intimately involved in their</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.450" end="00:17:52.610" style="s2">experience of being alive rather than</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.670" end="00:17:55.100" style="s2">our desires or representations of how</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.610" end="00:17:57.020" style="s2">things should be or whatever so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.100" end="00:17:59.300" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of unpredictable and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.020" end="00:18:02.770" style="s2">makes them scary and they could hurt us</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.300" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">or well like my wife for example is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.770" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">absolutely petrified of spiders right</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">and III love them I could take them in</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:14.030" style="s2">my hand and I&#39;m the same way and I I</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:16.510" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t particularly understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.030" end="00:18:19.790" style="s2">that that fear because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.510" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">completely built into her nature in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.790" end="00:18:24.440" style="s2">way it&#39;s almost like I guess she could</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">she could probably overcome it through</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.440" end="00:18:28.760" style="s2">you know exposure to it you know she if</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:33.080" style="s2">she really wanted to but you know what</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.760" end="00:18:35.150" style="s2">Wyatt why why is that that kind of fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.080" end="00:18:37.220" style="s2">seems to be deeply built into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.150" end="00:18:40.010" style="s2">people a fear of the strange right or</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.220" end="00:18:41.630" style="s2">what they consider to be stranger or and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.010" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s partly fear of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.630" end="00:18:47.780" style="s2">that they are are the alien or you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">they&#39;re alien no just fears that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.780" end="00:18:58.760" style="s2">relatively natural I think for primates</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:19:01.310" style="s2">right and the three the three that stand</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.760" end="00:19:07.250" style="s2">out to my to my thought in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.310" end="00:19:10.820" style="s2">are spiders and insects wasps bite you</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.250" end="00:19:12.470" style="s2">hurt you they can be small you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.820" end="00:19:13.790" style="s2">find them you can&#39;t control them you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.470" end="00:19:15.470" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they&#39;re on but is there</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.790" end="00:19:17.960" style="s2">one on me or not right like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.470" end="00:19:19.910" style="s2">lot of kind of scary things that one</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.960" end="00:19:22.010" style="s2">could imagine about them the other is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.910" end="00:19:26.330" style="s2">snakes snakes has been a problem for</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.010" end="00:19:28.220" style="s2">primates from time immemorial and part</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.330" end="00:19:30.350" style="s2">of the reason that snakes our</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.220" end="00:19:32.270" style="s2">frightening is that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.350" end="00:19:35.810" style="s2">invisible in the environment until they</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.270" end="00:19:37.610" style="s2">strike you right so that&#39;s really and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.810" end="00:19:39.650" style="s2">this is the same thing spiders right you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.610" end="00:19:42.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know is there a spider on me right</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.650" end="00:19:47.090" style="s2">now you can&#39;t really be sure there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.730" end="00:19:52.550" style="s2">and then the third thing would be like</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.090" end="00:19:54.410" style="s2">large apex predators lions Jaguars used</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.550" end="00:19:56.310" style="s2">to eat human beings all the time in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.410" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">South America</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.310" end="00:20:01.410" style="s2">Panthers which actually there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:05.690" style="s2">thing as a panther that&#39;s sort of pet</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.410" end="00:20:11.180" style="s2">name for a class of animals lions tigers</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.690" end="00:20:15.180" style="s2">stuff like mice right or another one so</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.180" end="00:20:19.950" style="s2">for some stuff that might just be sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.180" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">of hereditary or hereditarily common for</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.950" end="00:20:27.390" style="s2">us humans to be afraid of and some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:29.670" style="s2">that has to do with something that may</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.390" end="00:20:32.490" style="s2">or may not be pretty natural to our</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.670" end="00:20:34.110" style="s2">animal form and then another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.490" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">though it has to do with how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.110" end="00:20:41.340" style="s2">enculturated so one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.460" end="00:20:45.570" style="s2">found very confusing as a child was and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.340" end="00:20:48.540" style="s2">actually very painful was just that most</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.570" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">of the other humans and adults saw small</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.540" end="00:20:55.500" style="s2">creatures as something to be destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:58.020" style="s2">often as a form of entertainment or you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.500" end="00:21:00.060" style="s2">know just if it moves kill it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.020" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.060" end="00:21:06.300" style="s2">xenophobia that a fear of living things</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:09.570" style="s2">Arab living things have an aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.300" end="00:21:12.690" style="s2">fear of living things that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.570" end="00:21:15.240" style="s2">commonly instanced in human persons and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.690" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">cultures but I want to get back to where</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.240" end="00:21:23.460" style="s2">I was going about insects and exotic</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:25.830" style="s2">creatures and aliens so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.460" end="00:21:28.140" style="s2">things that&#39;s just blatantly obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.830" end="00:21:29.700" style="s2">me and it&#39;s a little bit surprising that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.140" end="00:21:32.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not more obvious to other people</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.700" end="00:21:35.820" style="s2">however our alienation from living</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.820" end="00:21:39.350" style="s2">things and we have that if an individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.820" end="00:21:42.180" style="s2">is experiencing that gets sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.350" end="00:21:44.340" style="s2">reprojected right and the aliens from</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.180" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">the sky thing is part about projection</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.340" end="00:21:50.670" style="s2">in some cases yeah terrified of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:52.950" style="s2">alienated from living things and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.670" end="00:21:56.850" style="s2">creates this sort of pseudo projection</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.950" end="00:22:01.980" style="s2">of our alienation that then could</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.850" end="00:22:08.130" style="s2">produce for example some form of life or</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.980" end="00:22:09.199" style="s2">a being that was to us as we are to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.130" end="00:22:12.929" style="s2">living things</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.199" end="00:22:15.599" style="s2">yeah I can imagine this process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.929" end="00:22:20.069" style="s2">rejection happening but what I actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.599" end="00:22:21.869" style="s2">find intriguing and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.069" end="00:22:23.519" style="s2">mentioned like there&#39;s these two</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.869" end="00:22:26.429" style="s2">branches right there&#39;s what am i</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.519" end="00:22:31.709" style="s2">concerned about and and what can we what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.429" end="00:22:34.049" style="s2">are the positive things right so so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.709" end="00:22:36.389" style="s2">concerned about human xenophobia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.049" end="00:22:38.459" style="s2">wiping out you know the remaining</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.389" end="00:22:42.269" style="s2">conserved ecologies which was a single</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.459" end="00:22:43.799" style="s2">most precious thing in our living aspect</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.269" end="00:22:46.109" style="s2">as human beings these are the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.799" end="00:22:49.049" style="s2">precious thing the ecologies that remain</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.109" end="00:22:54.839" style="s2">in my in my view and I can get a new one</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.049" end="00:22:56.699" style="s2">primeval original Ecology&#39;s well just</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.839" end="00:22:59.009" style="s2">whatever has been be conserved right</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.699" end="00:23:06.029" style="s2">whatever we&#39;ve still got left is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.009" end="00:23:07.289" style="s2">how I think of it yeah so those like if</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.029" end="00:23:09.809" style="s2">you were to just point your finger out</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.289" end="00:23:11.339" style="s2">into space right in some directions</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.809" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">where the sky right and you just</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.339" end="00:23:16.619" style="s2">followed that line for who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:19.139" style="s2">50,000 light years a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.619" end="00:23:21.029" style="s2">light years be very very unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.139" end="00:23:24.419" style="s2">along that line you&#39;d come to this life</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.029" end="00:23:28.549" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible we don&#39;t know but a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.419" end="00:23:31.709" style="s2">world as paradise eclis fraught with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.549" end="00:23:33.659" style="s2">explosions of complex organism all</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.709" end="00:23:35.669" style="s2">sentience and transcendence and networks</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.659" end="00:23:37.559" style="s2">of life you&#39;re not going to find it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.669" end="00:23:39.509" style="s2">this whatever there might be out in</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.559" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">space the one thing we can be sure of is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.509" end="00:23:42.449" style="s2">that it&#39;s not friendly to life it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:45.539" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s none out there</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.449" end="00:23:47.129" style="s2">right but if you put a human you know in</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.539" end="00:23:51.779" style="s2">a space station or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.129" end="00:23:53.789" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a completely against life</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.779" end="00:24:00.509" style="s2">environment and here we have this</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.789" end="00:24:02.519" style="s2">amazing sort of evolutionary accelerator</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.509" end="00:24:04.589" style="s2">with all these trillions of different</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.519" end="00:24:06.679" style="s2">conservation xand it&#39;s just to me this</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.589" end="00:24:10.499" style="s2">is the absolutely most precious thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.679" end="00:24:14.039" style="s2">but what I wanted to say long way around</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.499" end="00:24:18.059" style="s2">here is that Earth is a planet in space</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.039" end="00:24:21.890" style="s2">and so what that fundamentally means is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.059" end="00:24:25.880" style="s2">that what we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.890" end="00:24:28.549" style="s2">alien life life on other worlds well</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.880" end="00:24:31.429" style="s2">that&#39;s what our worlds made of that&#39;s us</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.549" end="00:24:33.980" style="s2">we are alien life like if you go to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.429" end="00:24:38.210" style="s2">planet in space and there&#39;s life on it</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.980" end="00:24:41.620" style="s2">Oh sir that&#39;s life from space time right</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.210" end="00:24:50.600" style="s2">that&#39;s crazily exotic unexpectedly</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.620" end="00:24:52.850" style="s2">amazing life right so so can I just</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.600" end="00:25:03.100" style="s2">could I just throw something at you here</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.850" end="00:25:10.940" style="s2">hang on for just check in here hello hi</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.100" end="00:25:12.919" style="s2">I&#39;m still on for the moment is there</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.940" end="00:25:19.070" style="s2">anything we need to do are we just going</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.919" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">to check in okay I&#39;ll call you back</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.070" end="00:25:29.660" style="s2">thanks sorry about that no worries um</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.530" style="s2">can I throw it something can I just you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.660" end="00:25:35.150" style="s2">know let me just finish what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.530" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">excuse me so um when we look at any</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.150" end="00:25:40.910" style="s2">organism on earth from my perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:43.970" style="s2">a perspective that I prefer what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.910" end="00:25:47.059" style="s2">seeing are the qualities and characters</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.970" end="00:25:50.450" style="s2">of time space uniquely instanced in an</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.059" end="00:25:54.220" style="s2">organism and what that means to me is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.450" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">that Earth is like this unimaginably</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.220" end="00:26:01.610" style="s2">sophisticated library of organismal</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:06.110" style="s2">forms and relationships and sentience</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.610" end="00:26:12.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a mirror of the fundamental nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.110" end="00:26:15.860" style="s2">of time space and that mirror is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.610" end="00:26:18.860" style="s2">infinitely profoundly exotic and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.860" end="00:26:23.830" style="s2">beautiful and intelligent and shocking</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.860" end="00:26:26.929" style="s2">to directly encounter when we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.830" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">state of mind where we become available</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.929" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">to that so one of the things that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:35.960" style="s2">like to help people who are interested</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:38.410" style="s2">to understand is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.960" end="00:26:41.390" style="s2">incredible opportunity to contact</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.410" end="00:26:43.940" style="s2">non-human intelligence right here on</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.390" end="00:26:46.420" style="s2">earth and the chances of us doing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.940" end="00:26:50.330" style="s2">with a spacecraft are essentially zero</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.420" end="00:26:54.760" style="s2">right we have everything we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.330" end="00:26:56.810" style="s2">touch the intelligence of time space and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.760" end="00:26:59.060" style="s2">intelligences that we might imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.810" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">exists on other worlds right here and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.060" end="00:27:04.430" style="s2">we&#39;re busy burning that down to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:06.920" style="s2">spaceships to go nowhere that we connect</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.430" end="00:27:09.500" style="s2">like we&#39;re just not gonna find complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.920" end="00:27:12.740" style="s2">organisms anywhere near our planet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.500" end="00:27:16.610" style="s2">extremely unlikely not impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.740" end="00:27:20.840" style="s2">extremely unlikely so it&#39;s ironic and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.610" end="00:27:23.480" style="s2">common that we&#39;re burning up the exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.840" end="00:27:27.260" style="s2">what we hope to encounter because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.480" end="00:27:30.770" style="s2">presuming that we can only find life</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.260" end="00:27:33.590" style="s2">from time-space on other planets and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.770" end="00:27:36.440" style="s2">this is a typically human kind of myopia</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.590" end="00:27:39.350" style="s2">whereas what&#39;s actually going on here is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.440" end="00:27:42.590" style="s2">more than anything we&#39;ve ever imagined</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.350" end="00:27:47.290" style="s2">to be going on on other planets and in</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.590" end="00:27:49.790" style="s2">fact I strongly suspect that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.290" end="00:27:53.050" style="s2">if there are living planets in space</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.790" end="00:27:56.690" style="s2">time and I believe there probably are</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.050" end="00:27:58.700" style="s2">that these planets share information</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.690" end="00:28:01.340" style="s2">across impossible distances and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.700" end="00:28:03.980" style="s2">information involves the involves is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.340" end="00:28:06.110" style="s2">involved with the forms and development</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.980" end="00:28:09.260" style="s2">of life on Earth directly so that not</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.110" end="00:28:12.830" style="s2">only do we have a library of what has</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.260" end="00:28:14.930" style="s2">happened here on earth I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.830" end="00:28:19.070" style="s2">the relationship between living planets</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.930" end="00:28:21.590" style="s2">in space time is expressed here and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.070" end="00:28:24.920" style="s2">means that at least in theory we would</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.590" end="00:28:27.050" style="s2">have access to the intelligences that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.920" end="00:28:29.660" style="s2">have evolved on other worlds right here</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.050" end="00:28:32.300" style="s2">without having to go anywhere and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.660" end="00:28:34.690" style="s2">is part of my suspicion about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.300" end="00:28:37.280" style="s2">of time space in general which is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.690" end="00:28:39.380" style="s2">you can&#39;t have a living world like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.280" end="00:28:41.420" style="s2">unless all the others are included in</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.380" end="00:28:45.470" style="s2">other words what you&#39;ll find out there</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.420" end="00:28:47.450" style="s2">you can find right here so you know when</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.470" end="00:28:49.130" style="s2">when there&#39;s these religious people have</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.450" end="00:28:50.420" style="s2">religious experiences</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.130" end="00:28:53.630" style="s2">that what&#39;s happening are they</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.420" end="00:28:57.160" style="s2">contacting what you would call alien</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.630" end="00:29:00.650" style="s2">flight forces well that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.160" end="00:29:02.510" style="s2">sophisticated topic and like most of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.650" end="00:29:06.610" style="s2">topics that we might examine about</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.510" end="00:29:09.070" style="s2">humans in general and I&#39;d like to make a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.610" end="00:29:12.770" style="s2">distinction here between talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.070" end="00:29:14.840" style="s2">abstractly about something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.770" end="00:29:16.850" style="s2">not actually in the presence of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.840" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not right with right now right</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.850" end="00:29:22.160" style="s2">about people in general or the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:24.800" style="s2">idea that there&#39;s a we we often say like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.160" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">we without actually having formed belief</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.800" end="00:29:29.270" style="s2">right we&#39;re just talking about some idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:31.370" style="s2">we have about if there was a lead or the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.270" end="00:29:34.940" style="s2">we that were passively included in</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.370" end="00:29:37.160" style="s2">because we live in America did this</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.940" end="00:29:40.360" style="s2">between talking about contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.160" end="00:29:43.430" style="s2">persons Australia and actually being</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.360" end="00:29:45.230" style="s2">directly engaged with a person or a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.430" end="00:29:46.520" style="s2">situation that we are examining while</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.230" end="00:29:49.010" style="s2">we&#39;re engaged with it because these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.520" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">two very different kinds of thought that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.010" end="00:29:54.260" style="s2">we don&#39;t we&#39;re not careful enough about</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">in my perspective and it&#39;s useful just</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.260" end="00:29:57.890" style="s2">to acknowledge the difference and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.290" style="s2">don&#39;t have to say one is wrong or when</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.890" end="00:30:02.810" style="s2">it&#39;s right but it&#39;s useful to notice</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.290" end="00:30:05.930" style="s2">when we move to the abstract people in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.810" end="00:30:07.700" style="s2">general or topic in general and then we</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.930" end="00:30:10.580" style="s2">talk about something specific so I find</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.700" end="00:30:12.680" style="s2">myself doing that actually I hear my</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.580" end="00:30:16.580" style="s2">voice and I think I&#39;m just using words</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.680" end="00:30:18.560" style="s2">which are you know modes of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.580" end="00:30:21.170" style="s2">communication which are superficial</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.560" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">because I I I can&#39;t get really to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.170" end="00:30:26.360" style="s2">heart of of what I&#39;m trying to say so</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:29.300" style="s2">it&#39;s this kind of blah blah blah you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.360" end="00:30:31.670" style="s2">understand what I&#39;m saying so I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.300" end="00:30:34.100" style="s2">throw these these these these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.670" end="00:30:38.900" style="s2">up in the air but there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.100" end="00:30:45.910" style="s2">between let&#39;s say felt communication and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.900" end="00:30:48.680" style="s2">and and just just dry abstraction or yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.910" end="00:30:50.990" style="s2">yeah I mean I think very carefully about</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.680" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">how we relate with language and concepts</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.990" end="00:30:57.500" style="s2">so this is part of why I&#39;m aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:58.910" style="s2">but to return to your question when we</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.500" end="00:31:02.770" style="s2">talk about people having religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.910" end="00:31:02.770" style="s2">experiences we have the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.430" end="00:31:08.330" style="s2">confusions and problems that we have if</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.900" end="00:31:11.390" style="s2">we talk about people who claim to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.330" end="00:31:15.170" style="s2">encountered aliens and we have vast</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.390" end="00:31:18.980" style="s2">range of incredible diversity we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.170" end="00:31:21.470" style="s2">people who it&#39;s very clear from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.980" end="00:31:25.160" style="s2">results have had some kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.470" end="00:31:26.510" style="s2">authentic experience can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.160" end="00:31:29.180" style="s2">something very meaningful about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.510" end="00:31:31.390" style="s2">experience or sometimes not but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.180" end="00:31:34.940" style="s2">still obvious like this is a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.390" end="00:31:37.100" style="s2">and then we have a whole range of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.940" end="00:31:40.520" style="s2">that&#39;s delusional or based on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.100" end="00:31:43.010" style="s2">narrative a story that they believe or</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.520" end="00:31:45.110" style="s2">is actually psychotic</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.110" end="00:32:18.850" style="s2">that may be an experience of contact</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.050" end="00:32:24.860" style="s2">with some kind of non-human intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.850" end="00:32:30.050" style="s2">but even that phrase brings in a wide</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.860" end="00:32:34.310" style="s2">range of possibilities so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.050" end="00:32:37.280" style="s2">might discriminate between what I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.310" end="00:32:39.230" style="s2">call contact with a nonhuman</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.280" end="00:32:43.250" style="s2">intelligence which of course can happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.230" end="00:32:46.130" style="s2">with a tree or a bird or an insect but</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.250" end="00:32:51.130" style="s2">there&#39;s again a vast range and probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.130" end="00:32:55.580" style="s2">levels of complexity and then a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.130" end="00:33:01.850" style="s2">spiritual experience which perhaps has</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.580" end="00:33:04.310" style="s2">more to do with a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.850" end="00:33:08.060" style="s2">features of the universe that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.310" end="00:33:11.510" style="s2">ordinarily invisible to us and that may</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.060" end="00:33:13.730" style="s2">include beings that are ordinarily not</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.510" end="00:33:17.660" style="s2">part of our conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.730" end="00:33:20.750" style="s2">or so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s how I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.660" end="00:33:22.600" style="s2">begin to respond to that question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.750" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">just that there&#39;s a vast range of</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.600" end="00:33:30.800" style="s2">possibilities and we need to take each</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:32.660" style="s2">case somewhat uniquely because each</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.800" end="00:33:35.510" style="s2">person is unique and each person is</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.660" end="00:33:39.280" style="s2">unique in every moment in circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.510" end="00:33:41.450" style="s2">that they&#39;re in but yeah sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.280" end="00:33:42.800" style="s2">contact with non-human intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.450" end="00:33:46.570" style="s2">could have to do with something in</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.800" end="00:33:51.460" style="s2">nature and perhaps religious experiences</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.570" end="00:33:57.650" style="s2">have to do with something that I might</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.460" end="00:34:03.110" style="s2">frame as an experience of the aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.650" end="00:34:06.830" style="s2">reality that is related to origin where</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.110" end="00:34:10.730" style="s2">everything comes from right in the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.830" end="00:34:12.620" style="s2">way I can think of earth as a mirror in</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.730" end="00:34:15.050" style="s2">which all of the intelligences of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.620" end="00:34:19.190" style="s2">time-space are reflected in actual</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.050" end="00:34:22.430" style="s2">organisms okay I can also think of earth</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.190" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">as a mirror in which the world of origin</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.430" end="00:34:28.490" style="s2">is reflected in forms and relationships</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:35.090" style="s2">and dreaming so the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.490" end="00:34:38.300" style="s2">between an experience of the source of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.090" end="00:34:40.190" style="s2">all these other experiences and and all</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.300" end="00:34:43.370" style="s2">the different manifestations of that of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.190" end="00:34:45.050" style="s2">that source yeah and you know I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.370" end="00:34:48.280" style="s2">that when I was in my 20s I did</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.050" end="00:34:50.810" style="s2">psychedelics and had kind of unusual</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.280" end="00:34:53.090" style="s2">experiences but then I got kind of sick</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.810" end="00:34:54.680" style="s2">of that and it just didn&#39;t seem to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.090" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">anywhere there seems to be an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.680" end="00:34:59.510" style="s2">amount of experiences that you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">have but but then after that I started</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.510" end="00:35:03.500" style="s2">to get into meditation which was more</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">like a cleaning up of the mind and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.500" end="00:35:13.610" style="s2">then I going into all the different</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:16.490" style="s2">forms of experience yes and I to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.610" end="00:35:19.160" style="s2">been a practitioner of Zen meditation</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.490" end="00:35:21.530" style="s2">now for some thirty years so I have some</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.160" end="00:35:23.670" style="s2">familiarity with with that particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.530" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">branch of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.670" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">though I don&#39;t necessarily consider</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:34.110" style="s2">myself above it&#39;s okay if I may I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:39.260" style="s2">to return to an earlier question that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.110" end="00:35:39.260" style="s2">you had and I&#39;ll preface this by saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:50.570" style="s2">people who are considered by others to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:52.950" style="s2">be very intelligent I think everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.570" end="00:35:56.150" style="s2">very intelligent I just think it gets</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.950" end="00:35:59.700" style="s2">expressed uniquely each and each group</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.150" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">but um intellectuals particularly suffer</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.700" end="00:36:05.070" style="s2">from this kind of disease that I&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:09.270" style="s2">share the damage and it&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.070" end="00:36:11.310" style="s2">where you know people go around telling</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.270" end="00:36:14.640" style="s2">each other about the bad news in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.310" end="00:36:18.510" style="s2">terrifying future and the incredible</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.640" end="00:36:19.800" style="s2">problem and this kind of thing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.510" end="00:36:23.640" style="s2">been my experience that this is an</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.800" end="00:36:26.190" style="s2">extremely toxic habit only does it not</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.640" end="00:36:29.180" style="s2">solve the problem it&#39;s debilitating for</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.190" end="00:36:32.070" style="s2">the people who are subjected to it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.180" end="00:36:34.650" style="s2">some of my closer friends in my youth</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.070" end="00:36:37.410" style="s2">were the first people that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.650" end="00:36:41.160" style="s2">exhibiting symptoms of this problem and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.410" end="00:36:43.730" style="s2">sharing the damage and I&#39;m to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.160" end="00:36:46.200" style="s2">not a fan that&#39;s a gross understatement</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.730" end="00:36:49.800" style="s2">of that kind of behavior because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.200" end="00:36:52.140" style="s2">just it&#39;s it&#39;s just catastrophic both</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.800" end="00:36:54.870" style="s2">for the person who becomes involved in</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.140" end="00:36:56.990" style="s2">that habit and for the people who they</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.870" end="00:36:59.340" style="s2">communicate with it&#39;s it&#39;s really like</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.990" end="00:37:04.260" style="s2">spreading and magnifying a disease of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.340" end="00:37:07.080" style="s2">helplessness and fear so although I talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.260" end="00:37:09.410" style="s2">about problems and dangers that we face</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.080" end="00:37:12.900" style="s2">as moderns</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.410" end="00:37:16.230" style="s2">my I felt sense of those problems is</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.900" end="00:37:20.100" style="s2">creative and I like to think about I</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.230" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">like to back-trace the problem to its</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.100" end="00:37:26.520" style="s2">origins and mode and what motivates its</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:31.380" style="s2">forms and its expressions and then see</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.520" end="00:37:33.330" style="s2">how those can be inverted and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.380" end="00:37:37.410" style="s2">studying social media and now for</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.330" end="00:37:39.540" style="s2">probably 12 15 years closely and my</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.410" end="00:37:41.700" style="s2">primary interest was in both</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.540" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">understanding the dangers involved and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.700" end="00:37:45.710" style="s2">then perhaps inventing something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">could invert those dangers and give us</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.710" end="00:37:50.550" style="s2">not only freedom from the dangers but</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:52.170" style="s2">access to the opportunities right</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.550" end="00:37:54.750" style="s2">because when you went on Facebook I</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.170" end="00:37:56.820" style="s2">remember you saying that I&#39;ve come here</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.750" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">to warn people that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.820" end="00:38:02.100" style="s2">destructive technology and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:05.000" style="s2">time you were saying well there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.100" end="00:38:09.660" style="s2">incredible power and impossibility</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.000" end="00:38:12.600" style="s2">happening here simultaneously so which</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.660" end="00:38:15.360" style="s2">is absolute it isn&#39;t either it&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.600" end="00:38:19.080" style="s2">do with it that makes that decision so</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.360" end="00:38:20.730" style="s2">for example how do we use Facebook how</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.080" end="00:38:25.050" style="s2">do we use social media in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.730" end="00:38:27.150" style="s2">kind of constructive to our souls this</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.050" end="00:38:32.600" style="s2">is what you and I both experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.150" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">this so we obviously have experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.600" end="00:38:39.300" style="s2">learning that yeah Ben for all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:41.550" style="s2">dangers Facebook presents it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.300" end="00:38:44.580" style="s2">extremely useful because I&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.550" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">to form relationships on Facebook that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.580" end="00:38:48.810" style="s2">begin on Facebook that are actually part</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:51.750" style="s2">of my life and heart and that are very</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.810" end="00:38:54.380" style="s2">important to me and that means that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.750" end="00:38:56.340" style="s2">Facebook allow me to initiate</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.380" end="00:38:59.270" style="s2">relationships with people who I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.340" end="00:39:05.640" style="s2">otherwise have no possible contact with</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.270" end="00:39:10.950" style="s2">positive features of Facebook itself but</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.640" end="00:39:14.070" style="s2">I have a model of how we could radically</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.950" end="00:39:18.380" style="s2">invert the systems that were presently</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.070" end="00:39:18.380" style="s2">subjected to and we talked into and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.290" end="00:39:26.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not something I&#39;m particularly on</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">fire about evangelizing but I find it</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:33.190" style="s2">the potentials for astonishing new ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:35.740" style="s2">of being human and intelligent together</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.190" end="00:39:42.760" style="s2">to be really exciting can you give an</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.740" end="00:39:46.359" style="s2">example yeah so I&#39;m gonna do my four</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.760" end="00:39:49.090" style="s2">minute elevator pitch shooter okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.359" end="00:39:52.210" style="s2">fine keep it really brief we&#39;re using a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.090" end="00:39:56.140" style="s2">browser that was invented in 1989 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.210" end="00:39:58.590" style="s2">2018 time on the Internet is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.140" end="00:40:01.090" style="s2">accelerated so for something like</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.590" end="00:40:03.880" style="s2">thousands of years of human experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.090" end="00:40:05.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve been using this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.880" end="00:40:08.530" style="s2">antiquated piece of garbage that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.710" end="00:40:10.810" style="s2">actually changes our minds to work like</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.530" end="00:40:13.630" style="s2">it and it works like the index of a book</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.810" end="00:40:17.470" style="s2">and our minds don&#39;t work like the index</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.630" end="00:40:19.240" style="s2">of a book it&#39;s like - it&#39;s the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.470" end="00:40:22.510" style="s2">analogous to music and listen listening</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.240" end="00:40:27.880" style="s2">to mp3s right and in CDs which are kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.510" end="00:40:32.830" style="s2">of antiquated sonic experiences stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.880" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">1985 or right so we&#39;re getting um all</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.830" end="00:40:39.670" style="s2">kinds of artifacting by compression</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:42.670" style="s2">damage to our minds and our because of</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.670" end="00:40:45.369" style="s2">our relationships with machines and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.670" end="00:40:49.630" style="s2">metaphors that they subconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.369" end="00:40:52.210" style="s2">consciously present we&#39;re in danger of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.630" end="00:40:54.430" style="s2">having our our fundamental way of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.210" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">in the world and our minds changed to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.430" end="00:41:03.310" style="s2">like broken old machines so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:05.470" style="s2">it&#39;s now very us it would be a simple</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.310" end="00:41:08.170" style="s2">map no one has even had one better idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.470" end="00:41:09.550" style="s2">than the way we currently interface with</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.170" end="00:41:11.380" style="s2">the Internet which is through an</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.550" end="00:41:13.710" style="s2">incredibly antiquated browser that</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.380" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">really hasn&#39;t changes changes invented</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.710" end="00:41:17.530" style="s2">so the first thing we can do is invent a</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:23.980" style="s2">browser that works more like our minds</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.530" end="00:41:25.720" style="s2">and involves like images for the right</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.980" end="00:41:27.400" style="s2">hemisphere and language for the left</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.720" end="00:41:30.090" style="s2">hemisphere if sitting in my room right</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.400" end="00:41:32.170" style="s2">now where I have books over here</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.090" end="00:41:32.700" style="s2">television images over here if you look</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.170" end="00:41:34.140" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.700" end="00:41:36.570" style="s2">people&#39;s rooms you&#39;re going to see this</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.140" end="00:41:38.520" style="s2">all over the place it&#39;s not absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.570" end="00:41:40.320" style="s2">the same in every place but you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.520" end="00:41:42.390" style="s2">find out that people naturally organize</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.320" end="00:41:44.130" style="s2">their world for hemispherical</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.390" end="00:41:46.740" style="s2">lateralization right you&#39;re gonna sign</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.130" end="00:41:50.040" style="s2">books on one side images on the other</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.740" end="00:41:51.329" style="s2">essentially you know in this pen so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.040" end="00:41:55.530" style="s2">can build a browser that works more like</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.329" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">our minds and that uses the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.530" end="00:42:03.570" style="s2">of connotation rather than denotation</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:05.609" style="s2">right so can you explain that yes so we</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.570" end="00:42:07.910" style="s2">understand things not by their literal</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.609" end="00:42:10.740" style="s2">definitions but by their associations</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.910" end="00:42:12.990" style="s2">this is how our minds actually more like</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.740" end="00:42:16.020" style="s2">how our minds work how the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.990" end="00:42:18.150" style="s2">hemisphere works no they both work this</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.020" end="00:42:20.190" style="s2">way okay if you didn&#39;t have associations</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.150" end="00:42:23.849" style="s2">your left hemisphere would be incapable</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.190" end="00:42:26.190" style="s2">of understanding words okay but what</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.849" end="00:42:27.829" style="s2">I&#39;ve understood from Achilles book is</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.190" end="00:42:31.020" style="s2">that the right hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.829" end="00:42:33.480" style="s2">metaphorical and-and-and and makes sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.020" end="00:42:35.970" style="s2">of you know wild they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.480" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">contextual associations whereas the left</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.970" end="00:42:42.660" style="s2">brain is is more literal and map map</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:45.329" style="s2">making and that&#39;s true but they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.660" end="00:42:46.980" style="s2">involved in each other&#39;s processes right</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.329" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">there&#39;s not a really clear distinction</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.980" end="00:42:52.020" style="s2">so one of the things that I would do is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:54.329" style="s2">I would build a browser that works much</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.020" end="00:42:55.710" style="s2">like our minds and instead of telling</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.329" end="00:42:59.630" style="s2">you a lot about what that would look</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.710" end="00:43:02.869" style="s2">like although it&#39;s pretty astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.630" end="00:43:06.540" style="s2">I&#39;ll continue with the other portions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.869" end="00:43:09.300" style="s2">the model that I have so step one would</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.540" end="00:43:10.740" style="s2">be a browser that actually works more</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.300" end="00:43:12.450" style="s2">like our minds and learns how it</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.740" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">continually learns how to work how our</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.450" end="00:43:19.140" style="s2">minds work individually and as groups</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:21.180" style="s2">the second aspect would be the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.140" end="00:43:26.310" style="s2">localization of all of our analytic data</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.180" end="00:43:32.520" style="s2">in a specific artifact write a file if</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.310" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">you will that has layers it should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.520" end="00:43:38.069" style="s2">like a world layer national layer local</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:41.600" style="s2">layer an acquaintance layer close</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.069" end="00:43:47.330" style="s2">friends layer family layer and personal</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.600" end="00:43:50.060" style="s2">right and it would organize and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.330" end="00:43:51.800" style="s2">allow us to make use of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.060" end="00:43:53.900" style="s2">analytic data that&#39;s produced by our</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.800" end="00:43:56.270" style="s2">interactions with devices all of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.900" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">because a lot more this is coming and is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.270" end="00:44:00.830" style="s2">presently at hand there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:04.790" style="s2">health data there&#39;s gonna be analytics</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.830" end="00:44:08.050" style="s2">from having our bodies read by machines</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.790" end="00:44:10.910" style="s2">our movements our pulses our breathing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.050" end="00:44:14.360" style="s2">probably our blood pressure stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.910" end="00:44:16.520" style="s2">this and even relatively primitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.360" end="00:44:19.310" style="s2">devices are already capable of this like</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.520" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">the Kinect for Xbox a--&#39;s can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.310" end="00:44:25.850" style="s2">your eyes are doing stuff like this and</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">can read your pulse so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.850" end="00:44:29.780" style="s2">stuff is incredibly dangerous to put in</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:31.340" style="s2">the hands of other people like so</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.780" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">dangerous that it&#39;s unimaginably</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.340" end="00:44:36.740" style="s2">dangerous but we could do something</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">really astonishing with that data if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.740" end="00:44:42.440" style="s2">gathered it for ourselves and for each</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:44.750" style="s2">other networks of related interest in</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.440" end="00:44:48.470" style="s2">activity is this related to your concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.750" end="00:44:52.520" style="s2">of pods like you talked about a pod</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.470" end="00:44:54.590" style="s2">being the kind of ultimate sort of human</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.520" end="00:44:57.410" style="s2">organization like and you related that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.590" end="00:44:59.930" style="s2">to a pod of dolphins yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.410" end="00:45:04.150" style="s2">fundamentally humans are animals that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.930" end="00:45:06.590" style="s2">were evolved to function healthily and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.150" end="00:45:10.250" style="s2">effectively in small very tightly knit</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.590" end="00:45:13.790" style="s2">groups of shared interest in concern of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.250" end="00:45:15.350" style="s2">course in case this isn&#39;t clear someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.790" end="00:45:17.690" style="s2">wants an example you can just look like</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.350" end="00:45:21.980" style="s2">for the representation of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.690" end="00:45:24.320" style="s2">a sports team right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.980" end="00:45:26.150" style="s2">they do the impossible there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.320" end="00:45:28.130" style="s2">considered to be like superhuman</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.150" end="00:45:30.920" style="s2">right another example be like a rock</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.130" end="00:45:33.080" style="s2">band you get like five hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.920" end="00:45:36.140" style="s2">people together to watch a bunch of guys</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.080" end="00:45:38.600" style="s2">kicking a ball or why yeah why is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.140" end="00:45:42.440" style="s2">so compelling well it&#39;s so compelling</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.600" end="00:45:46.300" style="s2">because we&#39;re not doing it so we want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.440" end="00:45:49.790" style="s2">participate in in this sort of projected</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.300" end="00:45:51.260" style="s2">representation of that happening and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.790" end="00:45:52.730" style="s2">mean another thing that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.260" end="00:45:54.080" style="s2">interesting to me is just like what if</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.730" end="00:45:54.980" style="s2">we got those five hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.080" end="00:45:57.230" style="s2">people together</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.980" end="00:46:01.670" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually mattered even for an</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.230" end="00:46:06.590" style="s2">hour what we do with that so we were</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.670" end="00:46:10.300" style="s2">talking about solution and I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.590" end="00:46:13.010" style="s2">that I have a model and the model has</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.300" end="00:46:14.540" style="s2">five or six elements one is a browser</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.010" end="00:46:17.150" style="s2">that works more like our minds and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.540" end="00:46:24.710" style="s2">learns how each of our individual minds</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.150" end="00:46:27.380" style="s2">work what is a the data artifact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.710" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">associated with our analytics and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.380" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">is something that can be devoted both</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:35.869" style="s2">personally and in layers of networks so</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:40.130" style="s2">this is one of the most astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.869" end="00:46:42.710" style="s2">things is we could actually build data</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.130" end="00:46:44.210" style="s2">artifacts like this I call it the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.710" end="00:46:45.859" style="s2">CAW</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.210" end="00:46:48.440" style="s2">which really just means knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.859" end="00:46:50.690" style="s2">artifact but how&#39;s that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.440" end="00:46:56.990" style="s2">Sonata me with the Egyptian soul or</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.690" end="00:46:58.850" style="s2">whatever each of these features is very</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.990" end="00:47:02.750" style="s2">sophisticated and what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.850" end="00:47:05.260" style="s2">present is just a really simple quick so</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.750" end="00:47:08.750" style="s2">the car we could actually build a car</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.260" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">for people who no longer alive so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.750" end="00:47:13.460" style="s2">you could search the internet the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:15.920" style="s2">Einsteins mind worked or the way some</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.460" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">you know like Henry Thoreau&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.920" end="00:47:19.250" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:22.430" style="s2">you could build a car from text based</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.250" end="00:47:25.580" style="s2">records of people&#39;s writing even before</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.430" end="00:47:29.300" style="s2">the internet existed and you could just</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.580" end="00:47:32.690" style="s2">basically swap out like someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.300" end="00:47:35.600" style="s2">call for yours and and get an experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.690" end="00:47:38.150" style="s2">of relating with information more like</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.600" end="00:47:42.230" style="s2">another person&#39;s mind or the mind of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.150" end="00:47:46.010" style="s2">group all kinds of features that we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.230" end="00:47:48.920" style="s2">nothing even vaguely resembling today so</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.010" end="00:47:52.220" style="s2">the knowledge artifact is is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.920" end="00:47:54.680" style="s2">fundamental heart of the system which I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.220" end="00:47:59.540" style="s2">call the knowledge him so it would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.680" end="00:48:03.950" style="s2">like searching in somebody&#39;s mind the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.540" end="00:48:04.840" style="s2">Kaw informs how information is related</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.950" end="00:48:08.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.840" end="00:48:09.700" style="s2">and it informs it by using the analytic</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.440" end="00:48:12.940" style="s2">data that we&#39;ve gathered about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.700" end="00:48:19.950" style="s2">or another person or group and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.940" end="00:48:19.950" style="s2">becomes the how to put this the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.940" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">perspective the organizing perspective</p>

<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:37.810" style="s2">information and it&#39;s basically just a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.690" end="00:48:41.020" style="s2">layered resource made from analytics and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.810" end="00:48:45.340" style="s2">those analytics can inform each other in</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.020" end="00:48:52.470" style="s2">networks and the basic model of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.340" end="00:48:55.540" style="s2">involves what I&#39;d call human assisted</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.470" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">artificial intelligence so we teach</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.540" end="00:49:02.050" style="s2">machines how to learn about us rather</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:06.670" style="s2">than rather than the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.050" end="00:49:08.050" style="s2">yeah the other way around and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.670" end="00:49:10.750" style="s2">the future really lies in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.050" end="00:49:12.820" style="s2">and that is the essential problem with</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.750" end="00:49:15.010" style="s2">artificial intelligence isn&#39;t it that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.820" end="00:49:16.570" style="s2">the machine would would have control</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.010" end="00:49:18.760" style="s2">over the human rather than the other way</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.570" end="00:49:20.770" style="s2">around I mean so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.760" end="00:49:22.600" style="s2">problems so the first the first problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.770" end="00:49:24.540" style="s2">I have is is that I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.600" end="00:49:26.980" style="s2">artificial intelligence is just simply</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.540" end="00:49:28.360" style="s2">wrong there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.980" end="00:49:30.310" style="s2">artificial intelligence what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.360" end="00:49:32.680" style="s2">actually doing is computation we should</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.310" end="00:49:35.830" style="s2">call that computation we shouldn&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.680" end="00:49:38.410" style="s2">it intelligence if if our species is</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.830" end="00:49:41.350" style="s2">intelligent I can&#39;t find much evidence</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.410" end="00:49:43.270" style="s2">of that so before we could invent an</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.350" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">artificial intelligence we would</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.270" end="00:49:47.170" style="s2">probably have to ourselves become</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:50.680" style="s2">reasonably intelligent or have some idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.170" end="00:49:52.540" style="s2">a meaningful idea a healthy idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.680" end="00:49:55.510" style="s2">intelligence actually means it looks</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.540" end="00:49:59.470" style="s2">like me it doesn&#39;t mean or look like</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.510" end="00:50:02.890" style="s2">what we usually associate with it but to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:04.350" style="s2">stay on topic briefly so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.890" end="00:50:08.050" style="s2">browser that works like our minds</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.350" end="00:50:11.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a localized store of analytic</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.050" end="00:50:14.550" style="s2">data that can include a mean formed by</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.020" end="00:50:18.040" style="s2">all of our interactions with information</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.550" end="00:50:22.150" style="s2">emails texts whatever we make whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.040" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">we do even biomedical data then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.150" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">a thing that I call the funny I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:43.990" style="s2">thought about this in a while so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:46.840" style="s2">a an aspect of the the model that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.990" end="00:50:51.490" style="s2">would build a database that would allow</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.840" end="00:50:53.980" style="s2">us to have essentially a readout on any</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.490" end="00:50:58.630" style="s2">media item that we might be exposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.980" end="00:51:04.120" style="s2">piece of news a video of someone talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.630" end="00:51:06.970" style="s2">about something a text an email and what</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.120" end="00:51:09.820" style="s2">this would allow us to do is to get very</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.970" end="00:51:15.330" style="s2">very sophisticated analytical data about</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.820" end="00:51:17.050" style="s2">the origins of a piece of media what</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.330" end="00:51:19.480" style="s2">related topics</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.050" end="00:51:22.900" style="s2">informed it who&#39;s making money if it</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.480" end="00:51:26.800" style="s2">gets circulated what the agenda of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.900" end="00:51:31.150" style="s2">creator is so it&#39;s a vetting Sentinel</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.800" end="00:51:34.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the excuse me that&#39;s the specific</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.150" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">title I came up with excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.210" end="00:51:38.140" style="s2">so how would that not become something</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:40.750" style="s2">that would be another form of</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.140" end="00:51:42.340" style="s2">surveillance like you know this is just</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.750" end="00:51:44.920" style="s2">gonna have that anyway so the question</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.340" end="00:51:47.590" style="s2">is do we build it for each other in ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.920" end="00:51:50.380" style="s2">that are useful and helpful and help us</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.590" end="00:51:53.050" style="s2">to be smarter or do we let other people</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.380" end="00:51:55.210" style="s2">do it for us right so if let&#39;s say I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.050" end="00:51:57.850" style="s2">betting Sentinel in our minds like one</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.210" end="00:52:01.570" style="s2">of the reasons why I have this element</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.850" end="00:52:03.100" style="s2">is we each have one of these already</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.570" end="00:52:06.460" style="s2">with which we determine whether</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.100" end="00:52:09.490" style="s2">information is trustworthy or not whose</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.460" end="00:52:11.080" style="s2">interest is this information in and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.490" end="00:52:13.720" style="s2">problem were the one that we have is</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.080" end="00:52:16.870" style="s2">that it&#39;s extremely poorly educated so</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.720" end="00:52:19.270" style="s2">the goal of creating a human assisted AI</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.870" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">version of the betting Sentinel would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.270" end="00:52:26.070" style="s2">to eliminate the possibility of content</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:31.570" style="s2">that was mostly lies mostly propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.070" end="00:52:33.940" style="s2">identify rhetorical errors or movements</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.570" end="00:52:36.910" style="s2">in texts or speeches from political</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.940" end="00:52:39.490" style="s2">people just we could see we would just</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.910" end="00:52:42.850" style="s2">get a window of incredible usefulness</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.490" end="00:52:46.510" style="s2">into the authenticity or the lack</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.850" end="00:52:49.240" style="s2">thereof of various media item saying one</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.510" end="00:52:53.290" style="s2">of the things that would do is it would</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.240" end="00:52:55.150" style="s2">kill garbage right it would just totally</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.290" end="00:52:58.660" style="s2">expose stuff that it was completely</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.150" end="00:53:00.490" style="s2">made-up or filled with lies or just</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.660" end="00:53:02.260" style="s2">propaganda and would make it really</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.490" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">really difficult for for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.260" end="00:53:08.740" style="s2">political people to speak in any way</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:11.700" style="s2">that could be authorized by any audience</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.740" end="00:53:12.970" style="s2">after having been taken apart this way</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.700" end="00:53:14.980" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.970" end="00:53:17.100" style="s2">so again I&#39;m still having this I had</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.980" end="00:53:20.140" style="s2">this reservation in the sense that I say</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.100" end="00:53:22.450" style="s2">you know let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s say I put</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.140" end="00:53:25.210" style="s2">this video up me and you talking and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.450" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">then somebody can find layers of you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.210" end="00:53:32.110" style="s2">know of what is real and what is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:34.120" style="s2">real who decides what is real and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.110" end="00:53:39.270" style="s2">is not real and how do we model that</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.120" end="00:53:39.270" style="s2">correctly I mean it&#39;s a good question so</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.540" end="00:53:48.010" style="s2">what&#39;s the authority here like behind it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.940" end="00:53:50.440" style="s2">I mean so firstly very few human beings</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.010" end="00:53:58.060" style="s2">are rhetorically educated now what that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.440" end="00:54:01.540" style="s2">means is they are not intelligent enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.060" end="00:54:04.450" style="s2">to understand the difference for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.540" end="00:54:07.840" style="s2">as an example between something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.450" end="00:54:09.610" style="s2">absolutely cannot be true something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.840" end="00:54:13.710" style="s2">it just it&#39;s impossible if this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.610" end="00:54:17.050" style="s2">true something that might be true and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.710" end="00:54:22.120" style="s2">something that is relatively likely to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.050" end="00:54:26.020" style="s2">be true in a specific context since true</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.120" end="00:54:27.930" style="s2">right is a pretty deep idea we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.020" end="00:54:30.690" style="s2">talking about the context of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.930" end="00:54:35.010" style="s2">speaking to each other or communicating</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.690" end="00:54:38.830" style="s2">to each other about circumstances ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.010" end="00:54:41.080" style="s2">situations and relationships so because</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.830" end="00:54:44.770" style="s2">most human beings are very poorly</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.080" end="00:54:45.450" style="s2">rhetorically educated and by the way not</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.770" end="00:54:47.369" style="s2">so very</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.450" end="00:54:49.650" style="s2">go in the wealthy classes in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.369" end="00:54:52.200" style="s2">rhetorical education was a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.650" end="00:54:55.650" style="s2">part of elementary school educate our</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.200" end="00:54:59.630" style="s2">children these skills so are linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.650" end="00:55:02.820" style="s2">and conceptual intelligence as moderns</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.630" end="00:55:05.880" style="s2">has been under assault and is you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.820" end="00:55:08.119" style="s2">in a terrible state of disrepair so one</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.880" end="00:55:10.890" style="s2">of the simplest things we could do is</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.119" end="00:55:13.980" style="s2">just point out rhetorical fallacies and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.890" end="00:55:15.750" style="s2">text and that&#39;s something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.980" end="00:55:17.220" style="s2">train a machine to do all day long and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.750" end="00:55:20.690" style="s2">it&#39;s just a fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.220" end="00:55:25.290" style="s2">right this way of saying this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.690" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">both a lie you know or an exaggeration</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.290" end="00:55:33.300" style="s2">or a manipulative move meant to deceive</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:35.430" style="s2">right just that one thing if we could do</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.300" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">just that one thing that would be has a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.430" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">staggering effect and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:42.839" style="s2">that can be done well wouldn&#39;t it sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:44.460" style="s2">of it wouldn&#39;t it kind of destroy 99% of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.839" end="00:55:52.619" style="s2">the discourse between human beings I</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.460" end="00:55:58.890" style="s2">mean no right I mean just on an</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.619" end="00:56:00.750" style="s2">everyday basis you know how to think and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.890" end="00:56:02.700" style="s2">speak in ways there were more</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.750" end="00:56:05.750" style="s2">intelligent and it wouldn&#39;t destroy</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.700" end="00:56:09.210" style="s2">anything it would just give us feedback</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.750" end="00:56:11.220" style="s2">when we&#39;re being exposed to media about</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.210" end="00:56:13.950" style="s2">whether or not this is in any way</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.220" end="00:56:15.630" style="s2">reasonably trustworthy alright you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.950" end="00:56:17.220" style="s2">still make your own your own decision I</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.630" end="00:56:20.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to obeying the Machine</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.220" end="00:56:21.900" style="s2">readout but just this one feature of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.010" end="00:56:24.359" style="s2">rhetorical analysis and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.900" end="00:56:25.829" style="s2">other amazing stuff we can do and in</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.359" end="00:56:28.500" style="s2">terms of who is the authority</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.829" end="00:56:30.599" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a central authority it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.500" end="00:56:33.829" style="s2">distributed Authority it&#39;s humans</p>

<p begin="00:56:33.829" end="00:56:38.550" style="s2">individually right about like my own</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.519" end="00:57:32.609" style="s2">invert that model then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.959" end="00:57:35.999" style="s2">betting Sentinel that would give us a</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.999" end="00:57:40.859" style="s2">looking at what are the orientations and</p>

<p begin="00:57:40.859" end="00:57:46.890" style="s2">makes money if this is circulated that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:49.410" style="s2">would give us a lot of analytic data</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.410" end="00:57:53.999" style="s2">and it would learn how to do that both</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.630" end="00:57:56.849" style="s2">in a group sense from the whole network</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.999" end="00:57:59.579" style="s2">and also in an individual sense from a</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.579" end="00:58:07.170" style="s2">or subgroup then there would be a social</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.150" end="00:58:09.749" style="s2">media aspect that would be like Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.170" end="00:58:13.380" style="s2">except again the analytics come to us</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.749" end="00:58:18.329" style="s2">instead of them and then the final</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.380" end="00:58:21.539" style="s2">component is a team building social</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.329" end="00:58:25.829" style="s2">adventure aspect where we have an avatar</p>

<p begin="00:58:29.849" end="00:58:36.329" style="s2">acquires it&#39;s a it&#39;s a gamification of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:41.069" style="s2">social activism essentially so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.329" end="00:58:46.109" style="s2">avatar acquires an identity and history</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.069" end="00:58:47.549" style="s2">and abilities and statistics about what</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.109" end="00:58:49.229" style="s2">they&#39;ve been involved in what they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.140" end="00:58:59.279" style="s2">specific problems that are facing us as</p>

<p begin="00:59:03.809" end="00:59:07.469" style="s2">well there&#39;s a few things I find</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.789" end="00:59:09.529" style="s2">interesting there is just it&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.469" end="00:59:12.190" style="s2">model of Education right because I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.529" end="00:59:14.349" style="s2">obviously we&#39;re moving in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.190" end="00:59:17.049" style="s2">and the other the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.349" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">interests me is this is what you say</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.049" end="00:59:22.450" style="s2">about social justice and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:26.020" style="s2">gamification because social justice</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.450" end="00:59:32.349" style="s2">today is so corrupt it seems to me you</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.020" end="00:59:34.299" style="s2">know is always is always to be out on</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.349" end="00:59:36.789" style="s2">the street with placards you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.299" end="00:59:38.920" style="s2">against this monolithic you know useless</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.789" end="00:59:44.440" style="s2">and and it doesn&#39;t seem to be very</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.920" end="00:59:47.380" style="s2">intelligent so so so in order to create</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.440" end="00:59:50.170" style="s2">a better better world we have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.380" end="00:59:54.940" style="s2">redefine what social justice it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.170" end="00:59:57.490" style="s2">me what social justice means agreed so</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.940" end="00:59:59.109" style="s2">that&#39;s something I think I can</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.490" end="01:00:03.039" style="s2">understand that from from what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.109" end="01:00:06.099" style="s2">telling me and also just finding new</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.039" end="01:00:08.170" style="s2">organizing principles for for the you</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.099" end="01:00:10.510" style="s2">know breath or how we how we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.170" end="01:00:14.049" style="s2">becoming you know you know changing or</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.510" end="01:00:18.910" style="s2">how we&#39;re changing I can&#39;t even explain</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.049" end="01:00:20.890" style="s2">the profound opportunities that would I</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.910" end="01:00:23.079" style="s2">mean many of them can&#39;t be imagined</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.890" end="01:00:24.609" style="s2">until the system&#39;s instanced but even</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.079" end="01:00:28.029" style="s2">just imagining a system like this</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.609" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">presents staggering opportunities for</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.029" end="01:00:31.000" style="s2">our humanity and for how we relate with</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.880" style="s2">each other and how we relate with</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.000" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">information that unless we do something</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.880" end="01:00:37.390" style="s2">like this we&#39;re going to get the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:41.559" style="s2">opposite of it right we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.390" end="01:00:44.140" style="s2">subjected or already colonized sorry</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.559" end="01:00:46.750" style="s2">we&#39;re already sort of there is a sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.140" end="01:00:48.190" style="s2">right that the human beings are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.750" end="01:00:51.400" style="s2">destroying each other I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.190" end="01:00:53.980" style="s2">feeling that this is what we&#39;re doing I</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.400" end="01:00:55.420" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.980" end="01:00:58.210" style="s2">think a lot of people feel that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.420" end="01:01:00.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s good that you you have some</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.210" end="01:01:02.020" style="s2">whether there&#39;s an optimistic message</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.010" end="01:01:04.599" style="s2">rather than just you know the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.020" end="01:01:06.210" style="s2">nihilism which we could build the basis</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.599" end="01:01:09.180" style="s2">of a system like this in six months</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.210" end="01:01:12.279" style="s2">right now uh-huh</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.180" end="01:01:15.789" style="s2">why are we doing that well because</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.279" end="01:01:20.829" style="s2">nobody&#39;s have this idea okay so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.789" end="01:01:23.020" style="s2">yeah my idea it&#39;s up to me to put the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.829" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">model together market it do something</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.020" end="01:01:25.969" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:28.009" style="s2">so I&#39;ll take responsibility for not</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.969" end="01:01:33.859" style="s2">having completely done that yet I have</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.009" end="01:01:36.259" style="s2">both distractions right I&#39;m a human</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.859" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">being I live a actual human life yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.259" end="01:01:43.699" style="s2">and I also have fears I can&#39;t tell what</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:45.529" style="s2">such a powerful system what effect that</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.699" end="01:01:47.979" style="s2">would have on the future of humanity or</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.529" end="01:01:50.150" style="s2">what kinds of really dangerous things</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.979" end="01:01:51.489" style="s2">could be associated with it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.150" end="01:01:54.920" style="s2">unpredictable</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.489" end="01:01:57.199" style="s2">although my answer to that problem is</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.920" end="01:01:58.849" style="s2">simply well what&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.199" end="01:02:00.979" style="s2">what we&#39;re not doing and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.849" end="01:02:02.569" style="s2">being subjected to is catastrophic ly</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.979" end="01:02:06.650" style="s2">worse than anything this could probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.569" end="01:02:08.809" style="s2">produce so I mean we&#39;re our privacy is</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.650" end="01:02:11.180" style="s2">being colonized our minds are being</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.809" end="01:02:13.969" style="s2">colonized our social networks are being</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.180" end="01:02:16.729" style="s2">colonized and redirected by forces that</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.969" end="01:02:17.900" style="s2">aren&#39;t human corporations are not human</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.729" end="01:02:21.400" style="s2">deed they&#39;re not beings</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.900" end="01:02:24.769" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re like complicated ghosts</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.400" end="01:02:26.239" style="s2">so it&#39;s a terrifying situation that</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.769" end="01:02:28.699" style="s2">we&#39;re actually in and I think very few</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.239" end="01:02:30.619" style="s2">people if it&#39;s not useful to sit around</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.699" end="01:02:32.209" style="s2">being terrified of it I think very few</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.619" end="01:02:36.529" style="s2">people understand the actual</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.209" end="01:02:38.690" style="s2">implications of the capacity for example</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.529" end="01:02:42.499" style="s2">for your computer to know your heart</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.690" end="01:02:47.299" style="s2">rate and know when your pupils are</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.499" end="01:02:49.459" style="s2">dilating or constricting right this will</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.299" end="01:02:51.920" style="s2">allow corporations to directly</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.459" end="01:02:54.529" style="s2">manipulate our emotions our minds our</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.920" end="01:02:57.619" style="s2">interests our attention in a way that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.529" end="01:02:59.660" style="s2">slave-like and the dangers of a system</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.619" end="01:03:01.969" style="s2">like that are staggering and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.660" end="01:03:03.229" style="s2">what&#39;s coming because our machines are</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.969" end="01:03:05.869" style="s2">becoming more and more intimately</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.229" end="01:03:09.559" style="s2">connected with our bodies so we need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.869" end="01:03:12.019" style="s2">move quickly to invent systems that both</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.559" end="01:03:13.789" style="s2">protect us from those dangers and grant</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.019" end="01:03:21.789" style="s2">us the opportunities implicit in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.789" end="01:03:21.789" style="s2">technologies and unexpectedly this is a</p>

<p begin="01:03:23.569" end="01:03:28.279" style="s2">that begin in our own lives and in the</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.279" end="01:03:33.769" style="s2">language is technology it&#39;s a technology</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.849" end="01:03:34.910" style="s2">that does the same kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.769" end="01:03:37.099" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.910" end="01:03:40.190" style="s2">but we never mastered it we were not</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.099" end="01:03:41.720" style="s2">given the powers to creatively and</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.190" end="01:03:44.839" style="s2">intelligently relate with this</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.720" end="01:03:46.339" style="s2">technology and so many you know</p>

<p begin="01:03:52.010" end="01:04:00.049" style="s2">we&#39;re dominated by these sort of you</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.400" end="01:04:02.450" style="s2">know language forms which which</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.049" end="01:04:05.240" style="s2">hypnotize our minds in some kind of way</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.450" end="01:04:08.119" style="s2">to actually get heart attacks are</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.240" end="01:04:10.789" style="s2">against their own better nature yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.119" end="01:04:13.250" style="s2">they limit and and focus and direct our</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.789" end="01:04:15.589" style="s2">attention in certain ways that while</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.250" end="01:04:18.230" style="s2">they might be useful in some contexts</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.589" end="01:04:20.780" style="s2">are devastating in others and we have no</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.230" end="01:04:22.910" style="s2">sense we&#39;re not trained yet and we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.780" end="01:04:25.309" style="s2">learn and train each other to be this</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.910" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">way so there&#39;s an opportunity and this</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.309" end="01:04:29.869" style="s2">is something that I&#39;m very involved with</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:34.520" style="s2">and care about but yeah language is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.869" end="01:04:36.549" style="s2">first fatally dangerous technology right</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.520" end="01:04:41.900" style="s2">and all of the other similar things</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.549" end="01:04:44.950" style="s2">emerge in its shadow we need to be in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.900" end="01:04:47.390" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s crucial that we become</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.950" end="01:04:49.910" style="s2">extremely intelligent and that we learn</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.390" end="01:04:51.380" style="s2">and teach each other how to understand</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.910" end="01:04:56.930" style="s2">our relationships with language and</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.380" end="01:05:00.230" style="s2">concepts and how to not be crippled by</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.930" end="01:05:03.140" style="s2">those relationships how to both avoid</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.230" end="01:05:05.539" style="s2">the dangers and become and help each</p>

<p begin="01:05:05.539" end="01:05:08.990" style="s2">opportunities because like like all</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.670" end="01:05:11.089" style="s2">technologies where I&#39;m gonna get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.990" end="01:05:12.140" style="s2">them right we can&#39;t we can&#39;t just go</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.089" end="01:05:16.960" style="s2">around saying like well language is</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.140" end="01:05:19.369" style="s2">really dangerous yeah yeah then what I</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.960" end="01:05:23.079" style="s2">want I wanna there&#39;s there was an</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.369" end="01:05:25.309" style="s2">article by Jonathan green wall where he</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.079" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">distinguishes between what he calls the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.309" end="01:05:30.349" style="s2">the red religion in the blue church</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:33.619" style="s2">right and the blue the blue church he</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.349" end="01:05:36.680" style="s2">describes as being you know the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.619" end="01:05:38.569" style="s2">broadcast model right where you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.680" end="01:05:42.020" style="s2">somebody is telling you something in</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.569" end="01:05:45.440" style="s2">your passively you know you&#39;re absorbing</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.020" end="01:05:47.539" style="s2">their message and this is how the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.440" end="01:05:48.650" style="s2">century has been working in terms of how</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.539" end="01:05:51.589" style="s2">to keep population</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.650" end="01:05:56.000" style="s2">you know you know you know under control</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.589" end="01:05:57.500" style="s2">etc and that that this this red religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:05:59.390" style="s2">model is where there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.500" end="01:06:00.859" style="s2">back-and-forth thing going on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.390" end="01:06:03.170" style="s2">much more chaotic and it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.859" end="01:06:05.289" style="s2">dangerous and it&#39;s it&#39;s more like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.170" end="01:06:07.640" style="s2">say it&#39;s more like YouTube then then</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.289" end="01:06:10.190" style="s2">public TV right there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.640" end="01:06:14.000" style="s2">people you know all kinds of messages</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.190" end="01:06:17.029" style="s2">are assaulting you all at once so we</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.000" end="01:06:21.410" style="s2">have these two different kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.029" end="01:06:24.710" style="s2">models and so so on one one side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.410" end="01:06:30.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s total chaos and the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.710" end="01:06:32.450" style="s2">side it&#39;s total order right how do we</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.279" end="01:06:35.029" style="s2">how do we have how do we create a</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.450" end="01:06:38.779" style="s2">balanced you know system how do we work</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.029" end="01:06:42.460" style="s2">with this contradictory aspects of our</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.779" end="01:06:50.869" style="s2">own nature even you know so again I</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.460" end="01:06:56.349" style="s2">notice the common tendency to speak very</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.869" end="01:06:59.359" style="s2">abstractly about broad generalized talks</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.349" end="01:07:02.589" style="s2">that&#39;s okay once again my recommendation</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.359" end="01:07:05.390" style="s2">about that is only that we recognize</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.589" end="01:07:09.160" style="s2">when we begin to make such move and by</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.390" end="01:07:09.160" style="s2">we I actually mean you need right now</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.250" end="01:07:17.869" style="s2">and this one word we is is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.529" end="01:07:20.150" style="s2">word we need but it&#39;s important to pay a</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.869" end="01:07:22.520" style="s2">great deal of attention to how it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.150" end="01:07:25.970" style="s2">being used and to does it refer to an</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.520" end="01:07:28.250" style="s2">actual we that we intentionally formed</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.970" end="01:07:30.920" style="s2">together or does it refer to an abstract</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.250" end="01:07:33.740" style="s2">we and in your previous question</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.920" end="01:07:35.900" style="s2">it refers to an abstract we it refers to</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.740" end="01:07:37.430" style="s2">we engine us in general yeah well I was</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.900" end="01:07:40.099" style="s2">talking about I was talking about you</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.430" end="01:07:42.650" style="s2">know tendencies of culture I was sure no</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.099" end="01:07:44.270" style="s2">it&#39;s perfectly reasonable you said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.650" end="01:07:45.589" style="s2">not being critical about I&#39;m community</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.270" end="01:07:51.020" style="s2">recognized okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.589" end="01:07:53.210" style="s2">this is this mode right so we can still</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.020" end="01:07:55.430" style="s2">relate and talk and do everything we</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.210" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">want about that mode I just think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.430" end="01:07:58.990" style="s2">important to recognize when we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.720" end="01:08:00.579" style="s2">it and there&#39;s reasons why that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.990" end="01:08:11.050" style="s2">aren&#39;t particularly relevant right now</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.579" end="01:08:17.199" style="s2">so back to your question so what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.050" end="01:08:25.620" style="s2">present it is a model of the state of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.199" end="01:08:25.620" style="s2">our society and exposure to media and</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.580" end="01:08:38.560" style="s2">obviously each person makes decisions</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.380" end="01:08:42.640" style="s2">actively or passively about how they</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.560" end="01:08:44.440" style="s2">relate with that situation now if two</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:45.969" style="s2">people or more should come together like</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.440" end="01:08:48.489" style="s2">you and I here right now we actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.969" end="01:08:52.540" style="s2">have come together intentionally for a</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.489" end="01:08:56.080" style="s2">purpose and that is the formation of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.540" end="01:08:58.480" style="s2">real we right that&#39;s a factual weak that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.080" end="01:09:00.549" style="s2">we actually have done this we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.480" end="01:09:04.679" style="s2">chosen to come together we are here now</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.549" end="01:09:09.880" style="s2">in real time speaking and exploring and</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.679" end="01:09:12.520" style="s2">if that we wanted to approach the</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.880" end="01:09:14.920" style="s2">question would be very different from</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.520" end="01:09:18.940" style="s2">what we might imagine if we respond to</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.920" end="01:09:23.910" style="s2">the question of the generalized we so</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.940" end="01:09:28.210" style="s2">for example for myself I have a very</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.910" end="01:09:31.810" style="s2">thick buffer I have a buffer that</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.210" end="01:09:35.230" style="s2">protects me from news from nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.810" end="01:09:37.900" style="s2">I&#39;m extremely selective about what media</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.230" end="01:09:43.449" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to interact or relate with</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.900" end="01:09:48.040" style="s2">and why and that&#39;s what I would call the</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.449" end="01:09:52.859" style="s2">topic of media hygiene right how do we</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.040" end="01:09:56.440" style="s2">each do first of all do we even have any</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.859" end="01:09:59.350" style="s2">you what are the motivations that inform</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.440" end="01:10:01.350" style="s2">that so before we could answer a</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.350" end="01:10:04.570" style="s2">question as general as the one you posed</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.350" end="01:10:07.239" style="s2">we would need probably just to identify</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.570" end="01:10:11.510" style="s2">some motivations like what are our</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.239" end="01:10:13.929" style="s2">purposes in asking the question</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.510" end="01:10:16.309" style="s2">and one of the most amazing things about</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.929" end="01:10:21.619" style="s2">human beings in general and human beings</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.309" end="01:10:25.369" style="s2">in particular is both that purposes</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.619" end="01:10:29.630" style="s2">underlie how they relate with each other</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.369" end="01:10:33.380" style="s2">and with information and yet again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.630" end="01:10:39.230" style="s2">very rarely educated enough about this</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.380" end="01:10:43.280" style="s2">to either notice it clearly or to use it</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.230" end="01:10:46.280" style="s2">intelligently in our relationships with</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.280" end="01:10:49.130" style="s2">each other with the world with media so</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.280" end="01:10:51.320" style="s2">examining purposes and being aware of</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.130" end="01:10:54.159" style="s2">the purposes that underlie our questions</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.320" end="01:10:56.900" style="s2">and our desires and our fears is</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.159" end="01:10:59.389" style="s2">fundamental to forming an intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.900" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">answer and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.389" end="01:11:10.010" style="s2">crucial first move in any in any such</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:11.719" style="s2">style well most of the most people well</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.010" end="01:11:15.380" style="s2">here here are making a vested</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.719" end="01:11:17.719" style="s2">generalization but a common one I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.380" end="01:11:19.960" style="s2">most people just watch media they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.719" end="01:11:22.760" style="s2">have media hygiene it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.960" end="01:11:23.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s whatever interests</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.760" end="01:11:28.070" style="s2">you it&#39;s whatever catches your attention</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.960" end="01:11:29.780" style="s2">and so so you you know and then and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.070" end="01:11:33.219" style="s2">think I often consume media in that way</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.780" end="01:11:36.880" style="s2">I go from thing to finger thing and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.219" end="01:11:42.139" style="s2">click on ons on stuff that seems kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.880" end="01:11:45.920" style="s2">attractive or you know even you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.139" end="01:11:48.769" style="s2">even horrible or whatever it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.920" end="01:11:53.750" style="s2">it&#39;s some kind of you know it&#39;s like in</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.769" end="01:11:57.349" style="s2">a kind of low-level addiction that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.750" end="01:12:01.010" style="s2">almost most of the population has this</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.349" end="01:12:03.619" style="s2">right yes and maybe that&#39;s because they</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.010" end="01:12:06.920" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a substitute for cigarettes</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.619" end="01:12:09.110" style="s2">or or some other kind of addiction that</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.920" end="01:12:12.079" style="s2">people need to kind of survive in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.110" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">sense in a world that you know makes all</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.079" end="01:12:17.110" style="s2">these demands on them and stresses I you</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:20.269" style="s2">know they have to go to work every day</p>

<p begin="01:12:27.650" end="01:12:33.710" style="s2">talk about addiction for example it</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.750" end="01:12:35.920" style="s2">strikes me that most addiction emerges</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.710" end="01:12:39.590" style="s2">from precisely what I just said and</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.920" end="01:12:43.160" style="s2">perhaps most fundamentally from our</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.590" end="01:12:45.260" style="s2">having been divided from the prodigy and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.160" end="01:12:47.600" style="s2">genius that were our natural human</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.260" end="01:12:51.100" style="s2">inheritance that we brought to birth</p>

<p begin="01:13:04.219" end="01:13:10.070" style="s2">does not just society but um this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.150" end="01:13:13.070" style="s2">complex and goes back to my concerns</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.070" end="01:13:16.030" style="s2">about language it&#39;s my perspective that</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.070" end="01:13:22.670" style="s2">in childhood we actually undergo a</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.030" end="01:13:26.150" style="s2">crisis that is rape like during our</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.670" end="01:13:28.790" style="s2">exposure to language and concepts and it</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.150" end="01:13:30.800" style="s2">happens of course it begins in early</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.790" end="01:13:33.650" style="s2">childhood as we begin to acquire</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.800" end="01:13:36.290" style="s2">language but the primary window of this</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.650" end="01:13:40.660" style="s2">for most children is between 3 and 1/2</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.290" end="01:13:45.290" style="s2">and 7 with the beginning of the window</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.660" end="01:13:50.020" style="s2">usually comprising the very challenging</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.290" end="01:13:55.580" style="s2">aspect of this crisis and without</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.020" end="01:13:59.120" style="s2">wanting to introduce religious topics I</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.580" end="01:14:03.620" style="s2">can&#39;t help but notice in the Bible the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.120" end="01:14:07.760" style="s2">story of Cain and Abel where Cain kills</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.620" end="01:14:10.160" style="s2">Abel and essentially exiles him to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:12.260" style="s2">underworld which we could understand as</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.160" end="01:14:15.560" style="s2">what happens when we fall asleep right</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.260" end="01:14:18.260" style="s2">dreaming something like this process</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.560" end="01:14:21.530" style="s2">actually happens in each human life in</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.260" end="01:14:24.170" style="s2">our childhood and a dominating yeah</p>

<p begin="01:14:24.170" end="01:14:31.160" style="s2">established over our humanity and our</p>

<p begin="01:14:42.850" end="01:14:53.780" style="s2">reinstated I think is crucially</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.370" end="01:14:56.240" style="s2">important for us to become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.780" end="01:14:58.070" style="s2">together and to work with now not</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.770" end="01:15:13.400" style="s2">I am interested in prophetic</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.210" end="01:15:15.530" style="s2">perspectives from my own experience and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.400" end="01:15:17.930" style="s2">understanding what you say makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.530" end="01:15:23.180" style="s2">to me I want to just throw something out</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.930" end="01:15:27.680" style="s2">there and see how you like not exactly a</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.180" end="01:15:30.290" style="s2">criticism but nature right you know when</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.680" end="01:15:34.240" style="s2">I was in northern Canada I live in</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.290" end="01:15:37.310" style="s2">France now I I listen to the baby seals</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.240" end="01:15:39.860" style="s2">you know the mother seals would push the</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.310" end="01:15:41.540" style="s2">baby seals off onto the ice because they</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.860" end="01:15:45.020" style="s2">couldn&#39;t feed them right and you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.540" end="01:15:47.840" style="s2">hear the the baby seals you know making</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.020" end="01:15:53.920" style="s2">this noise you know and I can project</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.840" end="01:15:58.820" style="s2">human emotions on that or or or you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.920" end="01:16:02.350" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is is you know you speak</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.820" end="01:16:05.320" style="s2">of nature as this wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.350" end="01:16:08.180" style="s2">extraordinary thing but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.320" end="01:16:11.900" style="s2">equally terrible is it not at much of</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.180" end="01:16:13.820" style="s2">the environmental kind of dialogue seems</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.900" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">to be to say oh yeah human beings are</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.820" end="01:16:18.770" style="s2">thus cancer on the earth and and and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:22.130" style="s2">nature itself is pure we have this sort</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.770" end="01:16:24.410" style="s2">of extremely demonic quality and we also</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.130" end="01:16:27.170" style="s2">have this dream the exilic quality at</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.410" end="01:16:29.720" style="s2">the same time it seems to me there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.170" end="01:16:32.060" style="s2">photographer name escapes me at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.720" end="01:16:35.120" style="s2">moment who&#39;s very famous for</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.060" end="01:16:37.790" style="s2">photographing her own children and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.120" end="01:16:38.540" style="s2">fairly clear that they live out in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.790" end="01:16:41.980" style="s2">wilderness</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.540" end="01:16:46.370" style="s2">probably in a swamp and her children</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.980" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">just look like animals yeah and she</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.370" end="01:16:50.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any of the questions or</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:51.950" style="s2">concerns that you&#39;re raising because</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.570" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">they have no</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.950" end="01:16:57.980" style="s2">existence in the context in which she</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:17:00.890" style="s2">has chosen to raise her children and in</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.980" end="01:17:03.740" style="s2">the way that she&#39;s chosen to raised so</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.890" end="01:17:05.330" style="s2">you can see this like incredible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.740" end="01:17:10.220" style="s2">one of the reasons why why she&#39;s famous</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.330" end="01:17:13.610" style="s2">and very provocative you can see this</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.220" end="01:17:15.620" style="s2">like totally feral her children are</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.610" end="01:17:18.110" style="s2">little animals they&#39;re just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.620" end="01:17:18.920" style="s2">human animals in the wilderness being</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.110" end="01:17:24.560" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.920" end="01:17:27.800" style="s2">dirty endangered by by the environment</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.560" end="01:17:29.270" style="s2">to just being you know human animals and</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.800" end="01:17:33.410" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s beautiful and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.270" end="01:17:39.370" style="s2">haunting and it&#39;s evocative right so she</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.410" end="01:17:43.580" style="s2">selected a context and also selected</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.370" end="01:17:47.690" style="s2">modes of relation with the world culture</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.580" end="01:17:51.350" style="s2">her children education health care all</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.690" end="01:17:54.290" style="s2">these things those selections formed a</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.350" end="01:17:57.500" style="s2">context in the same way that those</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.290" end="01:17:59.780" style="s2">selections you make form a context in</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.500" end="01:18:05.090" style="s2">the same way the selections I made form</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.780" end="01:18:11.030" style="s2">the context or affected the upbringing</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.090" end="01:18:13.850" style="s2">of my child so the first part of my</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.030" end="01:18:20.930" style="s2">answer is just context is going to</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.850" end="01:18:24.350" style="s2">dictate a lot of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.930" end="01:18:27.530" style="s2">variables and then within those we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.350" end="01:18:35.840" style="s2">going to make both passive and active</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.530" end="01:18:41.540" style="s2">choices about how we how and if we crush</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.840" end="01:18:44.630" style="s2">our children&#39;s innate prodigy how and if</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.540" end="01:18:48.950" style="s2">we recognize it how and if we support it</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.630" end="01:18:50.660" style="s2">how and if we reshape it well on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.950" end="01:18:52.430" style="s2">other hand I don&#39;t find your image of</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.660" end="01:18:54.860" style="s2">this person you know these wild feral</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.430" end="01:18:56.840" style="s2">children attractive you know the word</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.860" end="01:18:58.550" style="s2">paradise means walled garden there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.840" end="01:19:00.260" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of protection right</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.550" end="01:19:02.470" style="s2">you&#39;re not just you&#39;re not just at the</p>

<p begin="01:19:02.470" end="01:19:13.030" style="s2">yes but of course it&#39;s not clear whether</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.810" end="01:19:15.880" style="s2">the wall is physical or relational it</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.030" end="01:19:23.170" style="s2">occurs to me that the photographer in</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.880" end="01:19:27.340" style="s2">question certainly takes careful care of</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.170" end="01:19:31.900" style="s2">her children and that there are some</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.340" end="01:19:33.820" style="s2">kinds of priests and of course I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.900" end="01:19:35.770" style="s2">presenting my idealized perspective</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.820" end="01:19:38.620" style="s2">based on exposure to her work I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.770" end="01:19:41.590" style="s2">really know deeply about her story or</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.620" end="01:19:44.770" style="s2">her children but it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.590" end="01:19:46.770" style="s2">exception to what we more commonly see</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.770" end="01:19:50.530" style="s2">and expect and that&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.770" end="01:19:54.330" style="s2">intrigues me about it it shows us like</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.530" end="01:19:59.440" style="s2">wow in a different context humans can be</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.330" end="01:20:04.170" style="s2">entirely unlike what they imagined they</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.440" end="01:20:06.940" style="s2">are inside cities and you know civilized</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.170" end="01:20:11.290" style="s2">contexts so that&#39;s that&#39;s what I find</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.940" end="01:20:12.820" style="s2">interesting about it there&#39;s naturally a</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.290" end="01:20:14.490" style="s2">pragmatic constraint concern for our</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.820" end="01:20:18.580" style="s2">children&#39;s safety right that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.490" end="01:20:20.830" style="s2">about saying and that&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.580" end="01:20:24.130" style="s2">concern the question is how do we</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.830" end="01:20:25.840" style="s2">negotiate intelligently between the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.130" end="01:20:27.550" style="s2">threats and dangers that we perceive and</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.840" end="01:20:30.070" style="s2">the purposes for which we go looking for</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.550" end="01:20:35.040" style="s2">them very important feature we usually</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.070" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">overlooked and our children&#39;s innate</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.040" end="01:20:49.060" style="s2">gifts and prodigy and creative potential</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:53.470" style="s2">to exist both within you know culture</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.060" end="01:20:55.510" style="s2">and society and beyond outside as well</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.470" end="01:20:58.450" style="s2">to rip to to to let them have both</p>

<p begin="01:21:08.520" end="01:21:14.710" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s really hard for</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.030" end="01:21:17.380" style="s2">individuals to accomplish it on their</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.710" end="01:21:20.350" style="s2">own with no you know outside of any</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.380" end="01:21:21.400" style="s2">context that&#39;s supportive of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.350" end="01:21:25.570" style="s2">pretty tough I think it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.400" end="01:21:29.640" style="s2">challenging some parents manage it they</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.570" end="01:21:34.150" style="s2">are in the minority by far it seems yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.640" end="01:21:38.440" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of fading here Darren&#39;s okay my</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.150" end="01:21:41.650" style="s2">brain is getting a little happy</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.440" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">to have a future conversation I saw what</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.650" end="01:21:45.730" style="s2">we were doing today in my imagination</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:48.340" style="s2">anyway primarily isn&#39;t it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.730" end="01:21:50.670" style="s2">experiment right so like yeah we&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.340" end="01:21:53.800" style="s2">this and see how things work and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.670" end="01:21:58.090" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll do something more you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.800" end="01:21:59.830" style="s2">more formatted more formal if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.090" end="01:22:03.580" style="s2">agreeable is that something you want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.830" end="01:22:08.040" style="s2">do it&#39;s my perspective that the nature</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.580" end="01:22:10.900" style="s2">of our humanity is mostly hidden from us</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.040" end="01:22:13.840" style="s2">we are commonly exposed to something</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.900" end="01:22:16.920" style="s2">like one or two percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.840" end="01:22:21.150" style="s2">potentials and intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.920" end="01:22:24.040" style="s2">relationships that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.150" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">emerging from right it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.040" end="01:22:28.810" style="s2">we have a relationship with them we</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">originate in these and most of us is</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.810" end="01:22:34.060" style="s2">invisible to us and and the primary</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:35.770" style="s2">things that make that invisible are our</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.060" end="01:22:41.260" style="s2">relationships with language knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.770" end="01:22:45.880" style="s2">Authority society culture and the lack</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.260" end="01:22:49.300" style="s2">of relationships that encourage us to</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.880" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">explore and rediscover and recover these</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.300" end="01:22:54.420" style="s2">aspects of our humanity so these are</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:59.260" style="s2">passionate interests that I have and</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.420" end="01:23:02.620" style="s2">while I&#39;m very capable of forming</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.260" end="01:23:05.350" style="s2">incisive critical statements about what</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.620" end="01:23:07.450" style="s2">we&#39;re subjected to societies we live in</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.350" end="01:23:08.530" style="s2">the dangers associated with them in</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.450" end="01:23:11.250" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.530" end="01:23:13.780" style="s2">I&#39;m also very creatively and</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.250" end="01:23:17.910" style="s2">optimistically engaged with flipping</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.780" end="01:23:20.310" style="s2">that over I once we can see what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.910" end="01:23:22.920" style="s2">right kind of perspective we can usually</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.310" end="01:23:24.900" style="s2">together if we agree to invert it and</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.920" end="01:23:27.240" style="s2">play a different game together and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.900" end="01:23:28.620" style="s2">that&#39;s my fundamental passionate</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.240" end="01:23:31.410" style="s2">interest is playing a different game</p>
