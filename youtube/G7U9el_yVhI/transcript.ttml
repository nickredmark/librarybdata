<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.110" style="s2">what happened so now we&#39;ve got to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.770" end="00:00:06.210" style="s2">point where the story says while human</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.110" end="00:00:08.309" style="s2">beings became self-conscious and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.210" end="00:00:10.920" style="s2">here&#39;s the problem with that the problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">is is that we&#39;re terribly self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.920" end="00:00:15.299" style="s2">about our inadequacies and our</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:17.699" style="s2">vulnerabilities and that that sets up</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.299" end="00:00:20.039" style="s2">enmity between men and women and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.699" end="00:00:21.810" style="s2">dooms women to pain in childbirth and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.039" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">child-rearing and it dooms men to work</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.810" end="00:00:27.269" style="s2">it&#39;s a big problem okay so now the next</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">story that comes up in the sequence is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.269" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">the story of Cain and Abel now you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.449" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">we talked about the dragon of chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:39.390" style="s2">then the terrible mother and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:41.250" style="s2">creative mother and on the tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.390" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">father and the secure father and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.250" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">the adversary and the hero Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">are the first manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">adversary and the hero and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">is they emerge as soon as the genesis in</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">the original Genesis story ends so what</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">the story basically proposes is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">once people became self conscious two</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">modes of being emerged as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">of that and one mode is represented by</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.130" style="s2">Cain and the other mode is represented</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:09.990" style="s2">by Abel and that&#39;s echoed in the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.130" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">of the hostile brothers in stories of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">hostile brothers everywhere but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">also paralleled in Christianity by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">idea of the relationship between Christ</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">and Satan so it&#39;s like Cain and Abel are</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:24.409" style="s2">precursors to the idea of Christ and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">and and Satan now what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.409" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">Cain is the older brother and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">him sort of the embodiment of tradition</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">he would also be the favored one in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:36.090" style="s2">terms of the traditions of the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">Israelites because he would be the one</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.090" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">that inherits everyone so everything so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">he&#39;s actually the one that&#39;s he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">the embodiment of tradition and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">some add some advantages to that because</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">he&#39;s privileged because of it but</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:50.310" style="s2">there&#39;s some disadvantages because to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:52.310" style="s2">the degree that culture itself has</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">become sterile and inappropriate and he</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.310" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">manifests that that means that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:01:59.790" style="s2">manifests error by merely being what he</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:05.000" style="s2">was now what happens with an enable is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:05.000" style="s2">the young is the young brother so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.510" end="00:02:14.569" style="s2">Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.130" end="00:02:16.810" style="s2">a tiller of the ground</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.569" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.810" end="00:02:21.470" style="s2">dichotomy of professions here and people</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:22.819" style="s2">have read that in all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.470" end="00:02:25.220" style="s2">ways but one of the ways that you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.819" end="00:02:26.739" style="s2">think about it is that there are valid</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.220" end="00:02:29.930" style="s2">different modes of being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.739" end="00:02:32.360" style="s2">you know so you can be in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.930" end="00:02:34.190" style="s2">you can be a tiller of the ground or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.360" end="00:02:35.750" style="s2">keeper of animals but in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.190" end="00:02:38.180" style="s2">general you can adopt any number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.750" end="00:02:40.819" style="s2">rules that suffice you can be a plumber</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.180" end="00:02:43.340" style="s2">or you can be a lawyer and there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.819" end="00:02:46.040" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s ways of acting within</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.340" end="00:02:47.959" style="s2">those rules that transcend the rules</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.040" end="00:02:50.769" style="s2">themselves and so that&#39;s part of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.959" end="00:02:52.970" style="s2">being exemplified in Cain and Abel so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.769" end="00:02:55.340" style="s2">they can they can function in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.970" end="00:02:57.980" style="s2">despite their different their different</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.340" end="00:02:59.750" style="s2">roles in process of time it came to pass</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.980" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">that Cain brought of the fruit of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.750" end="00:03:03.769" style="s2">ground an offering unto the Lord and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:06.349" style="s2">Abel he also brought of the firstlings</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.769" end="00:03:08.030" style="s2">of his flock and of the fat thereof now</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.349" end="00:03:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s very archaic the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.030" end="00:03:12.140" style="s2">sacrifice okay so basically what happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.160" end="00:03:14.780" style="s2">is that you&#39;re trying to get God on your</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.140" end="00:03:17.000" style="s2">side and so God seems to want something</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.780" end="00:03:18.920" style="s2">from you because he keeps demanding this</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.000" end="00:03:20.690" style="s2">and that so you might say well reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.920" end="00:03:22.070" style="s2">wants something from you it wants you to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.690" end="00:03:23.810" style="s2">behave in a certain way so that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.070" end="00:03:25.820" style="s2">don&#39;t suffer any more than you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.810" end="00:03:27.530" style="s2">and so that things go well for you now</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.820" end="00:03:28.970" style="s2">human beings at this point in time are</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.530" end="00:03:30.859" style="s2">trying to work out exactly what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.970" end="00:03:31.820" style="s2">means and they&#39;ve already got to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.859" end="00:03:33.620" style="s2">point where they&#39;re conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.820" end="00:03:35.350" style="s2">sophisticated enough to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.620" end="00:03:38.569" style="s2">that means that sacrifices are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.350" end="00:03:40.100" style="s2">now you remember that it&#39;s only prior to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.569" end="00:03:41.900" style="s2">this that human beings discover time</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.100" end="00:03:43.670" style="s2">itself right that&#39;s when they discovered</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.900" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">that they&#39;re they become self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.670" end="00:03:47.720" style="s2">and discover their extension across time</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">and so one of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:51.410" style="s2">realizing that your extended across time</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:54.230" style="s2">is that you also will come to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.410" end="00:03:56.600" style="s2">realization that you may have to let go</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.230" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">of certain valuable things right now in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.600" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">order to make things work better in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:01.639" style="s2">future and you can&#39;t imagine that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:04.790" style="s2">just woke up and figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.639" end="00:04:06.829" style="s2">I cook people god only knows how long to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.790" end="00:04:08.260" style="s2">sort that out it&#39;s tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.829" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">years to come up with that realization</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.260" end="00:04:12.859" style="s2">first of all they would have acted it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.340" end="00:04:13.910" style="s2">out like bees do you know they collect</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.859" end="00:04:14.989" style="s2">honey and they make it through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.910" end="00:04:16.549" style="s2">winter but they don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.989" end="00:04:18.290" style="s2">they&#39;re doing or maybe they do maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.549" end="00:04:20.510" style="s2">they&#39;re little supercomputers like these</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.290" end="00:04:21.079" style="s2">bloody atoms but you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.510" end="00:04:22.849" style="s2">you can out</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.079" end="00:04:24.830" style="s2">this sort of thing out without realizing</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.849" end="00:04:26.750" style="s2">what you&#39;re up to and the motif of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.830" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">sacrifice seemed to be exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.750" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">people stumbled on to the dramatic idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.270" end="00:04:33.110" style="s2">that if you gave up something of value</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:35.539" style="s2">there would be some reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.110" end="00:04:37.939" style="s2">possibility that God would smile on you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.539" end="00:04:40.280" style="s2">in the future okay so so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.939" end="00:04:41.629" style="s2">there&#39;s the sacrifices now you might say</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.280" end="00:04:43.580" style="s2">well why did they burn them and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.629" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">reason for that is well as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.580" end="00:04:48.650" style="s2">tell people are trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:50.319" style="s2">what the ultimate fabric of existence is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.650" end="00:04:52.520" style="s2">and I think that you can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.319" end="00:04:54.349" style="s2">sometimes in one of the places that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.520" end="00:04:56.270" style="s2">people feel that regularly is when</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.349" end="00:04:58.099" style="s2">they&#39;re out at night and they look up at</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.270" end="00:05:00.409" style="s2">the sky and they see this immense</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.099" end="00:05:03.349" style="s2">blanket of eternity that&#39;s laid out</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.409" end="00:05:05.900" style="s2">before them and that induces a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.349" end="00:05:09.349" style="s2">of awe and I think that that archaic</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.900" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">people took the notion of that awe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.349" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">was a consequence of this apprehension</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">and associated that with some something</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:18.020" style="s2">like communion with the divine which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:19.699" style="s2">actually quite reasonable because when</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.020" end="00:05:21.349" style="s2">you are looking out into space you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.699" end="00:05:24.379" style="s2">looking into the farthest reaches of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.349" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">being you can see back millions hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.379" end="00:05:28.779" style="s2">of millions of years back into time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:31.340" style="s2">you see you gaze out into the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.779" end="00:05:33.860" style="s2">expanses of being so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.340" end="00:05:35.539" style="s2">unreasonable to assume that in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.860" end="00:05:37.339" style="s2">sense at that moment you have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.539" end="00:05:39.020" style="s2">connection with what&#39;s infinite whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.339" end="00:05:41.270" style="s2">that happens to be and I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.020" end="00:05:43.339" style="s2">feel that rather than thinking so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.270" end="00:05:45.139" style="s2">anyways the idea basically emerged that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.339" end="00:05:46.879" style="s2">the divine was up in the sky and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.139" end="00:05:48.860" style="s2">because the divine was up in the sky you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.879" end="00:05:50.719" style="s2">could maybe communicate it with it by</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.860" end="00:05:52.190" style="s2">sending messages up there and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.719" end="00:05:54.710" style="s2">ways you could do that was with smoke</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.190" end="00:05:56.509" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re burning these things</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.710" end="00:05:58.129" style="s2">that you&#39;re offering you get to push the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.509" end="00:06:00.710" style="s2">smoke up to God and he can do a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.129" end="00:06:02.270" style="s2">molecular analysis and see if what</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.710" end="00:06:04.430" style="s2">you&#39;re offering is of any reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.270" end="00:06:05.719" style="s2">quality and if it seems to me then poof</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.430" end="00:06:06.050" style="s2">you know God&#39;s gonna be thrilled about</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.719" end="00:06:08.539" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.050" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">or maybe he&#39;s not now what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.539" end="00:06:15.110" style="s2">that Cain&#39;s offerings are rejected and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:18.199" style="s2">Abel&#39;s offerings are accepted and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.110" end="00:06:20.089" style="s2">what that means is that Cain gets the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.199" end="00:06:22.250" style="s2">short end of the stick and Abel gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.089" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">everything good happening to him so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.250" end="00:06:26.990" style="s2">you see happening is that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:28.550" style="s2">notion of two paths of being one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.990" end="00:06:30.500" style="s2">favored and one that isn&#39;t favored now</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.550" end="00:06:33.949" style="s2">the story is very ambivalent about why</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.500" end="00:06:34.340" style="s2">Cain is not favored and Abel is and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.949" end="00:06:36.230" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.340" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">can you can read it multiple ways you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.230" end="00:06:39.470" style="s2">can just say well guards basically being</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:40.940" style="s2">a son of a and he&#39;s not gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.470" end="00:06:43.460" style="s2">Katie anything just because he&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.940" end="00:06:44.990" style="s2">a very good mood that day or you can say</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.460" end="00:06:47.180" style="s2">well Abel&#39;s doing something right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.990" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">Cain isn&#39;t and I think that interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.180" end="00:06:51.320" style="s2">the story in either of those ways this</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.770" end="00:06:52.790" style="s2">is perfectly illuminating because part</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.320" end="00:06:54.380" style="s2">of the time in life it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.790" end="00:06:56.510" style="s2">someone&#39;s doing everything right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.380" end="00:06:59.210" style="s2">still they&#39;re just getting laid waste</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.510" end="00:07:00.650" style="s2">left right and center and someone else</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.210" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">is doing something terribly and things</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.650" end="00:07:04.790" style="s2">are going well for them and but then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:07.100" style="s2">also see the reverse where someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.790" end="00:07:09.800" style="s2">doing well gets rewarded and someone who</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.100" end="00:07:11.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t so there&#39;s an ambivalence</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.800" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">about it now I think the story does</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.630" end="00:07:15.200" style="s2">indicate that Cain is doing something</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:18.550" style="s2">wrong but it it doesn&#39;t do that until</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.200" end="00:07:18.550" style="s2">later so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.780" end="00:07:33.910" style="s2">sorry let me just go down to the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.009" end="00:07:33.910" style="s2">section here</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:45.629" style="s2">so what it can enable sacrifice in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.099" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">biblical version cited here the nature</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.629" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">of Cain sacrifices left unclear except</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:51.690" style="s2">that it is of the ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:54.180" style="s2">it&#39;s vegetative and therefore bloodless</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.690" end="00:07:55.830" style="s2">every canonical tale however carries</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.180" end="00:07:57.449" style="s2">with it a surrounding cloud of similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.830" end="00:07:58.710" style="s2">stories some derivatives some the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.449" end="00:08:00.810" style="s2">product of a different developmental</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.710" end="00:08:03.000" style="s2">path and tradition some intermingled</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.810" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">with other stories in some variants Cain</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.000" end="00:08:08.009" style="s2">sacrifices not only of the ground but</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:09.810" style="s2">it&#39;s of low quality Cain is unwilling to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.009" end="00:08:12.090" style="s2">offer up the finest fruits of his</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.810" end="00:08:14.099" style="s2">Labor&#39;s to God thus he does not really</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.090" end="00:08:16.289" style="s2">sacrifice anything he wants to keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.099" end="00:08:18.659" style="s2">everything good to himself so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.289" end="00:08:20.520" style="s2">selfish as well as faithless Abel by</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.659" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">contrast offers up the best of what he</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.520" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">has what does this mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:27.090" style="s2">once again we already know we say to our</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">children do your best do not hide your</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.090" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">light under a bushel we do not say</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">conserve your best or hide your best we</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:36.089" style="s2">mean offer the best you have do it in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:38.010" style="s2">good faith you will not be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.089" end="00:08:39.779" style="s2">assured of success but your chances will</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.010" end="00:08:42.300" style="s2">begin to increase to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.779" end="00:08:43.890" style="s2">such increase is possible certainly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">no overstatement to say that if you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.890" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">not believe this you at least wish with</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:49.290" style="s2">all your heart that it was true this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">hope to not believe this is to risk</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.290" end="00:08:54.450" style="s2">descent into the deepest chasms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">cynicism so what happens God accepts</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">Abel&#39;s sacrifice offers him respect and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.329" style="s2">renders his life acceptable despite its</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">terrible limitations Cain&#39;s sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.329" end="00:09:06.300" style="s2">however he rejects this drives Cain into</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:08.010" style="s2">a murderous rage rage so the Lord God</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.300" end="00:09:10.500" style="s2">had respect unto Abel and his offering</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.010" end="00:09:11.520" style="s2">but unto Cain and his offering he did</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.500" end="00:09:14.279" style="s2">not have respect</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.520" end="00:09:16.950" style="s2">so the idea basically is that Abel makes</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.279" end="00:09:20.040" style="s2">these sacrifices he&#39;s putting forth the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.950" end="00:09:21.540" style="s2">best that he has he&#39;s doing his best and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.040" end="00:09:24.060" style="s2">because of that it&#39;s actually working</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.540" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">everyone likes Abel you know he has he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.060" end="00:09:27.899" style="s2">getting along with his wives his flocks</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:29.910" style="s2">are increasing he&#39;s a good guy it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.899" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">everything&#39;s going well whereas Cain</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.910" end="00:09:33.779" style="s2">things aren&#39;t going very well at all and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:35.610" style="s2">no one really cares for him and besides</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.779" end="00:09:37.500" style="s2">that he&#39;s burning with jealousy because</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.610" end="00:09:39.209" style="s2">you know despite the fact that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.500" end="00:09:40.829" style="s2">slaving away raising all these</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.209" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">vegetables and trying to offer them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.829" end="00:09:45.329" style="s2">God nothing is going his way</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">so not only are things going badly for</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.329" end="00:09:51.810" style="s2">him but he&#39;s increasingly disaffected by</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:53.820" style="s2">it and you know you it&#39;s not difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.810" end="00:09:54.780" style="s2">to understand that you know perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.820" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">well that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.780" end="00:09:57.810" style="s2">what happens to you if you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:09:59.700" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.810" end="00:10:01.650" style="s2">you think diligently and properly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.700" end="00:10:03.510" style="s2">nothing is going your way and some other</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.650" end="00:10:05.820" style="s2">son of a is just flourishing like</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.510" end="00:10:08.760" style="s2">mad beside you that that&#39;s going to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.820" end="00:10:11.370" style="s2">you vengeful and and irritated and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.760" end="00:10:12.630" style="s2">anxious and angry and and homicidal for</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.370" end="00:10:14.760" style="s2">that matter and it doesn&#39;t take very</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.630" end="00:10:16.920" style="s2">long before people reach that stage at</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.760" end="00:10:19.560" style="s2">least not in their fantasies now the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.920" end="00:10:21.540" style="s2">story says and Cain was very wroth and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.560" end="00:10:24.030" style="s2">his countenance fell and what that meant</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.540" end="00:10:26.460" style="s2">is he&#39;s angry and his face changes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.030" end="00:10:28.830" style="s2">indicate that so he&#39;s got this continual</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.460" end="00:10:30.780" style="s2">look of perpetual dis effect Asian and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.830" end="00:10:33.750" style="s2">anger on his face because things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.780" end="00:10:35.580" style="s2">going well for him so that&#39;s fine so</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.750" end="00:10:37.290" style="s2">then he goes and has a chat with God</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.580" end="00:10:38.940" style="s2">because he&#39;s not very happy about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.290" end="00:10:40.890" style="s2">whole situation and I think people do</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.940" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">that all the time too even if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.890" end="00:10:44.940" style="s2">necessarily formulate it in those terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re thinking well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.940" end="00:10:48.780" style="s2">the nature of reality I&#39;m busting myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">in half here trying to make things work</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.780" end="00:10:52.080" style="s2">properly and nothing&#39;s going well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:54.420" style="s2">like what kind of stupid universe is</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.080" end="00:10:57.240" style="s2">that and for all intents and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.420" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a cola coy with God because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.240" end="00:11:00.810" style="s2">don&#39;t start thinking about the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:03.180" style="s2">fabric of reality without bringing</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.810" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">religious intuitions into it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.180" end="00:11:08.280" style="s2">even ask such a question without acting</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:09.810" style="s2">in a quasi religious manner so this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.280" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">what happens it took me a long time to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.810" end="00:11:14.820" style="s2">unpack this so he goes and has the chat</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:16.770" style="s2">chat with yahwah with God and the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.820" end="00:11:19.530" style="s2">said to Cain why are you angry and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.770" end="00:11:21.780" style="s2">downcast surely if you do right</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.530" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">you ought to hold your head high sin</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.780" end="00:11:28.170" style="s2">crouches out your door lusting for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:30.450" style="s2">yet you can master it now that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.170" end="00:11:32.130" style="s2">very interesting so I translated those I</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.450" end="00:11:35.550" style="s2">got a translation to those lines from a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">guy named Miles from 1995 now it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.550" end="00:11:39.270" style="s2">what happens is that Cain goes and has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:40.860" style="s2">chat with God about how things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.270" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">going very well and basically what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.860" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">trying to do is hold God to account for</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:46.890" style="s2">why he made such a stupid universe where</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:49.800" style="s2">everything keeps going wrong and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.890" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">God says to him is why are you angry and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.800" end="00:11:54.960" style="s2">downcast if you do right you ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.490" style="s2">able to hold your head high so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.960" end="00:11:58.110" style="s2">an intimation there that the reason the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.490" end="00:11:59.910" style="s2">Cain is warned around like this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.110" end="00:12:02.310" style="s2">because there&#39;s actually something he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.910" end="00:12:04.170" style="s2">doing that&#39;s not correct it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.310" end="00:12:06.150" style="s2">the structure of reality&#39;s got a problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.170" end="00:12:08.350" style="s2">it&#39;s that Cain has a problem and God</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.150" end="00:12:09.940" style="s2">says well if you just do things proper</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.350" end="00:12:11.320" style="s2">then you could stand up you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.940" end="00:12:13.330" style="s2">have to be a defeated lobster all</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.320" end="00:12:15.970" style="s2">hunched over and aggravated you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.330" end="00:12:21.460" style="s2">stand up and you know hold yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.970" end="00:12:23.110" style="s2">properly and be be thoroughly integrated</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.460" end="00:12:25.180" style="s2">in a proper manner with the way being is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.110" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">unfolding and then he says sin crutches</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.180" end="00:12:28.960" style="s2">at your door lusting for you yet you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:35.100" style="s2">master it now that&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.960" end="00:12:38.730" style="s2">line so I found out that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.100" end="00:12:40.840" style="s2">there&#39;s an under there&#39;s a metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.730" end="00:12:42.850" style="s2">context within which those lines are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.840" end="00:12:45.970" style="s2">uttered and here&#39;s the context so God</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.850" end="00:12:48.220" style="s2">basically tells Cain that sin which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.970" end="00:12:50.620" style="s2">misbehavior is a kind of personality and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.220" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">the personality that he associates it</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.620" end="00:12:55.930" style="s2">with is something like a sexually</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:57.580" style="s2">aroused predatory cat and he tells Cain</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.930" end="00:12:59.830" style="s2">that he&#39;s no Cain&#39;s in a house and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.580" end="00:13:01.990" style="s2">thing is crouching at the door and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.830" end="00:13:05.650" style="s2">waiting to jump on it and then he tells</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.990" end="00:13:07.570" style="s2">Cain that that&#39;s a real threat and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.650" end="00:13:09.160" style="s2">right there but he could he could not</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.570" end="00:13:10.690" style="s2">have that happen if he wanted and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.160" end="00:13:12.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.690" end="00:13:15.280" style="s2">inferences in there one inference is</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.550" end="00:13:16.630" style="s2">Cain invites it in now you remember you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.280" end="00:13:19.300" style="s2">may not remember you have to invite a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.630" end="00:13:20.890" style="s2">vampire into your house it can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.300" end="00:13:22.390" style="s2">come in of its own accord you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.890" end="00:13:24.370" style="s2">open the door and so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.390" end="00:13:26.680" style="s2">thing God tells Cain it&#39;s like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.370" end="00:13:29.050" style="s2">sure things aren&#39;t going very well but</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.680" end="00:13:31.090" style="s2">like that things at your door you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.050" end="00:13:32.920" style="s2">invited it in and you could master it if</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.090" end="00:13:34.810" style="s2">you want but you chose not to and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.920" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">the next thing that that the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.810" end="00:13:38.950" style="s2">conceptualization of the sin as this</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:41.590" style="s2">sort of angry and lustful calf there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.950" end="00:13:44.290" style="s2">sexual connotation to it and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.590" end="00:13:46.810" style="s2">thing pounces on Cain and has its way</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.290" end="00:13:49.690" style="s2">with him so there&#39;s an idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.810" end="00:13:52.390" style="s2">a like a quasi sexual interaction</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.690" end="00:13:54.640" style="s2">between Cain and this force so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.390" end="00:13:57.490" style="s2">a creative interplay it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.640" end="00:13:59.560" style="s2">he&#39;s dominated by the sin it&#39;s that he</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.490" end="00:14:02.050" style="s2">brings it in and enters into a creative</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.560" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">union with it and produces something out</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.050" end="00:14:06.430" style="s2">of the out of the mixture and so for</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:08.200" style="s2">example when I was reading the Columbine</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.430" end="00:14:10.030" style="s2">kid&#39;s writings it&#39;s like you can see</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.200" end="00:14:12.580" style="s2">exactly that in their behavior it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.030" end="00:14:14.680" style="s2">he knew perfectly well what he was up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.580" end="00:14:16.570" style="s2">he knew perfectly well what he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.680" end="00:14:19.090" style="s2">inviting in and he put his own</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.570" end="00:14:20.770" style="s2">extraordinarily creative twist on it it</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.090" end="00:14:21.470" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just that he was possessed by an</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.770" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.470" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">he spent months planning with his</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:26.690" style="s2">horrible little compatriot about exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:28.190" style="s2">how they were going to blow up the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.690" end="00:14:29.390" style="s2">school and the town and they would have</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.190" end="00:14:31.490" style="s2">liked to have blown up the whole damn</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.390" end="00:14:33.260" style="s2">city that was part of their plan and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.490" end="00:14:35.450" style="s2">exactly how are they were going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.260" end="00:14:36.980" style="s2">that into a creative spectacle that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.450" end="00:14:39.530" style="s2">would be covered by networks all over</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.980" end="00:14:41.450" style="s2">the laughs perfectly consciously every</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.530" end="00:14:43.280" style="s2">single bit of this so they put their own</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.450" end="00:14:46.220" style="s2">twist on it as a consequence of being</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.280" end="00:14:51.730" style="s2">angry and resentful and unhappy you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.220" end="00:14:53.750" style="s2">so anyways so God tells Kane you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.730" end="00:14:55.340" style="s2">why are you coming to complain to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.750" end="00:14:57.200" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.340" end="00:14:58.760" style="s2">you like you get your act together and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.200" end="00:15:00.680" style="s2">behave properly you can stand up huh</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.760" end="00:15:02.990" style="s2">hold your head up high and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.680" end="00:15:04.640" style="s2">have to let this thing that&#39;s tempting</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.990" end="00:15:06.380" style="s2">you have its way with you and enter into</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.640" end="00:15:09.260" style="s2">a creative union with it you could just</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.380" end="00:15:12.080" style="s2">behave properly and so Kane leaves and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.260" end="00:15:13.490" style="s2">then he&#39;s really annoyed and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.080" end="00:15:14.540" style="s2">he&#39;s annoyed is because he&#39;s going in</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.490" end="00:15:16.430" style="s2">their hope and they deal straight and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.540" end="00:15:18.200" style="s2">gone out with a little chat and sent</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.430" end="00:15:19.550" style="s2">reality straight and basically what he</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.200" end="00:15:20.780" style="s2">finds out is that as far as God is</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.550" end="00:15:22.190" style="s2">concerned the reason that all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.780" end="00:15:23.930" style="s2">terrible things are happening to him is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.190" end="00:15:25.970" style="s2">because he&#39;s not anywhere near what he</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.930" end="00:15:29.030" style="s2">could be and he&#39;s setting himself up for</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.970" end="00:15:31.130" style="s2">continual failure and so that really</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.030" end="00:15:32.870" style="s2">annoys him so no not only is he mad</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.130" end="00:15:34.670" style="s2">about the fact that he&#39;s failing but</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.870" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">he&#39;s even more mad because when he</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.670" end="00:15:37.820" style="s2">thought it through he realized that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:39.140" style="s2">was actually his fault and that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.820" end="00:15:41.090" style="s2">reason these things are happening to him</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.140" end="00:15:42.440" style="s2">is because he&#39;s not what he could be so</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.090" end="00:15:44.360" style="s2">then you might think well what does he</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.440" end="00:15:46.250" style="s2">do as a consequence you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.360" end="00:15:48.110" style="s2">think well he could say well a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.250" end="00:15:49.910" style="s2">apology to God and try to get himself on</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.110" end="00:15:51.800" style="s2">the right track and that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.910" end="00:15:55.070" style="s2">happens at all he goes and kills Abel</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.800" end="00:15:57.050" style="s2">with a rock now you think well why does</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.070" end="00:15:59.720" style="s2">he do that well that&#39;s very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.050" end="00:16:02.210" style="s2">it&#39;s partly well Abel is obviously God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.720" end="00:16:04.400" style="s2">favorite so he&#39;s doing everything he can</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.210" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">to pull him down and you think people do</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.400" end="00:16:06.890" style="s2">that all the time</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">like if you&#39;re jealous of someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.890" end="00:16:10.220" style="s2">accomplishments these things really play</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:12.010" style="s2">themselves out in junior high in high</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.220" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">school but they also play out in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.010" end="00:16:16.670" style="s2">adult life you&#39;ll do everything you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.750" end="00:16:18.650" style="s2">to pull down the thing that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.670" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">hovering above you and making you look</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.650" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">bad from as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:26.390" style="s2">reflection it&#39;s easier to destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:29.030" style="s2">ideal than it is to try to live up to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.390" end="00:16:30.410" style="s2">and people do that all the time and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.030" end="00:16:32.420" style="s2">they&#39;re punishing each other for their</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.410" end="00:16:33.890" style="s2">virtues and they do that because well</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.420" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">first of all because they can pull down</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.890" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">the ideal and then they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">the mirror that makes themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:40.820" style="s2">uncomfortable but they can also do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:42.200" style="s2">as a revenge against God it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.820" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">if that&#39;s what you favor and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.200" end="00:16:46.490" style="s2">gonna torture me to death then I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:48.350" style="s2">destroy what you&#39;ve brought up to be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.490" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">best manifestation of what is at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.350" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">point and then we&#39;ll just see who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:55.399" style="s2">who&#39;s winning this war who&#39;s winning the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:58.339" style="s2">war of being and so that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.399" end="00:17:00.680" style="s2">he goes out and kills Abel and so God</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.800" end="00:23:38.270" style="s2">and hurt and Lamech says unto his wives</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.090" end="00:23:54.800" style="s2">and Sevenfold so there&#39;s this the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">of the exponential distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.800" end="00:23:58.730" style="s2">brutality into the community as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">consequence of this initial adoption of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.730" end="00:24:03.800" style="s2">a particular form of being okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:05.929" style="s2">here&#39;s the situation that that&#39;s laid</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.800" end="00:24:08.540" style="s2">out in Genesis as far as I can tell is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.929" end="00:24:10.490" style="s2">that people emerge itself conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.540" end="00:24:12.410" style="s2">that produces a terrible burden on</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.490" end="00:24:14.420" style="s2">people and then the burden is even</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.410" end="00:24:16.610" style="s2">either handled in the appropriate manner</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.420" end="00:24:19.190" style="s2">with the proper sacrifices or it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.610" end="00:24:21.620" style="s2">if it&#39;s not the consequences are that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.190" end="00:24:24.770" style="s2">everything degenerates into brutality</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.620" end="00:24:27.260" style="s2">and atrocity and that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.770" end="00:24:29.660" style="s2">approximately correct and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.260" end="00:24:32.570" style="s2">understand both Cain enables motivations</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.660" end="00:24:34.280" style="s2">you know Cain gets brutal and resentment</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.570" end="00:24:36.110" style="s2">&#39;fl because things don&#39;t go well for him</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.280" end="00:24:38.870" style="s2">and because he&#39;s suffering and it might</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.110" end="00:24:40.250" style="s2">be arbitrary you know and sometimes your</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.870" end="00:24:42.679" style="s2">suffering does seem to be entirely</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.250" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">arbitrary but part of the moral of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.679" end="00:24:47.660" style="s2">story is that if you allow that to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:49.790" style="s2">you resentful and vengeful that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.660" end="00:24:52.309" style="s2">participate in processes that make</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.790" end="00:24:54.980" style="s2">things absolutely unbearable and make</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.309" end="00:24:57.050" style="s2">the entire situation much worse and all</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.980" end="00:24:58.490" style="s2">the existential commentary I&#39;ve read on</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.050" end="00:25:01.340" style="s2">the things that happened in the Second</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.490" end="00:25:03.110" style="s2">World War and in estelle in this Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.340" end="00:25:05.090" style="s2">Union and in China for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.110" end="00:25:07.580" style="s2">seemed to lay out exactly the same story</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.090" end="00:25:09.650" style="s2">which is once individuals get corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.580" end="00:25:11.420" style="s2">because they&#39;re unhappy with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.650" end="00:25:13.400" style="s2">structure of their being they can</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.420" end="00:25:15.500" style="s2">corrupt the entire social landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.400" end="00:25:17.059" style="s2">the entire world and things go from bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.500" end="00:25:20.809" style="s2">to worse until they&#39;re as bad as they</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.059" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">can possibly be so that&#39;s how things go</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.809" end="00:25:25.280" style="s2">badly you might think well how do things</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:26.600" style="s2">go well and you know unfortunately we</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.280" end="00:25:28.520" style="s2">missed one lecture but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.600" end="00:25:30.330" style="s2">things that I can tell you that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.520" end="00:25:36.070" style="s2">think I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.330" end="00:25:37.870" style="s2">what what are you laughing about no no</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.070" end="00:25:39.399" style="s2">no no well there&#39;s there&#39;s other things</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.870" end="00:25:41.169" style="s2">that I wanted to tell you about but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.399" end="00:25:42.820" style="s2">can tell you about this anyways I just</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.169" end="00:25:45.759" style="s2">can&#39;t do it in quite as much depth as I</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.820" end="00:25:47.350" style="s2">would have liked to so it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.759" end="00:25:49.480" style="s2">to me that it&#39;s reasonable to try to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.350" end="00:25:51.340" style="s2">impose an ideological solution on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.480" end="00:25:53.049" style="s2">world and the reason that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.340" end="00:25:55.029" style="s2">reasonable is because it leads you into</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.049" end="00:25:57.970" style="s2">something that&#39;s akin to a sin of pride</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.029" end="00:25:59.740" style="s2">you think you have the damn answer you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.970" end="00:26:01.990" style="s2">think you know everything and you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.740" end="00:26:04.330" style="s2">impose that answer but the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.990" end="00:26:06.250" style="s2">that is that it seems to that&#39;s as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.330" end="00:26:08.230" style="s2">kind of sacrifice or that produces the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.250" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">kind of sacrifices that God doesn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.230" end="00:26:12.460" style="s2">very acceptable and things go from bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:14.259" style="s2">to worse so you might say well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.460" end="00:26:16.929" style="s2">the alternative what&#39;s the potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.259" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">alternative mode of being and so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.929" end="00:26:22.269" style="s2">something that you can think about and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.490" end="00:26:23.620" style="s2">and there&#39;s one thing that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.269" end="00:26:26.139" style="s2">tell you about Christianity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.620" end="00:26:28.059" style="s2">relevant in this regard so you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.139" end="00:26:29.830" style="s2">you&#39;ll see this in the last quarter of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.059" end="00:26:31.450" style="s2">the of maps of meaning when you read it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.830" end="00:26:33.490" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s images that have</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.450" end="00:26:36.490" style="s2">popped up in the Middle Ages where the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.490" end="00:26:38.200" style="s2">tree of the tree in the in the Garden of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.490" end="00:26:39.909" style="s2">Eden is there again and on the one side</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.200" end="00:26:42.580" style="s2">of the tree there are skulls and those</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.909" end="00:26:44.350" style="s2">are being handed out by Eve and on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.580" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">other hand side there are these little</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.350" end="00:26:48.850" style="s2">things that are there like fruits but</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:50.259" style="s2">they&#39;re representatives of the hosts</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.850" end="00:26:52.659" style="s2">that are given to people when they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.259" end="00:26:54.220" style="s2">undergo the mass in Christianity and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.659" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">those little hosts which are made out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.220" end="00:26:59.049" style="s2">wheat which is a dying and resurrecting</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:00.909" style="s2">God are like the body of the hero and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.049" end="00:27:02.620" style="s2">the idea behind the mass is that in</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.909" end="00:27:04.629" style="s2">order to overcome death you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.620" end="00:27:06.759" style="s2">to incorporate the body of the hero and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.629" end="00:27:09.309" style="s2">the body of the hero the hero is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.759" end="00:27:12.220" style="s2">person in this mythological landscape</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.309" end="00:27:14.769" style="s2">who is willing to voluntarily confront</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.220" end="00:27:17.620" style="s2">death and will as a consequence be</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.769" end="00:27:19.450" style="s2">reborn now I think that that can be read</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.620" end="00:27:21.309" style="s2">at at a psychological level because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.450" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">already talked about the fact that one</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.309" end="00:27:25.090" style="s2">of the things that happens that when</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:26.980" style="s2">you&#39;re in deep error is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.090" end="00:27:28.899" style="s2">allow the erroneous structure to</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.980" end="00:27:31.809" style="s2">dissolve into something that&#39;s chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.899" end="00:27:34.929" style="s2">and then have it reimagining that&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.809" end="00:27:36.549" style="s2">the idea that&#39;s lurking behind this idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.929" end="00:27:39.389" style="s2">of transformation is that you should</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.549" end="00:27:41.769" style="s2">identify yourself not with the initial</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.389" end="00:27:43.270" style="s2">state of order which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.769" end="00:27:45.670" style="s2">particular way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.270" end="00:27:47.590" style="s2">old and you shouldn&#39;t identify yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.670" end="00:27:50.470" style="s2">with the state of chaos that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.590" end="00:27:52.270" style="s2">when everything collapses around you but</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.470" end="00:27:54.580" style="s2">that you should identify yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.270" end="00:27:57.190" style="s2">the process of transformation from order</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.580" end="00:27:59.250" style="s2">through chaos and then into a new form</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.190" end="00:28:01.750" style="s2">of being and so the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.250" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">confront the fact that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.750" end="00:28:07.000" style="s2">continually transforming is by allowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.210" end="00:28:09.010" style="s2">yourself to transform with it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.000" end="00:28:12.180" style="s2">the volunteer that&#39;s the voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.010" end="00:28:16.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the taking on of the voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.180" end="00:28:18.400" style="s2">that of continual voluntary death and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.030" end="00:28:20.530" style="s2">rebirth in the service of higher being</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.400" end="00:28:24.490" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know the potential limits</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.530" end="00:28:27.310" style="s2">to that you know I mean obviously in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.490" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">current situation everyone is still</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.310" end="00:28:31.450" style="s2">faced with the possibility of ill health</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:33.310" style="s2">and a finite lifespan and all the things</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.450" end="00:28:35.830" style="s2">that go along with that but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.310" end="00:28:38.230" style="s2">know the limits of our potential dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.830" end="00:28:39.940" style="s2">flexibility and we sure do know that if</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.230" end="00:28:41.830" style="s2">you hold on to ways of being that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.940" end="00:28:43.960" style="s2">counterproductive for any length of time</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.830" end="00:28:45.640" style="s2">that that kills you faster and makes you</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.960" end="00:28:47.650" style="s2">more miserable well it&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.640" end="00:28:50.140" style="s2">the same thing happens as well when</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.650" end="00:28:53.890" style="s2">you&#39;re you know wallowing and trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.140" end="00:28:56.800" style="s2">a chaotic situation so so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.890" end="00:28:58.600" style="s2">hypothesis so you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.800" end="00:29:00.820" style="s2">that the New Agers will tell you is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.600" end="00:29:02.770" style="s2">you should follow your bliss and I have</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.820" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">a big problem with that because first of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.770" end="00:29:06.550" style="s2">all I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true and second</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.230" style="s2">because Jung pointed out that if you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.550" end="00:29:10.660" style="s2">follow what you find deeply meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.230" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to take you to a place that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.660" end="00:29:15.190" style="s2">you&#39;re most afraid of and so to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:19.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a barrier to enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.190" end="00:29:21.130" style="s2">the barrier is that you&#39;ll face things</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.510" end="00:29:23.080" style="s2">that will pull you apart before you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.130" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">face things that&#39;ll put you together and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.080" end="00:29:26.500" style="s2">I think that what you face that will</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.640" end="00:29:27.820" style="s2">pull you apart is all the things that</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.820" end="00:29:35.650" style="s2">sambar suboptimal those things have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.130" end="00:29:37.390" style="s2">be repaired and fixed now if you put</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.650" end="00:29:39.910" style="s2">yourself in a situation where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.390" end="00:29:42.130" style="s2">able to rectify the errors that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.910" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">made in the past so that you straighten</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.130" end="00:29:47.350" style="s2">out the manner in which you&#39;re organized</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:49.740" style="s2">then I think that it might be possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.350" end="00:29:52.180" style="s2">to live so that your forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.740" end="00:29:54.220" style="s2">confronting things as they move towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.180" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">you and if you&#39;re oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.220" end="00:29:56.740" style="s2">making them better like assume that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:29:58.270" style="s2">that&#39;s your highest</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.740" end="00:30:00.160" style="s2">value say well what&#39;s the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.270" end="00:30:02.140" style="s2">life and the purpose of life is to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.160" end="00:30:04.330" style="s2">things as good as you can possibly make</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.140" end="00:30:06.070" style="s2">them and that might be for you and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.330" end="00:30:07.750" style="s2">might be for those around you and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.070" end="00:30:10.059" style="s2">might not even know exactly what that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.750" end="00:30:12.850" style="s2">means so sometimes you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.059" end="00:30:16.840" style="s2">let go of what you think good is as you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.850" end="00:30:19.179" style="s2">progress towards it well it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.840" end="00:30:23.860" style="s2">that if you orient yourself towards that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.179" end="00:30:27.100" style="s2">and you allow yourself to stop living in</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.860" end="00:30:29.170" style="s2">in in theories that you know to be false</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.100" end="00:30:32.440" style="s2">and carrying falsehoods that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.170" end="00:30:35.470" style="s2">acting out and and believing in that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.440" end="00:30:46.510" style="s2">know to be not true that you can start</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.470" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">to live in a different way so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.510" end="00:30:54.940" style="s2">different way in some sense so the first</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:56.850" style="s2">thing you have to figure out is that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.940" end="00:30:59.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.850" end="00:31:01.240" style="s2">the second you have to think to figure</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.410" end="00:31:02.440" style="s2">out and that&#39;s humility I think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.240" end="00:31:05.260" style="s2">second thing you have to figure out is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.440" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">what you want and you either want things</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.260" end="00:31:09.070" style="s2">to be better or you want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:11.500" style="s2">worse and there&#39;s reasons for wanting</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.070" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">them to be worse and the reasons are</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.500" end="00:31:17.050" style="s2">deep and they&#39;re justifiable but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:18.400" style="s2">not helpful so then let&#39;s assume that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.050" end="00:31:20.679" style="s2">you&#39;ve noticed the part of you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.400" end="00:31:22.179" style="s2">devoted like came to the destruction of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.679" end="00:31:23.860" style="s2">things and you understand what that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.179" end="00:31:27.309" style="s2">and you&#39;re willing to take it onto</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.860" end="00:31:28.840" style="s2">yourself to repair then it isn&#39;t other</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.309" end="00:31:31.900" style="s2">people&#39;s evil that you have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.840" end="00:31:36.309" style="s2">about it&#39;s your own then you might say</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.900" end="00:31:39.370" style="s2">well what should you do next and one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.309" end="00:31:41.890" style="s2">the one of the pieces of literature from</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.370" end="00:31:43.660" style="s2">which I&#39;ve learned from that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.890" end="00:31:45.640" style="s2">address that is the Sermon on the Mount</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.660" end="00:31:47.140" style="s2">in the New Testament one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.640" end="00:31:49.929" style="s2">happens in the Sermon on the Mount is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.140" end="00:31:52.630" style="s2">this so Christ says to his followers</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.929" end="00:31:55.030" style="s2">that they should there there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.630" end="00:31:56.980" style="s2">something specifically that they should</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.030" end="00:31:59.020" style="s2">be pursuing what they should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.980" end="00:32:00.670" style="s2">instead of orienting themselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.020" end="00:32:04.020" style="s2">particular direction and the direction</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.670" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">would be towards what&#39;s best and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.020" end="00:32:10.059" style="s2">true so that&#39;s the first step as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">figure out do you want things to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.059" end="00:32:12.520" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:14.049" style="s2">you want them to be worse that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.520" end="00:32:16.020" style="s2">fundamental question so are you working</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.049" end="00:32:18.760" style="s2">for the betterment of being or for its</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.020" end="00:32:20.140" style="s2">transformation into help and then you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.760" end="00:32:21.669" style="s2">think well I want things to be better</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.140" end="00:32:23.470" style="s2">then the next thing you think is well</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.669" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">you don&#39;t exactly know how to go about</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.470" end="00:32:29.380" style="s2">that okay so then what do you do well it</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:32.350" style="s2">seems to me that that&#39;s the point at</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.380" end="00:32:34.840" style="s2">time when you try to eradicate from your</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.350" end="00:32:37.510" style="s2">field of apprehension everything that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.840" end="00:32:39.850" style="s2">you know to be false and unworthy you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.510" end="00:32:41.620" style="s2">get rid of it as much as you can as fast</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.850" end="00:32:43.929" style="s2">as you can and part of the way you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.620" end="00:32:47.110" style="s2">do that is by listening to what you say</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.929" end="00:32:49.630" style="s2">and watching what you do and you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.110" end="00:32:51.580" style="s2">listen to what you say and you can find</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.630" end="00:32:53.860" style="s2">out if you&#39;re actually saying what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.580" end="00:32:56.290" style="s2">believe to be true now here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.860" end="00:32:58.570" style="s2">hypothesis and I think this is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.290" end="00:33:00.340" style="s2">hypothesis that&#39;s laid out in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.570" end="00:33:02.200" style="s2">transformation from the Old Testament to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.340" end="00:33:04.090" style="s2">the New Testament in Christianity but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.200" end="00:33:06.549" style="s2">also think it&#39;s the same idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.090" end="00:33:08.770" style="s2">Daoists were pursuing and the Buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.549" end="00:33:12.130" style="s2">were pursuing so the idea is this and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.770" end="00:33:14.860" style="s2">it&#39;s based on the idea of logos what</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.130" end="00:33:18.040" style="s2">would happen if instead of pursuing what</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.860" end="00:33:20.620" style="s2">you think you should be pursuing you did</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.040" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">something else which is you set yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.620" end="00:33:24.429" style="s2">in a position where you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.970" end="00:33:26.890" style="s2">make things better and the next</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.429" end="00:33:28.809" style="s2">consequence of that is to try to say as</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.890" end="00:33:29.950" style="s2">clearly as what you posit as you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.809" end="00:33:32.020" style="s2">possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.950" end="00:33:36.400" style="s2">what it is that you believe to be true</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.020" end="00:33:39.640" style="s2">in every situation and then to see what</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.400" end="00:33:42.520" style="s2">happens it&#39;s a different way of playing</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.640" end="00:33:44.440" style="s2">the same game now in the Sermon on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.520" end="00:33:46.809" style="s2">Mount what Christ tells his followers is</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.440" end="00:33:50.380" style="s2">to orient themselves towards paradise</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.809" end="00:33:51.880" style="s2">and truth fundamentally and then to</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.380" end="00:33:53.470" style="s2">concentrate on doing everything they</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.880" end="00:33:55.780" style="s2">possibly can moment to moment as</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.470" end="00:33:59.860" style="s2">carefully and correctly as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.780" end="00:34:01.690" style="s2">then to see what happens so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.860" end="00:34:04.120" style="s2">ancient idea that&#39;s at the root of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.690" end="00:34:07.630" style="s2">Western culture that being is spoken</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.120" end="00:34:09.790" style="s2">into existence and that&#39;s that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.630" end="00:34:13.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the speech of the logos and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.790" end="00:34:15.460" style="s2">the idea there is also partly that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.030" end="00:34:17.470" style="s2">in hairs inside people if they if</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.460" end="00:34:19.720" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to utilize it and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.470" end="00:34:22.210" style="s2">they know how they can utilize it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.720" end="00:34:23.600" style="s2">the way to utilize that is to straighten</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.210" end="00:34:26.870" style="s2">out your speech in action</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.600" end="00:34:29.260" style="s2">and to act as well as you can moment to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.870" end="00:34:32.390" style="s2">moment and to let go other than that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.260" end="00:34:34.550" style="s2">see what happens because and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.390" end="00:34:36.260" style="s2">that that&#39;s the movement of faith that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.550" end="00:34:39.830" style="s2">the existentialist Christians</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.260" end="00:34:41.120" style="s2">continually talk about you can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.830" end="00:34:43.490" style="s2">the thing is if you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.120" end="00:34:45.740" style="s2">something specific that constitutes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.490" end="00:34:48.140" style="s2">good then basically what you&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.740" end="00:34:50.510" style="s2">made yourself a kind of Idol you said</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.140" end="00:34:51.920" style="s2">well this is paradise and God but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.510" end="00:34:54.110" style="s2">thing is you don&#39;t know that because</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.920" end="00:34:55.820" style="s2">you&#39;re not sufficiently informed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.110" end="00:34:58.250" style="s2">understand the ultimate nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.820" end="00:34:59.870" style="s2">good but I think you&#39;re sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.250" end="00:35:02.540" style="s2">informed to figure out when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.870" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">using your language properly and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.540" end="00:35:05.990" style="s2">one of the things that you can notice is</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:07.820" style="s2">that if you&#39;re not using it properly it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.990" end="00:35:09.830" style="s2">makes you ashamed and weak and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.820" end="00:35:12.290" style="s2">embarrassed and I think you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.830" end="00:35:15.020" style="s2">that you can feel it fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.290" end="00:35:17.810" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what Cain does and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.020" end="00:35:19.160" style="s2">what God tells them to stop doing he</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.810" end="00:35:20.840" style="s2">says if you&#39;re doing things right you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.160" end="00:35:23.210" style="s2">can stand up with your head held high</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.840" end="00:35:25.100" style="s2">and if you&#39;re not you can&#39;t your</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.210" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">downcast and angry and resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.100" end="00:35:33.290" style="s2">murderous and I think that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:34.820" style="s2">case so and I do believe that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.290" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">different way of being because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.820" end="00:35:39.620" style="s2">aimed at something it&#39;s not aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:42.590" style="s2">something that&#39;s predefined you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.620" end="00:35:45.080" style="s2">under you have to allow what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.590" end="00:35:47.030" style="s2">the good and your understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.080" end="00:35:49.640" style="s2">good to continually be updated as you</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.030" end="00:35:51.650" style="s2">pursue it and I think all you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.640" end="00:35:53.840" style="s2">to do that is to speak words well</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.650" end="00:35:56.420" style="s2">Northrop Frye would say is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.840" end="00:35:58.370" style="s2">to speak words with power and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.420" end="00:36:04.340" style="s2">you can learn to do that but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.370" end="00:36:07.640" style="s2">let go and I think that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.340" end="00:36:09.110" style="s2">that&#39;s the cure for ad ology you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.640" end="00:36:10.550" style="s2">because what&#39;s the alternative you can</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.550" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">impose it or you can play along and see</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.300" end="00:36:17.120" style="s2">if you can figure out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.800" end="00:36:18.770" style="s2">and if you have a productive</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.120" end="00:36:21.500" style="s2">conversation with someone that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.770" end="00:36:22.820" style="s2">you&#39;re doing you know you say well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.500" end="00:36:24.680" style="s2">see if we can figure out how to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.820" end="00:36:26.540" style="s2">along maybe this is within the confines</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.680" end="00:36:31.340" style="s2">of an intimate relationship it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.540" end="00:36:33.560" style="s2">okay what do you want what do I want how</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.340" end="00:36:35.450" style="s2">is that going to fit together can we</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.560" end="00:36:37.190" style="s2">communicate honestly about exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.450" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">that is and how we might get it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.190" end="00:36:41.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a process of CO discovery it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:43.190" style="s2">like you know the answer to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.480" end="00:36:45.410" style="s2">and you&#39;re not going to find it unless</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.190" end="00:36:46.819" style="s2">you tell each other the truth and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.410" end="00:36:48.260" style="s2">not going to be able to pursue it unless</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.819" end="00:36:50.270" style="s2">you act out the truth that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.260" end="00:36:51.890" style="s2">articulate and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.660" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">good and that&#39;s a very difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.869" end="00:37:00.440" style="s2">to figure out but I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">things we do know after the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.440" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">that the continual attempt to make the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.589" style="s2">world as atrocious a place as possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.490" end="00:37:07.990" style="s2">seems to be searching in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.589" end="00:37:10.250" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.990" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">no you know I&#39;ve tried this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.250" end="00:37:14.270" style="s2">thing for a very long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.839" end="00:37:16.250" style="s2">because I think that what I try to do or</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.270" end="00:37:18.950" style="s2">why what I try to do is to say what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.250" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">believe to be the case in every</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.950" end="00:37:23.930" style="s2">situation that I&#39;m in and to see what</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:26.900" style="s2">happens and my experiences being that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.930" end="00:37:28.099" style="s2">really works like it really works you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.900" end="00:37:29.930" style="s2">can learn to get along with the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.099" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">in your family and help them straighten</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.930" end="00:37:33.549" style="s2">out and you can start to have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:36.170" style="s2">relatively beneficial effect on</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.549" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">processes that are outside of your you</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.170" end="00:37:40.549" style="s2">know of what&#39;s right in front of you and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:42.289" style="s2">within your grasp so you can practice</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.549" end="00:37:44.569" style="s2">trying to figure out how to set things</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.289" end="00:37:47.210" style="s2">straight and I have no idea what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.569" end="00:37:48.740" style="s2">ultimate limits of that might be but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.210" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">can tell you one thing it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.740" end="00:37:53.299" style="s2">makes your life and ridiculously</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:55.130" style="s2">interesting and you know that in itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.299" end="00:37:57.109" style="s2">is one of the things that takes away the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.130" end="00:37:58.789" style="s2">sting of mortality because if what</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.109" end="00:38:00.799" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is so damn interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.789" end="00:38:02.839" style="s2">can hardly stand it the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.799" end="00:38:05.510" style="s2">have to pay a price as you move along</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.839" end="00:38:07.190" style="s2">starts to become acceptable you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.510" end="00:38:09.319" style="s2">because you&#39;ll pay a price if it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.190" end="00:38:11.869" style="s2">it it&#39;s Nietzsche said if you have a Y</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.319" end="00:38:13.670" style="s2">you can bear anyhow and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.869" end="00:38:16.369" style="s2">some truth in that and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.670" end="00:38:19.210" style="s2">might say well what&#39;s what&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.369" end="00:38:21.589" style="s2">that&#39;s sufficiently good to justify</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.210" end="00:38:23.180" style="s2">voluntarily participating in being</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.589" end="00:38:25.640" style="s2">that&#39;s bent on your misery and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.180" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">destruction that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.640" end="00:38:29.660" style="s2">question of life well I would say you</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.789" style="s2">need a pretty elevated vision in order</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.660" end="00:38:34.579" style="s2">to counteract that and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.789" end="00:38:35.930" style="s2">what a vision of paradise is and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.579" end="00:38:38.990" style="s2">that paradise is something that people</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.930" end="00:38:40.730" style="s2">have to build I think if we build it</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.990" end="00:38:42.740" style="s2">properly it would justify everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.730" end="00:38:46.039" style="s2">that happened on the way to building it</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.740" end="00:38:49.590" style="s2">or at least that might be the case and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.039" end="00:38:51.690" style="s2">think you can do it locally first</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.590" end="00:38:53.160" style="s2">so and I can&#39;t see and I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.690" end="00:38:55.890" style="s2">people I&#39;ve watched how people have</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.160" end="00:38:57.930" style="s2">lived live now for decades and I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.890" end="00:39:00.150" style="s2">two clients in my practice right now who</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.930" end="00:39:03.330" style="s2">one of them was pretty damn straight to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.150" end="00:39:05.720" style="s2">begin with but he&#39;s set up his his</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.330" end="00:39:08.220" style="s2">business it happens to be a firm and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.720" end="00:39:10.140" style="s2">he&#39;s tried to make absolutely straight</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.220" end="00:39:11.820" style="s2">decisions that were really informed and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.140" end="00:39:15.300" style="s2">proper the entire way along and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.820" end="00:39:17.610" style="s2">bloody thing is running like a like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.300" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">running it&#39;s equilibrate it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.610" end="00:39:22.440" style="s2">extremely effective it&#39;s not wasteful</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:24.740" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s inside the organization</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.440" end="00:39:27.870" style="s2">is developing properly</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.740" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">no one&#39;s getting screwed over like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.870" end="00:39:31.080" style="s2">it&#39;s an honest and straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:32.610" style="s2">enterprise and everybody seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.080" end="00:39:35.160" style="s2">benefitting from it and I have another</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.610" end="00:39:37.160" style="s2">client who was pretty damn confused and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.160" end="00:39:40.980" style="s2">arrogant and resentful when he first</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.160" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">started changing his life and he put</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.980" end="00:39:45.000" style="s2">together a relatively small business and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:47.010" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s a low status business</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.000" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">but he&#39;s done it as honestly as he</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.010" end="00:39:51.600" style="s2">possibly could and he tried to keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:52.980" style="s2">himself on the straight and narrow while</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.600" end="00:39:55.350" style="s2">he&#39;s doing it and he&#39;s trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.980" end="00:39:56.790" style="s2">his customers outstanding service and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.350" end="00:39:59.820" style="s2">be clear and straight with them at every</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.790" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">single choice moment and that&#39;s lifted</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.820" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">his cynicism and it&#39;s made his business</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:09.510" style="s2">very very productive and and positive</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">and so I can&#39;t see first of all there</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.510" end="00:40:14.280" style="s2">has to be some antidote ideology because</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:18.420" style="s2">it&#39;s corrosive and and destructive and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.280" end="00:40:20.580" style="s2">can&#39;t see that there&#39;s any any end that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.420" end="00:40:24.180" style="s2">you can attain at any means that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.580" end="00:40:26.970" style="s2">implement that&#39;s more meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.180" end="00:40:28.620" style="s2">rich and deep than that and I do think</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.970" end="00:40:31.080" style="s2">it&#39;s sufficient to start you from being</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.620" end="00:40:32.790" style="s2">corrupted and Jenna Seidel and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.080" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">good thing because you can get corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.790" end="00:40:38.850" style="s2">in genocide &#39;el and if there&#39;s enough of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:41.700" style="s2">us who are corrupt and genocidal then</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.850" end="00:40:49.380" style="s2">things are gonna get very bad instead of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.700" end="00:40:50.670" style="s2">very good so well so then you can think</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.380" end="00:40:54.930" style="s2">about that and I think it&#39;s an easy</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.670" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">thing to start to try the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:40:58.920" style="s2">you have to do is decide if you want</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:00.390" style="s2">things to be better or worse and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.920" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">not a simple question because there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.390" end="00:41:03.830" style="s2">be a lot of you that&#39;s bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:05.570" style="s2">resentful and vengeful and angry</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.830" end="00:41:08.450" style="s2">for all of your inadequacies and the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.570" end="00:41:10.850" style="s2">the world&#39;s treated you and so and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.450" end="00:41:13.220" style="s2">second thing is pay attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.850" end="00:41:16.490" style="s2">you say and see if you believe it and if</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.220" end="00:41:18.290" style="s2">you don&#39;t quit saying it see what</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.490" end="00:41:20.150" style="s2">happens like you can tell if what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.290" end="00:41:22.310" style="s2">say makes you strong or if it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.150" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">weak all you have to do is feel it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.310" end="00:41:28.570" style="s2">you can stop saying things that make you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:30.710" style="s2">weak but it&#39;ll change you completely so</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.570" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll find that you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.710" end="00:41:34.610" style="s2">associate with people who only allow you</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:36.710" style="s2">to say things that make you weak for</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.610" end="00:41:38.210" style="s2">example because lots of people would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.710" end="00:41:39.890" style="s2">upset if you say things that make you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.210" end="00:41:42.950" style="s2">strong around them because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.890" end="00:41:46.420" style="s2">want you to flourish and grow partly</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.950" end="00:41:46.420" style="s2">because it sheds a bad light on them</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.190" end="00:41:54.440" style="s2">anyways this is more of elaborated in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.070" end="00:41:55.880" style="s2">the last quarter of the book or there</p>
