<p begin="00:00:05.150" end="00:00:10.650" style="s2">wanna start with evolutionary psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.280" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">I don&#39;t know a huge amount about it but</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.650" end="00:00:14.490" style="s2">I know it&#39;s a relatively new discipline</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.570" end="00:00:16.250" style="s2">compared to many other disciplines could</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">you just give the sort of potted history</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.250" end="00:00:21.750" style="s2">explainer of what evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">psychology is conceptually evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.750" end="00:00:26.420" style="s2">psychology is just trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">human nature human nature in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.420" end="00:00:32.489" style="s2">what challenges our ancestors faced in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">prehistory how did they survive how did</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.489" end="00:00:38.280" style="s2">they find mates how did they reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:41.300" style="s2">raise kids find food all of that so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.280" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">try to understand a lot of that from</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.300" end="00:00:47.450" style="s2">archaeology anthropology hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:49.829" style="s2">studies behavior genetics etc</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.450" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">emotionally though evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">psychology I think is basically respect</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">for our ancestors it&#39;s realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:02.489" style="s2">we&#39;re descended from a long line of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">successful people and pre people you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.489" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">know hominids and animals and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">paying attention to what did they do</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:13.859" style="s2">that worked and what strategies would</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:17.700" style="s2">have succeeded or failed and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.859" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">thinking really hard about that so for</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:22.889" style="s2">me it&#39;s been partly a scientific journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:25.139" style="s2">of figuring out human nature but</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.889" end="00:01:26.959" style="s2">emotionally and maybe even politically</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.139" end="00:01:30.649" style="s2">it&#39;s been a process of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.959" end="00:01:32.819" style="s2">reconnecting with my ancestors and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.649" end="00:01:35.579" style="s2">think everybody who works in the field</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.819" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">for more than you know a decade or two</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.579" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">has both of those components to it</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:44.069" style="s2">and you mentioned politically then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:46.709" style="s2">really interesting because you&#39;re you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.069" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">written for couette you&#39;re kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.709" end="00:01:50.630" style="s2">this car I&#39;ve seen you on Twitter you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">kind of in this intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.630" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">conversation and is that somewhere that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:01:59.639" style="s2">you&#39;ve always been or is that partly</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:03.389" style="s2">because of what you&#39;ve the journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.639" end="00:02:06.389" style="s2">you&#39;ve been on through your work I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.389" end="00:02:09.570" style="s2">it&#39;s partly a scientific journey partly</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.389" end="00:02:10.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a sort of personal experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.570" end="00:02:12.920" style="s2">running</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.280" end="00:02:14.950" style="s2">with social justice activists or certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.920" end="00:02:17.690" style="s2">kinds of trouble partly it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.950" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">maturing and having certain experiences</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.690" end="00:02:24.650" style="s2">as a man as a dad you know and as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:27.170" style="s2">partner I mean I started out college</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.650" end="00:02:29.870" style="s2">pretty standard lefty I actually joined</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.170" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">the men&#39;s feminist union freshman year</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.870" end="00:02:37.670" style="s2">at Columbia and I had pretty standard</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:40.100" style="s2">liberal / libertarian views like I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.670" end="00:02:42.620" style="s2">in the era of Reagan being president in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.100" end="00:02:45.410" style="s2">America and I was completely appalled</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.620" end="00:02:47.470" style="s2">that he got re-elected in 84 when I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.410" end="00:02:51.470" style="s2">in college like how could anybody vote</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.470" end="00:02:54.830" style="s2">for this actor right and then my journey</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.470" end="00:02:57.410" style="s2">since then has been partly kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.830" end="00:03:01.459" style="s2">radicalized as a libertarian in grad</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.410" end="00:03:03.770" style="s2">school and then getting just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.459" end="00:03:05.930" style="s2">increasingly appreciative of certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.770" end="00:03:07.910" style="s2">kinds of traditionalist and conservative</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.930" end="00:03:10.370" style="s2">views but also getting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.910" end="00:03:12.350" style="s2">radicalized even farther left on other</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.370" end="00:03:14.950" style="s2">issues so it&#39;s a kind of complicated</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.350" end="00:03:17.450" style="s2">patchwork and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.950" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">it does seem that in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.450" end="00:03:23.500" style="s2">network around Colet around this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:26.360" style="s2">conversation there are quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.500" end="00:03:27.980" style="s2">evolutionary biologists evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.360" end="00:03:29.830" style="s2">psychologists is this because of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.980" end="00:03:34.070" style="s2">nature of the discipline you think I</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.830" end="00:03:36.709" style="s2">think the discipline makes you very wary</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.070" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">of certain kinds of claims that come out</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.709" end="00:03:41.690" style="s2">of the left like the mind is a blank</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:44.510" style="s2">slate and we can completely re-engineer</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.690" end="00:03:46.459" style="s2">men and women according to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.510" end="00:03:49.940" style="s2">happens to be politically correct we get</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.459" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">very skeptical about that I think partly</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.940" end="00:03:54.860" style="s2">at the moment it&#39;s the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:57.019" style="s2">actually willing to do evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.860" end="00:03:59.209" style="s2">psychology have to have extremely thick</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.019" end="00:04:02.120" style="s2">skins and have to be prepared to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.209" end="00:04:05.570" style="s2">battle for their ideas in an academic</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.120" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">environment that&#39;s largely hostile to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.570" end="00:04:10.730" style="s2">them and really punishes and stigmatizes</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">them so I think it kind of selects for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.730" end="00:04:17.650" style="s2">certain ornery personality types</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:20.209" style="s2">evolutionary psychology can you just</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.650" end="00:04:21.209" style="s2">summarize what it is for people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.209" end="00:04:22.350" style="s2">don&#39;t know because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:24.509" style="s2">understands the relatively new</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.350" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">discipline yeah it&#39;s mostly just an</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.509" end="00:04:28.970" style="s2">excuse to go back to the 1950s gender</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:34.590" style="s2">roles to keep women barefooted pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.970" end="00:04:36.449" style="s2">ya know it&#39;s a lens with which to view</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.590" end="00:04:38.940" style="s2">human psychology so it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.449" end="00:04:41.669" style="s2">generating hypotheses and predictions</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.940" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">based on what would have been adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.669" end="00:04:46.889" style="s2">so we think about things in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:48.599" style="s2">different ways and so if you saw a robot</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.889" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">in the desert and you saw that it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.599" end="00:04:51.960" style="s2">moving around and you saw that it had</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">survived there for some years you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.960" end="00:04:55.650" style="s2">know that it had certain features you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:57.030" style="s2">would know that it was resistant to sand</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.650" end="00:04:59.610" style="s2">erosion you would know that it was able</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.030" end="00:05:00.780" style="s2">to actually use the Sun potentially at</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.610" end="00:05:02.669" style="s2">power itself you would know it had</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.780" end="00:05:04.949" style="s2">certain characteristics and we know just</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.669" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">on the basis that humans have survived</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.949" end="00:05:09.210" style="s2">on earth for many millions of years in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:11.669" style="s2">our current form in and other forms and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">have reproduced that we have certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.669" end="00:05:16.470" style="s2">characteristics and that we lived in</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:17.669" style="s2">groups and that we lived you know for</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.470" end="00:05:20.280" style="s2">some period of time on the African</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.669" end="00:05:22.620" style="s2">savannah and all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.280" end="00:05:24.509" style="s2">things lead us to have some idea about</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.620" end="00:05:26.310" style="s2">how human psychology might function if</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.509" end="00:05:29.159" style="s2">you were going to design a program in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.310" end="00:05:32.220" style="s2">order to survive and reproduce to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.159" end="00:05:35.250" style="s2">attract mates to increase your status to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.220" end="00:05:37.139" style="s2">engage socially to help get other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.250" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">to help you and to help others what</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.139" end="00:05:41.099" style="s2">kinds of programs would you implement in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.810" end="00:05:42.750" style="s2">order to make those things happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.099" end="00:05:44.520" style="s2">and evolutionary psychology thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.750" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">things from that perspective but also</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.520" end="00:05:48.900" style="s2">from a biological and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:51.539" style="s2">perspective looking at humans kind of as</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:53.250" style="s2">animals I think that one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.539" end="00:05:55.530" style="s2">things that happened and people was you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">know diverse as you know BF Skinner and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.530" end="00:05:58.469" style="s2">ecologists and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:01.139" style="s2">psychologists think that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.469" end="00:06:03.889" style="s2">we&#39;re too close to our own lines to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.139" end="00:06:06.120" style="s2">a good idea of what we really think and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.889" end="00:06:07.650" style="s2">many of the people who have come up with</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.120" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">these amazing insights into human</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.650" end="00:06:12.120" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:13.979" style="s2">were people who were like we know what</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.120" end="00:06:16.110" style="s2">Oliver Sacks called anthropologist on</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.979" end="00:06:17.580" style="s2">Mars people who felt alienated from</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.110" end="00:06:19.320" style="s2">other humans they were trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.580" end="00:06:21.570" style="s2">them out and they were able to think</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.320" end="00:06:24.120" style="s2">about things in a novel way in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.570" end="00:06:25.710" style="s2">foreigner kind of way because they</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.120" end="00:06:27.659" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually feel entirely human and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.710" end="00:06:29.130" style="s2">I think that evolutionary psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.659" end="00:06:32.250" style="s2">tries to have an objective perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.130" end="00:06:33.240" style="s2">on human minds in that way as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.250" end="00:06:33.689" style="s2">because he you mentioned at the</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.379" end="00:06:42.419" style="s2">there is an like when there is suspicion</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.589" end="00:06:48.119" style="s2">evolutionary psychology it is that by</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.119" end="00:06:51.929" style="s2">women what we&#39;re actually doing is</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.349" end="00:06:59.999" style="s2">to that criticism I just think you when</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.860" end="00:07:01.409" style="s2">you look at most evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.999" end="00:07:03.479" style="s2">psychologists they talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.409" end="00:07:05.610" style="s2">yeah like hunter-gatherer life like</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.159" end="00:07:10.139" style="s2">some people who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.089" end="00:07:12.179" style="s2">neo-traditionalist</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.139" end="00:07:14.579" style="s2">who talk about evolutionary psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.179" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">as a way to bolster some claims but</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.579" end="00:07:18.959" style="s2">certainly human beings were not</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:22.889" style="s2">monogamous at all and there was certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.959" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">you know men mostly had at least some</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.889" end="00:07:26.279" style="s2">high status men had multiple mates and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.019" style="s2">that&#39;s not anything that people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.279" end="00:07:29.519" style="s2">arguing for even though that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.019" end="00:07:32.009" style="s2">might argue from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.519" end="00:07:34.499" style="s2">perspective because 80% of all societies</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.009" end="00:07:36.059" style="s2">have been polygynous so how I respond to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.499" end="00:07:38.069" style="s2">that claim is yes some people use</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.059" end="00:07:39.839" style="s2">evolutionary psychology to bolster the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.069" end="00:07:42.029" style="s2">traditionalist view but then you also</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.839" end="00:07:43.649" style="s2">have people like Christopher Ryan trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.029" end="00:07:44.759" style="s2">to use evolutionary psychology to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.649" end="00:07:47.099" style="s2">bolster the view that we should all have</p>

<p begin="00:07:49.649" end="00:07:52.949" style="s2">Bible in that sense you can kind of use</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.119" end="00:07:54.839" style="s2">it to bolster what claims you want but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.949" end="00:07:56.069" style="s2">think all of these people get certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.839" end="00:07:57.479" style="s2">things wrong I think Christopher Ryan</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.069" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">gets a lot of things wrong I think</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.239" end="00:08:12.899" style="s2">that there are certain topics that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.889" end="00:08:16.559" style="s2">you&#39;re wary about teaching</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.899" end="00:08:18.119" style="s2">what are those topics and are they ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.559" end="00:08:19.169" style="s2">that you don&#39;t teach anymore you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.119" end="00:08:21.629" style="s2">a lot more cautious about the way you</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.169" end="00:08:24.439" style="s2">teach them some of them I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.629" end="00:08:27.389" style="s2">touch at all because there&#39;s almost no</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.439" end="00:08:30.689" style="s2">right way to approach them so for</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.389" end="00:08:32.550" style="s2">example trans issues transsexuality I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.689" end="00:08:36.059" style="s2">taught a human sexuality class for about</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.550" end="00:08:40.199" style="s2">20 years I know a reasonable amount</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.059" end="00:08:42.120" style="s2">about trans issues but you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.199" end="00:08:44.429" style="s2">have a class of a hundred students and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.120" end="00:08:44.980" style="s2">there&#39;s even one or two been radicalized</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.429" end="00:08:47.740" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.740" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">rights and I give a lecture about it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.459" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not pitch perfect in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:08:59.649" style="s2">I say I can get into big trouble about</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:01.180" style="s2">that on the other hand if I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.649" end="00:09:03.310" style="s2">things like the history of gay rights</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.180" end="00:09:06.220" style="s2">I&#39;m totally comfortable with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.310" end="00:09:08.920" style="s2">because I can say things that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.220" end="00:09:11.380" style="s2">factually correct I was actually you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.920" end="00:09:14.170" style="s2">know in New York as an undergrad when</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.380" end="00:09:17.110" style="s2">act up and the AIDS crisis hit and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.170" end="00:09:20.199" style="s2">very familiar with what a challenge that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.110" end="00:09:24.250" style="s2">was to to gay people I&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.199" end="00:09:28.029" style="s2">comfortable talking about polyamory open</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.250" end="00:09:31.300" style="s2">relationships BDSM kink lots of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.029" end="00:09:35.050" style="s2">stuff but then when you get into things</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.300" end="00:09:38.139" style="s2">like sex differences and personality</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.050" end="00:09:40.660" style="s2">traits or cognitive strengths then I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.139" end="00:09:44.050" style="s2">have to tread quite carefully again</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.660" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">there seems to be an all-out attack on</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.050" end="00:09:49.300" style="s2">on gender per se in some areas of of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:51.970" style="s2">left at the moment and I guess if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.300" end="00:09:55.149" style="s2">studying in a gender differences than</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.970" end="00:09:58.180" style="s2">you&#39;re in the in the process it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.149" end="00:10:02.529" style="s2">really weird moment in relations between</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.180" end="00:10:04.360" style="s2">the sexes where on the one hand you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.529" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">a kind of wholesale denial of sex</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.360" end="00:10:09.630" style="s2">differences by a lot of the left on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:12.670" style="s2">other hand you get a demonization of men</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.630" end="00:10:16.230" style="s2">right like everything that&#39;s wrong in</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.670" end="00:10:19.420" style="s2">history is due to men and patriarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.230" end="00:10:21.069" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like on the other hand on</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.420" end="00:10:23.740" style="s2">the one hand there&#39;s no essential sex</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.069" end="00:10:26.110" style="s2">differences on the other hand the core</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.740" end="00:10:28.510" style="s2">essential sex difference is men are evil</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.110" end="00:10:32.769" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.510" end="00:10:35.649" style="s2">reconcile those views but it makes very</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.769" end="00:10:38.319" style="s2">very difficult kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.649" end="00:10:41.410" style="s2">landscape to navigate at the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.319" end="00:10:43.690" style="s2">you mentioned masculinity and some</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.410" end="00:10:44.860" style="s2">people called a war on masculinity at</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.690" end="00:10:47.260" style="s2">the very least we have a war about</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.860" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">masculinity I think you could kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.260" end="00:10:51.699" style="s2">safely say and a big part of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:53.500" style="s2">recently seems to have been I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.699" end="00:10:56.430" style="s2">Gillette I have caused a lot of response</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.500" end="00:10:59.370" style="s2">but in a way the APA guidelines the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.430" end="00:11:02.089" style="s2">came close to pathologizing traditional</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.480" end="00:14:40.199" style="s2">those types of masculinity I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.510" end="00:14:41.880" style="s2">getting in touch with and getting in</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.199" end="00:14:45.720" style="s2">touch with your sexuality your sexual</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:03.329" style="s2">towards women I think it means finding a</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.079" end="00:15:06.540" style="s2">way to reconnect with other men</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.329" end="00:15:09.329" style="s2">through friendship through groups</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.129" end="00:15:28.319" style="s2">we have to reinvent that to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:29.910" style="s2">for the 21st century but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.319" end="00:15:31.739" style="s2">really useful to start with a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.910" end="00:15:35.189" style="s2">traditionalist view of a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.739" end="00:15:37.649" style="s2">roles and that&#39;s what a PA was was</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.189" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">rejecting so does traditional therapy</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.649" end="00:15:43.110" style="s2">not work so well for men is it more</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:45.929" style="s2">oriented towards a woman&#39;s way of being</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.110" end="00:15:47.670" style="s2">in the world yeah I mean Freud invented</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.929" end="00:15:51.749" style="s2">psychotherapy mostly to deal with female</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.670" end="00:15:54.149" style="s2">patients to deal with fairly neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.749" end="00:15:57.569" style="s2">unhappy depressed and anxious Viennese</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.149" end="00:16:00.360" style="s2">bourgeois women and to talk with them</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.569" end="00:16:02.339" style="s2">about their issues and I think for women</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.360" end="00:16:07.459" style="s2">talking about your issues particularly</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.339" end="00:16:11.160" style="s2">with your female friends or your</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.459" end="00:16:15.569" style="s2">sometimes your male mate can be good</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.160" end="00:16:17.489" style="s2">therapy I think for a lot of men in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.569" end="00:16:19.259" style="s2">way the last thing they want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.489" end="00:16:21.959" style="s2">talk about their vulnerabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.259" end="00:16:26.100" style="s2">their neuroses particularly with a woman</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.959" end="00:16:31.139" style="s2">I think it&#39;s often humiliating I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.100" end="00:16:33.629" style="s2">it&#39;s often counterproductive it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.139" end="00:16:36.059" style="s2">like if a guy is going to do individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.629" end="00:16:37.910" style="s2">psychotherapy on the one hand it might</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.059" end="00:16:40.980" style="s2">be more productive to do it with a guy</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.910" end="00:16:43.290" style="s2">who actually understands you on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.980" end="00:16:46.319" style="s2">other hand most guys now are actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.290" end="00:16:48.119" style="s2">more comfortable sharing their secrets</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.319" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">with a woman because women are like</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.119" end="00:16:54.749" style="s2">better listeners and they&#39;re more used</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:59.879" style="s2">to that so the whole therapy industry I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.749" end="00:17:01.949" style="s2">think is deeply dysfunctional when it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.879" end="00:17:05.610" style="s2">comes to dealing with male clients I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.949" end="00:17:08.100" style="s2">think it&#39;s often pretty good at dealing</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.610" end="00:17:10.860" style="s2">with female clients so how does</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.100" end="00:17:13.139" style="s2">evolutionary psychology influence what</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.860" end="00:17:14.490" style="s2">your view of masculinity was what what</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.139" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">lessons can we learn from evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.490" end="00:17:19.959" style="s2">psychology about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:22.120" style="s2">topic I think a lot I mean to me the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.959" end="00:17:25.059" style="s2">more you understand evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.120" end="00:17:27.640" style="s2">biology and animal behavior and ancestry</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.059" end="00:17:29.770" style="s2">and hunter-gatherer lifestyles the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.640" end="00:17:32.710" style="s2">better you can connect with your your</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.770" end="00:17:34.950" style="s2">true nature as a man and the better you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.710" end="00:17:38.860" style="s2">can understand your sort of path from</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.950" end="00:17:41.920" style="s2">puberty through young adulthood to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.860" end="00:17:46.690" style="s2">maturity and fatherhood and becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.920" end="00:17:48.520" style="s2">mentor and and so forth I think to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.690" end="00:17:51.190" style="s2">understand your sexuality when you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.520" end="00:17:54.429" style="s2">adolescent male it&#39;s it&#39;s virtually</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.190" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">impossible if you don&#39;t know some animal</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.429" end="00:17:59.920" style="s2">behavior and you don&#39;t understand how</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:02.050" style="s2">sexual selection shapes males and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.920" end="00:18:04.690" style="s2">females differently and how it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.050" end="00:18:06.220" style="s2">that for at least you know four thousand</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.690" end="00:18:09.850" style="s2">species of mammals and three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.220" end="00:18:14.760" style="s2">species of primates and that this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.850" end="00:18:17.110" style="s2">really deep stuff and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.760" end="00:18:22.809" style="s2">programmed into us to do things like</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.110" end="00:18:25.720" style="s2">seek sexual variety sexual novelty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.809" end="00:18:27.730" style="s2">not necessarily about you know spreading</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.720" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">or seeing in kind of a simple-minded way</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.730" end="00:18:33.550" style="s2">like every man wants to be an alpha</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:36.280" style="s2">Genghis Khan it&#39;s not that simple but to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.550" end="00:18:39.190" style="s2">a first approximation that&#39;s closer to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.280" end="00:18:41.950" style="s2">the truth than what most young men are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.190" end="00:18:43.900" style="s2">taught right which is that all of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.950" end="00:18:46.660" style="s2">sexual desires are basically ethically</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.900" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">illegitimate and you should act more</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.660" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">like girls in high school and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.310" end="00:18:59.900" style="s2">what else helps I think understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.290" end="00:19:02.780" style="s2">status seeking and how male status works</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.900" end="00:19:04.850" style="s2">and how like there&#39;s different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.780" end="00:19:07.550" style="s2">status that you can seek this formidable</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.850" end="00:19:10.730" style="s2">&#39;ti which is are you physically capable</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.550" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">of fighting and sort of overcoming then</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.730" end="00:19:15.350" style="s2">there&#39;s dominance which is more about</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:17.810" style="s2">your attitude and how you carry yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.350" end="00:19:20.420" style="s2">how you talk to other people</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.810" end="00:19:22.910" style="s2">particularly other men there&#39;s status</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.420" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">which is how respected are you people</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.910" end="00:19:28.040" style="s2">heard of you there&#39;s prestige which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:31.040" style="s2">what do you know do people want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.040" end="00:19:34.150" style="s2">from you and learn from you all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.040" end="00:19:36.650" style="s2">different things young men confuse them</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.150" end="00:19:38.540" style="s2">like they don&#39;t know they don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.650" end="00:19:40.600" style="s2">difference between formidable &#39;ti in</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.540" end="00:19:43.790" style="s2">terms of like winning a jiu-jitsu match</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.600" end="00:19:46.700" style="s2">versus prestige which is people seeking</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.790" end="00:19:48.470" style="s2">you out for advice so I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.700" end="00:19:50.510" style="s2">understanding sexuality understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.470" end="00:19:53.810" style="s2">status seeking that&#39;s just two examples</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.510" end="00:19:57.560" style="s2">where an evolutionary viewpoint really</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.810" end="00:20:00.260" style="s2">buys buys you a lot and obviously you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.560" end="00:20:03.950" style="s2">looking a lot at the differences between</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.260" end="00:20:05.870" style="s2">men and women and what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.950" end="00:20:07.790" style="s2">the way that conversation looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.870" end="00:20:10.760" style="s2">moment in so the media and the culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.790" end="00:20:12.710" style="s2">yeah well obviously there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.760" end="00:20:13.880" style="s2">very adversarial kinds of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.710" end="00:20:16.610" style="s2">happening in different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.880" end="00:20:19.220" style="s2">subcultures so there is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.610" end="00:20:23.210" style="s2">radical feminist movement that has a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.220" end="00:20:25.580" style="s2">view of men as being yet really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.210" end="00:20:27.620" style="s2">that actors generally but this</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.580" end="00:20:29.150" style="s2">impression that they have is that men</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.620" end="00:20:30.730" style="s2">are bad actors and they&#39;re toxic</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.150" end="00:20:33.830" style="s2">their starts with toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.730" end="00:20:35.510" style="s2">masculinity can&#39;t even say it because of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.830" end="00:20:38.510" style="s2">the way that men have been socialized</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.510" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">and men are superficial eyes by women so</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.510" end="00:20:44.180" style="s2">I usually don&#39;t understand in that whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:46.250" style="s2">you know how that all would work and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.180" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">then there&#39;s also you know pickup</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.250" end="00:20:49.310" style="s2">artists and red pill kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.650" style="s2">communities which also have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.310" end="00:20:54.350" style="s2">adversarial relationship to women which</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.650" end="00:20:57.410" style="s2">in some sense they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.350" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">trying to get one over on women so if</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.410" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">men are trying to maximize the amount of</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.340" end="00:21:32.200" style="s2">there&#39;s toxic masculinity so that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">happening and then I think the average</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.200" end="00:21:37.270" style="s2">person who&#39;s trying to engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:40.390" style="s2">opposite sex they don&#39;t know how much of</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.250" end="00:22:02.500" style="s2">who was going to do each task tried to</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.030" end="00:22:08.380" style="s2">constitutes a tremendous amount of</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.820" end="00:22:13.450" style="s2">actually very valuable for saving time</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.450" end="00:22:17.410" style="s2">you have to negotiate about they get a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.190" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">really bad rap so I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.410" end="00:22:21.910" style="s2">of confusion and there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:24.130" style="s2">adversarial dynamic that really doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.910" end="00:22:26.230" style="s2">need to be there and you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.130" end="00:22:28.060" style="s2">idea of toxic masculinity was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.230" end="00:22:31.080" style="s2">discussion around toxic masculinity in</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.060" end="00:22:34.090" style="s2">the culture and there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.080" end="00:22:35.880" style="s2">discussion of toxic femininity and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.090" end="00:22:37.780" style="s2">we need to ditch both of those terms but</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.880" end="00:22:38.440" style="s2">we didn&#39;t it really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.780" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">interview with Heather</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.440" end="00:22:42.790" style="s2">high end where she talked about that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:44.440" style="s2">it&#39;s been one of the most popular pieces</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.790" end="00:22:47.050" style="s2">we&#39;ve put out so there&#39;s clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.440" end="00:22:49.750" style="s2">hunger for at least a discussion of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.050" end="00:22:52.120" style="s2">other side of the coin what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.750" end="00:22:54.250" style="s2">the other side of the coin is there is I</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.120" end="00:22:55.870" style="s2">think I mean toxic masculinity is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.250" end="00:22:57.960" style="s2">little bit easier to pick up because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.870" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">think that men have tried to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.960" end="00:23:03.790" style="s2">status and dominance in a more narrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.120" end="00:23:06.810" style="s2">way so they&#39;ve had to achieve that with</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.790" end="00:23:09.880" style="s2">physical strength with aggression and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.810" end="00:23:11.410" style="s2">also yeah subjugation so all of that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.880" end="00:23:13.660" style="s2">ways that men have made a living for</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.410" end="00:23:14.470" style="s2">millions of years whereas I think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.660" end="00:23:17.230" style="s2">way that women have made</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.470" end="00:23:19.900" style="s2">living is more through psychological</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.230" end="00:23:21.820" style="s2">means you could call it manipulation or</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.900" end="00:23:25.179" style="s2">you could call it yeah you could just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.820" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">call inflation and so when I saw that</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.179" end="00:23:30.820" style="s2">piece she was saying it&#39;s toxic</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:31.809" style="s2">femininity to say that to tell a man</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.820" end="00:23:34.150" style="s2">that he shouldn&#39;t look at an attractive</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.809" end="00:23:36.669" style="s2">woman or to tell men that they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.150" end="00:23:38.200" style="s2">engage in shows of strength or shows of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.669" end="00:23:39.490" style="s2">dominance that they shouldn&#39;t kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.200" end="00:23:41.500" style="s2">what&#39;s coming naturalism</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.490" end="00:23:44.020" style="s2">I would think of toxic femininity in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.500" end="00:23:45.970" style="s2">another way which is the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.020" end="00:23:48.190" style="s2">men are sometimes driven to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.970" end="00:23:51.370" style="s2">others through strength dominance and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.190" end="00:23:53.860" style="s2">aggression women are often inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.370" end="00:23:56.520" style="s2">manipulate others through psychological</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.860" end="00:23:59.799" style="s2">means through manipulation through</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.520" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">insults and carrots and sticks and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.799" end="00:24:05.409" style="s2">engaging in reputational damage and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:06.700" style="s2">women have some women more than others</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.409" end="00:24:08.830" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s huge individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.700" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">differences in this respect have a role</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.830" end="00:24:14.049" style="s2">map of everybody&#39;s relationship to them</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.429" style="s2">who owes them what and you see this kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.049" end="00:24:17.049" style="s2">of thing I would call that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.429" end="00:24:18.909" style="s2">other side of the coin of toxic</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.049" end="00:24:21.460" style="s2">femininity which is this desire to</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.909" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">control others and you could see some</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.460" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">ideological changes for example this</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:29.620" style="s2">desire that there would be parity in</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:31.900" style="s2">every different scientific domain as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.620" end="00:24:35.049" style="s2">way of actually engaging a manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.900" end="00:24:37.000" style="s2">that will improve the law of women so</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.049" end="00:24:39.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think maybe the other side</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:41.380" style="s2">of the coin toxic femininity this you</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.159" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">know desire to manipulate things to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.380" end="00:24:46.500" style="s2">one&#39;s own end especially in close social</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:49.030" style="s2">relationships and it seems that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.500" end="00:24:50.590" style="s2">like even that definition that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.030" end="00:24:52.360" style="s2">discussion feels quite countercultural</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.590" end="00:24:53.980" style="s2">at the moment but there isn&#39;t much of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.360" end="00:24:56.500" style="s2">discussion about it in the media or in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.980" end="00:25:00.220" style="s2">in the culture at large why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.500" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">that is well you can it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.220" end="00:25:05.169" style="s2">spin I&#39;m engaging in dominance against</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">you and aggressiveness against you as in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.169" end="00:25:09.190" style="s2">this is for your own good but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:11.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of ways to spend other</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.190" end="00:25:13.179" style="s2">kinds of psychological manipulation as</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.049" end="00:25:14.590" style="s2">this is actually the best thing for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.179" end="00:25:16.299" style="s2">culture this is the best thing for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.590" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">in-group this is the best thing for</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.299" end="00:25:22.179" style="s2">people&#39;s relationships with it on</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:24.280" style="s2">another so if you look at therapy</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.179" end="00:25:25.480" style="s2">culture in that men should be more</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.280" end="00:25:25.870" style="s2">revealing of their weakness and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.480" end="00:25:27.429" style="s2">vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.870" end="00:25:29.710" style="s2">and they should talk out their problems</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.429" end="00:25:32.529" style="s2">more often for example that is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.710" end="00:25:34.120" style="s2">saying men you could be better and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.529" end="00:25:36.669" style="s2">happier and more psychologically healthy</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.120" end="00:25:38.710" style="s2">if you engaged in this thing another way</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.669" end="00:25:41.890" style="s2">of thinking about it is actually a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.710" end="00:25:43.299" style="s2">of trying to whittle away at the ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.890" end="00:25:45.580" style="s2">that men feel most comfortable engaging</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.299" end="00:25:48.100" style="s2">with the world and engaging socially</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.580" end="00:25:50.470" style="s2">right you&#39;ve had there&#39;s a very easy way</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.100" end="00:25:52.150" style="s2">to put a positive spin on it and if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.470" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">had a very cynical view about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.150" end="00:25:56.230" style="s2">actually happening in the culture then</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:58.149" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously easy to turn that on you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.230" end="00:26:00.190" style="s2">and say that you&#39;re misogynist or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.149" end="00:26:02.350" style="s2">your anti-feminist in a way that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.190" end="00:26:04.330" style="s2">not easy to turn on somebody who says</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.350" end="00:26:06.279" style="s2">aggressiveness is bad which people tend</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.330" end="00:26:08.049" style="s2">to agree with have you been described</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.279" end="00:26:10.390" style="s2">designs like feminists i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.049" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">described as an as a feminist yeah and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.390" end="00:26:15.340" style="s2">think i&#39;ve even described as engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">casual misogyny which I like better than</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.340" end="00:26:20.230" style="s2">formal misogyny you know can wear your</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.850" style="s2">sweatpants I&#39;m what did you make of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.230" end="00:26:26.679" style="s2">when it happened why why did it happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.850" end="00:26:29.649" style="s2">and what did you make of it yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.679" end="00:26:31.450" style="s2">been called an anti-feminist I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.649" end="00:26:34.390" style="s2">mean the kinds of things that people</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.450" end="00:26:37.570" style="s2">hurl at you and then having him in an ad</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.390" end="00:26:38.830" style="s2">hominem way I don&#39;t really think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.570" end="00:26:43.179" style="s2">them very much they&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.830" end="00:26:44.140" style="s2">sophisticated criticisms so I I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.179" end="00:26:45.700" style="s2">that as an evolutionary psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.140" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">generally because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.700" end="00:26:49.090" style="s2">controversial field and because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:52.179" style="s2">worked on some controversial problems I</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.600" end="00:29:40.350" style="s2">basically said James d&#39;amore is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.340" end="00:29:41.630" style="s2">factually correct about most of his</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:12.680" style="s2">relate to that and I basically said we</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.020" end="00:30:15.530" style="s2">as a society have to choose do we censor</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.860" end="00:30:29.450" style="s2">to expect sometimes they will get it</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.710" end="00:30:32.420" style="s2">wrong or there&#39;ll be a little tone deaf</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.450" end="00:30:35.630" style="s2">or you know maybe they&#39;ll be a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.420" end="00:30:37.580" style="s2">bit over systematizing in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.630" end="00:30:41.390" style="s2">well this is what the facts say so these</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.580" end="00:30:44.990" style="s2">are policy implications the response to</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.520" end="00:31:07.040" style="s2">the public sphere and I think all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.270" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">you know all the ass because in the tech</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.040" end="00:31:14.840" style="s2">industry heard that message loud and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:16.490" style="s2">clear and some of them were like to hell</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.710" end="00:31:36.710" style="s2">around sex differences around these kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.260" end="00:31:39.710" style="s2">of topics I think what you see in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.710" end="00:31:41.929" style="s2">media consensus is a generation of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.710" end="00:31:44.870" style="s2">journalists who are denied any access to</p>

<p begin="00:31:55.669" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">they&#39;re getting indoctrinated into a</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">think is natural that they think is the</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:11.179" style="s2">everything and when they encounter</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.179" end="00:32:17.899" style="s2">the same beliefs they&#39;re kind of shocked</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.990" end="00:32:20.029" style="s2">yeah you know and the irony is what</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.899" end="00:32:24.919" style="s2">these people learn in communications and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.029" end="00:32:27.350" style="s2">journalism is concepts like hegemony</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.919" end="00:32:29.210" style="s2">where like here&#39;s how you run a society</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.350" end="00:32:32.090" style="s2">you instill certain ideological beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.210" end="00:32:34.039" style="s2">and the elites and then those take over</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.090" end="00:32:38.570" style="s2">and those are the unquestioned wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.039" end="00:32:43.340" style="s2">and they&#39;re enacting exactly that theory</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.570" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">of social control without even realizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.340" end="00:32:51.169" style="s2">that they&#39;re this sort of witless</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:53.740" style="s2">accomplices to that and how do you train</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.169" end="00:32:53.740" style="s2">your boyfriend</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.820" end="00:33:00.870" style="s2">easily know how do i train my boyfriend</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.370" end="00:33:03.750" style="s2">well but kind of how to turn your</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.870" end="00:33:05.929" style="s2">boyfriend idea is the idea that women</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.750" end="00:33:08.700" style="s2">actually have this faculty</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.929" end="00:33:10.289" style="s2">psychologically with figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.700" end="00:33:12.299" style="s2">other people find reinforcing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.289" end="00:33:14.429" style="s2">punishing and doling out those rewards</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.299" end="00:33:16.650" style="s2">and punishments in a way that works in</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.429" end="00:33:19.500" style="s2">their own best self-interest both of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.650" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">women and with men and the idea there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.500" end="00:33:24.900" style="s2">that men have actually been less</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:27.330" style="s2">inclined to develop the sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.900" end="00:33:29.280" style="s2">psychological means with which to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.330" end="00:33:31.020" style="s2">control others and control their</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.280" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">relationships because they had a simpler</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.020" end="00:33:36.570" style="s2">mechanism at their disposal which was</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">basically physical force and so yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.570" end="00:33:41.669" style="s2">idea is essentially that women find this</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:44.010" style="s2">very easy to do to use rewards and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.669" end="00:33:45.330" style="s2">punishments to control others but that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.010" end="00:33:47.580" style="s2">they actually should be thinking more</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.330" end="00:33:49.350" style="s2">consciously about what they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.580" end="00:33:51.179" style="s2">get out of their relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.350" end="00:33:52.260" style="s2">other people and if you&#39;re unwilling to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.179" end="00:33:53.789" style="s2">admit to yourself that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.260" end="00:33:55.650" style="s2">manipulative then you&#39;re going to meet</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.789" end="00:33:58.669" style="s2">even you&#39;re going to be manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.650" end="00:34:00.870" style="s2">others in ways that you don&#39;t want and</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.650" end="00:40:55.119" style="s2">because it means you they&#39;re not in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.690" end="00:40:59.130" style="s2">position to distinguish between what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.119" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">actually evidence-based and real versus</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.130" end="00:41:03.700" style="s2">what pretends to be evidence-based and</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.630" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">you study and teach is right at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.910" end="00:41:15.009" style="s2">center of the culture war at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:17.049" style="s2">what do you have a sense of what a place</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.009" end="00:41:18.549" style="s2">of integration looks like is it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.049" end="00:41:20.259" style="s2">accepting that we have differences but</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.549" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">also knowing that we can change them or</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.259" end="00:41:24.279" style="s2">that we have the ability to repurpose</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:26.500" style="s2">the hardware what&#39;s the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.279" end="00:41:28.779" style="s2">integration beyond the culture wall I</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.500" end="00:41:30.730" style="s2">think before we get to a point of</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.779" end="00:41:32.890" style="s2">integration there has to be a period of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.730" end="00:41:37.850" style="s2">radical experiment</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.890" end="00:41:39.650" style="s2">it&#39;s 2019 nobody has any idea what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.850" end="00:41:41.960" style="s2">hell we&#39;re doing in terms of what a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.650" end="00:41:45.980" style="s2">viable relationship will look like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.960" end="00:41:48.050" style="s2">could last until 2050 or 2070 or however</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.980" end="00:41:51.170" style="s2">long we&#39;ll live if we get regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.050" end="00:41:54.950" style="s2">medicine nobody has any idea we know</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.170" end="00:41:56.900" style="s2">lifelong monogamous marriage probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.950" end="00:41:59.480" style="s2">works okay for some people but not</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.900" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">everybody right we know polyamory works</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.480" end="00:42:04.520" style="s2">for some people but not everybody we</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:06.260" style="s2">know whatever hot wifing and swinging</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.520" end="00:42:11.240" style="s2">works for some people but not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.260" end="00:42:15.260" style="s2">I think we need to just cut everybody a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.240" end="00:42:17.120" style="s2">lot of slack and sort of say let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.260" end="00:42:20.870" style="s2">allow eat each of these little</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.120" end="00:42:23.330" style="s2">subcultures to flourish and each of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.870" end="00:42:25.490" style="s2">needs to be like radically honest about</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.330" end="00:42:28.730" style="s2">what are the pros and cons of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.490" end="00:42:31.250" style="s2">they&#39;re doing how generalizable is it to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.730" end="00:42:33.230" style="s2">everybody else what can we what are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.250" end="00:42:40.190" style="s2">lessons learned from these different</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.230" end="00:42:42.920" style="s2">things and so I guess I&#39;m quite humble</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.190" end="00:42:45.860" style="s2">about I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna work in</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.920" end="00:42:49.610" style="s2">the 21st century but nobody else does</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.860" end="00:42:52.580" style="s2">either and I think we just have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.610" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">experiment we don&#39;t know how human</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.580" end="00:42:58.790" style="s2">nature is actually going to interact</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">with social media and smartphones and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.790" end="00:43:05.330" style="s2">contraception and modern education and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:10.700" style="s2">modern careers and you know vast cities</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.330" end="00:43:13.910" style="s2">and all that stuff so I think everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.700" end="00:43:18.140" style="s2">should be pretty cautious about like</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.910" end="00:43:20.390" style="s2">preaching to others like I love Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.140" end="00:43:22.010" style="s2">Peterson huge respect to him but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.390" end="00:43:24.410" style="s2">think he should be going around saying</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.010" end="00:43:25.610" style="s2">well we should all be monogamous geez</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.410" end="00:43:28.070" style="s2">just because it worked for a few</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.610" end="00:43:29.450" style="s2">thousand years well yeah it worked under</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.070" end="00:43:34.010" style="s2">conditions that are radically different</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.450" end="00:43:36.230" style="s2">from today some aspects that will still</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.010" end="00:43:37.970" style="s2">work some of it might not some of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.230" end="00:43:40.730" style="s2">might need minor tweaking some of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.970" end="00:43:41.930" style="s2">might need complete rethinking we</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.730" end="00:43:44.330" style="s2">actually don&#39;t really pay that much</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.930" end="00:43:45.240" style="s2">attention to other polyamorous people</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.330" end="00:43:46.440" style="s2">because we</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.240" end="00:43:50.220" style="s2">think that a lot of what other</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.440" end="00:43:51.480" style="s2">polyamorous people endorse is actively I</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.220" end="00:43:53.160" style="s2">actually don&#39;t understand how people do</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.480" end="00:43:54.990" style="s2">polyamory without an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.160" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">perspective for example and that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.990" end="00:43:58.290" style="s2">something that we&#39;re planning on</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.680" style="s2">exploring more and writing and videos</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.290" end="00:44:00.680" style="s2">yeah</p>
