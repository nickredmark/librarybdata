<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:12.059" style="s2">what my childhood ended in loss with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.019" end="00:00:14.429" style="s2">ending of Christianity in my life when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.059" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">started to question the infallibility of</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.429" end="00:00:18.750" style="s2">the Bible in the gospel and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:22.439" style="s2">make logical sense of it and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:24.060" style="s2">allowed to question it I had not been</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.439" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">allowed to question expecting to take it</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.060" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">on faith made me not be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">faith in it and so this deep important</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:39.629" style="s2">part of me this truth I held very</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:42.480" style="s2">strongly to fellow--a and that was huge</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.629" end="00:00:44.460" style="s2">and I started to cling much more</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.480" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">strongly to logic and science and make</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.460" end="00:00:49.620" style="s2">sure that I was never duped never found</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">out something I held so true would be</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">made false so I just never held anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">so true and if I did it was based on</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:01:00.780" style="s2">logic and science and even then 99.9%</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">certain my adolescence was very</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.780" end="00:01:04.549" style="s2">different than my childhood because</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">unlike my childhood where I went to</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.549" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">seven different elementary schools I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:10.830" style="s2">went to the same junior high school for</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:12.420" style="s2">three years that then funneled into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.830" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">high school that all of those junior</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.420" end="00:01:15.930" style="s2">high kids went to so I went effectively</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">I went to school with the same kids for</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">six years but my friendship group</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">changed every year and a half to two</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">years I can trace a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:28.680" style="s2">experiences I had the guys I dated and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">the friends that I was friends with</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.680" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">people I ended up being best friends</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">with to this one event that I went like</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:36.170" style="s2">on a Tuesday night we went to him</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:39.270" style="s2">because it was cheap movie night and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.170" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">afterwards this group of thirteen girls</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">that went to a movie we weren&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">friends we were kind of acquaintances</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">and it was a bunch of friends together</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:48.450" style="s2">but having gone to McDonald&#39;s after if I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been there we wouldn&#39;t have met</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.450" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">these two groups of guys who became one</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:54.689" style="s2">group became like the love of my life</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">and one of my best friends married one</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.689" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">of the guys and one of the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:02:00.210" style="s2">had like a unrequited love thing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:03.329" style="s2">the third one and then the other group</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.210" end="00:02:05.610" style="s2">became what was a few guys that I dated</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.329" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">as well as my best friend who may be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">necklace and is no longer on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:14.409" style="s2">and so it&#39;s weird to all the trace so</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:17.890" style="s2">much of what happens to you back to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.409" end="00:02:20.620" style="s2">event including I went on a German</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.890" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">exchange it&#39;s changed with a German</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.620" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">exchange student so I went to Germany</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:25.090" style="s2">and she came here during my grade 11</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:26.230" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.090" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">which I&#39;m going to talk about in my next</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.230" end="00:02:32.799" style="s2">video on travel but when I came back my</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:35.319" style="s2">friend group had changed and my best</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.799" end="00:02:37.090" style="s2">friend I had to choosing to my two best</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.319" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">friends and the one that I chose had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.090" end="00:02:42.459" style="s2">new group of girlfriends and I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.239" end="00:02:43.690" style="s2">friends really and so that&#39;s who we hang</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.690" end="00:02:48.280" style="s2">grade 12 which was also characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.269" end="00:02:50.470" style="s2">me falling in love with her brother who</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.280" end="00:02:52.209" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t be with because he was away</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.470" end="00:02:53.950" style="s2">at hockey but we wrote the letters back</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.209" end="00:02:57.579" style="s2">and forth to each other and then right</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.950" end="00:02:59.170" style="s2">before he got back he we weren&#39;t allowed</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.579" end="00:03:01.060" style="s2">to start dating my best friend said it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.170" end="00:03:02.829" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t okay and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.060" end="00:03:06.010" style="s2">like I&#39;m done I&#39;m done with this small</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.829" end="00:03:08.769" style="s2">town bs and I moved to Vancouver where</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.010" end="00:03:09.959" style="s2">my sister and dad were already already</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.769" end="00:03:12.970" style="s2">living but one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.959" end="00:03:14.859" style="s2">characteristics of my adolescents as</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.970" end="00:03:18.579" style="s2">well as like holding on to this logic</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.859" end="00:03:21.430" style="s2">was discovering that I was intelligent I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.579" end="00:03:22.810" style="s2">was told to go into remedial math</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.430" end="00:03:25.569" style="s2">because I couldn&#39;t possibly handle</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.810" end="00:03:27.609" style="s2">regular mainstream math so between grade</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.569" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">9 junior high and high school grade 10 I</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.609" end="00:03:34.150" style="s2">chose to go into the remedial and when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:37.540" style="s2">was there I got like 99% in all of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.150" end="00:03:39.400" style="s2">of the tests which I think if I had been</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.540" end="00:03:41.380" style="s2">put into regular math I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.400" end="00:03:43.419" style="s2">necessarily gotten 99% so I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.380" end="00:03:44.980" style="s2">have felt intelligent I would have just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.419" end="00:03:46.750" style="s2">been probably a C student but because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.980" end="00:03:49.030" style="s2">was an A student it somehow made me</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.750" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">realize I could be and was an A student</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.030" end="00:03:53.859" style="s2">in everything I got a is throughout high</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:55.090" style="s2">school having gotten definitely not is</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.859" end="00:03:57.430" style="s2">in junior high and not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.090" end="00:03:58.810" style="s2">and it was kind of because this person</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:01.989" style="s2">underestimated me and told me to go into</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.810" end="00:04:03.849" style="s2">this did I then ended up realizing I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.989" end="00:04:05.169" style="s2">intelligent and like I said I got</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.849" end="00:04:09.010" style="s2">straight A&#39;s in school which is why I</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.169" end="00:04:11.230" style="s2">was able to go on to University and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.010" end="00:04:12.849" style="s2">why like the fact that my biology</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.230" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">teacher was one of my favorite teachers</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.849" end="00:04:19.329" style="s2">she was just amazing taking physics</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:21.729" style="s2">writing horrible stories in the back</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.329" end="00:04:21.910" style="s2">with my friends and then AC net like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.729" end="00:04:23.910" style="s2">night</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.910" end="00:04:26.200" style="s2">before I would go in and get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.910" end="00:04:28.120" style="s2">understand what was gonna be on the test</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.200" end="00:04:32.710" style="s2">ace the test and then like forget it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.120" end="00:04:34.030" style="s2">after and I didn&#39;t take chemistry which</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.710" end="00:04:35.560" style="s2">is the third science that was offered</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.030" end="00:04:38.770" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t take calculus because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.560" end="00:04:41.770" style="s2">thought that it was a I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.770" end="00:04:43.390" style="s2">like calculating I thought it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.770" end="00:04:45.850" style="s2">counting in my head it was a counting</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.390" end="00:04:48.790" style="s2">and so I didn&#39;t take it but what I did</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.850" end="00:04:50.230" style="s2">take I was good at and it made me feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.790" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">intelligent and because I felt</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.230" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">intelligent I was able to get straight</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:57.330" style="s2">A&#39;s so I feel like my adolescence</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:05:03.540" style="s2">started with the falling away of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.330" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">Christianity and ended when I moved out</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.540" end="00:05:08.950" style="s2">from right after high school when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:11.530" style="s2">moved to Vancouver because of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.950" end="00:05:13.300" style="s2">heartbreak and pursuing like my dream of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.530" end="00:05:19.320" style="s2">going to university but also very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.300" end="00:05:19.320" style="s2">leaving this small-town mentality behind</p>
