<p begin="00:00:16.949" end="00:00:24.329" style="s2">the meaning crisis so last time we took</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">a look the theory of Schwartz and sharp</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.329" end="00:00:30.450" style="s2">and that was an important theory for</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:32.160" style="s2">linking wisdom to virtue and positive</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.450" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">psychology and we saw the deep</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:37.610" style="s2">connections between wisdom and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">cultivation and practice of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.610" end="00:00:42.379" style="s2">we made some criticisms of Schwartz and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">sharp I argued that they should include</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.379" end="00:00:46.290" style="s2">Sophia and not just for nieces if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:49.200" style="s2">remember those they were invoking</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.290" end="00:00:51.810" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s two notions of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">giving priority to phronesis I think you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.810" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">need both as Aristotle argued Sophia and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">phronesis in order to be virtuous I also</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">argued that their attempt to explain</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">four nieces with expertise I think it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:12.079" style="s2">was confused and we should put that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">aside and then we took from that some</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.079" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">ideas about the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">developmental aspect that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">central to Aristotle remember he brought</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">the developmental dimension to wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:29.219" style="s2">how much wisdom is becoming a virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">person other things I think are lacking</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.219" end="00:01:32.069" style="s2">in the theory and we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">this you know there wasn&#39;t much</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.069" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">discussion about the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:40.529" style="s2">wisdom and meaning in life but we then</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:42.569" style="s2">passed to taking a look at a theory that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.529" end="00:01:44.849" style="s2">took very seriously the connection</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.569" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">between wisdom and virtue and this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.849" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">the seminal theory work of Alton Thunder</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:54.779" style="s2">we took a look at the idea of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">heuristics pragmatics right for</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.779" end="00:02:00.569" style="s2">orchestrating mind and virtue in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:03.869" style="s2">excellence and they talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.569" end="00:02:05.729" style="s2">fundamental pragmatics of life I pointed</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.869" end="00:02:08.190" style="s2">out to you that a way making sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.729" end="00:02:10.649" style="s2">conjointly of the invocation of Medicare</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.190" end="00:02:14.849" style="s2">sticks and both senses of pragmatics is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.649" end="00:02:17.880" style="s2">this idea of that it&#39;s core to wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.849" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">this capacity for relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.880" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">obviously improved in some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:24.150" style="s2">way which i think means that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:26.540" style="s2">integral connections between wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.150" end="00:02:28.159" style="s2">intelligence via</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.540" end="00:02:31.250" style="s2">the notion of rationality that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.159" end="00:02:33.290" style="s2">already been developing together and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.250" end="00:02:35.480" style="s2">then we took a look at the five criteria</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.290" end="00:02:38.390" style="s2">there was clear indications of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.480" end="00:02:40.310" style="s2">propositional knowledge procedural</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:42.439" style="s2">knowledge the contextualism I argued can</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.310" end="00:02:46.010" style="s2">be best be seen as perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.439" end="00:02:47.629" style="s2">I argued against their I their notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.010" end="00:02:51.400" style="s2">relativism and argued instead for</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.629" end="00:02:56.810" style="s2">humility and fallibilism and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.400" end="00:02:59.209" style="s2">obviously I I think that&#39;s sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.810" end="00:03:02.690" style="s2">that that was maybe too harsh them I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.209" end="00:03:04.849" style="s2">think it&#39;s pretty clear that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.690" end="00:03:06.769" style="s2">seminal figures of wisdom fingers from</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.849" end="00:03:09.549" style="s2">the past were not moral relativist or</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.769" end="00:03:12.829" style="s2">relativists in any significant way so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.549" end="00:03:15.950" style="s2">strongly recommend replacing relativism</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.829" end="00:03:18.650" style="s2">with fallibilism and humility and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.950" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">finally the fifth criteria is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.650" end="00:03:25.220" style="s2">wisdom is applicable to domains in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">there is uncertainty and of course as</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.220" end="00:03:30.139" style="s2">I&#39;ve already argued that a huge aspect</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.099" style="s2">of our life and our cognition because of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.139" end="00:03:33.919" style="s2">ill-defined and this combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.099" end="00:03:35.780" style="s2">explosion etc etc which again means</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.919" end="00:03:38.269" style="s2">relevance realization is being strongly</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.780" end="00:03:42.530" style="s2">presupposed I want to give you some</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.269" end="00:03:48.290" style="s2">further quotes to indicate what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.530" end="00:03:50.049" style="s2">on about that so they talk about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.290" end="00:03:52.930" style="s2">having to do with generativity</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.049" end="00:03:55.010" style="s2">flexibility and efficiency in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.930" end="00:03:57.650" style="s2">application and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.010" end="00:04:00.260" style="s2">generativity and put the flexibility but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.650" end="00:04:02.569" style="s2">also the efficiency are bringing</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.260" end="00:04:03.650" style="s2">together many of the ideas that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.569" end="00:04:05.449" style="s2">been talking about with relevance</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.650" end="00:04:07.459" style="s2">realization they talk about it taking</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.269" end="00:04:18.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s taking place within a framing</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.280" end="00:04:21.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s taking place within the</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.010" end="00:04:31.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a notion of rationality deeply</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.159" end="00:04:35.750" style="s2">talk about highly calm these are all</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.310" end="00:04:37.700" style="s2">quotes I&#39;m giving you by the way highly</p>

<p begin="00:05:01.430" end="00:05:06.890" style="s2">as a case of unbounded rationality so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.390" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">think it&#39;s pretty clear from all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.890" end="00:05:11.150" style="s2">those quotes that they are directly</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.620" end="00:10:03.820" style="s2">each other you need a process theory you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.110" end="00:10:06.400" style="s2">need a theory and this is what I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.820" end="00:10:08.380" style="s2">the ancient theories of wisdom are you</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.400" end="00:10:10.030" style="s2">basically are what you&#39;re getting is an</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.380" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">account that works something like this</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.030" end="00:10:12.940" style="s2">in a process theory you have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:16.930" style="s2">independent account of what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.940" end="00:10:20.500" style="s2">foolishness right and what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.930" end="00:10:22.120" style="s2">flourishing and then when a process</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.500" end="00:10:24.990" style="s2">Theory tells me is how I could overcome</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.120" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">foolishness and how I can afford</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.990" end="00:10:33.400" style="s2">flourishing and then from that it tries</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:35.380" style="s2">to derive what wisdom is and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.400" end="00:10:38.530" style="s2">this is a very important thing to do to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.380" end="00:10:40.470" style="s2">try and figure out what wisdom is from</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.530" end="00:10:43.380" style="s2">an account of how one becomes wise</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.470" end="00:10:46.210" style="s2">because first of all it taps into this</p>

<p begin="00:10:52.780" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">of and secondly it does something that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.430" end="00:11:01.300" style="s2">think is much clearer than what a</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.300" end="00:11:06.190" style="s2">which is it picks up on the central</p>

<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:50.980" style="s2">important</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.459" end="00:16:12.819" style="s2">relationship to virtue and Keeks makes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.980" style="s2">very important distinction between</p>

<p begin="00:16:32.010" end="00:16:36.990" style="s2">Delta is pointing to is of course that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.710" end="00:16:41.100" style="s2">wisdom has to do more with this so</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.990" end="00:16:43.860" style="s2">descriptive knowledge is basically your</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.100" end="00:16:47.160" style="s2">knowledge that you know the cat is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.860" end="00:16:50.790" style="s2">mammal your knowledge that the cat is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.160" end="00:16:52.920" style="s2">predator or something like that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.790" end="00:16:57.620" style="s2">interpretive knowledge is your ability</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.920" end="00:17:05.160" style="s2">right to grasp of the significance of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.620" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">your descriptive knowledge now that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.160" end="00:17:08.370" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be important because</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:11.610" style="s2">that actually turns out to be a central</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:14.430" style="s2">feature and most of the theories that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.610" end="00:17:18.050" style="s2">are now being developed about what</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.430" end="00:17:21.180" style="s2">with what understanding is and how it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.050" end="00:17:23.850" style="s2">differs from knowledge and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.180" end="00:17:26.100" style="s2">our Delta is pointing to here by</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.850" end="00:17:28.800" style="s2">invoking Keeks notion of interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.100" end="00:17:33.810" style="s2">knowledge right is the centrality of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.800" end="00:17:35.940" style="s2">understanding to wisdom and of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.810" end="00:17:38.070" style="s2">grasping the significance is putting us</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.940" end="00:17:39.570" style="s2">I&#39;m going to argue later that this of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.070" end="00:17:41.610" style="s2">course is going to be have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.570" end="00:17:44.040" style="s2">Const rule and this is going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.610" end="00:17:48.150" style="s2">do about of course with relevance</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.040" end="00:17:52.340" style="s2">relevance realization now I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.150" end="00:17:52.340" style="s2">very important work and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.110" end="00:18:01.240" style="s2">I think the fact that there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.320" end="00:18:03.190" style="s2">happening in this theories and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.240" end="00:18:05.590" style="s2">is it&#39;s happening in a very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.190" end="00:18:07.710" style="s2">concise fashion so let&#39;s gather what</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.590" end="00:18:09.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve got here we we we&#39;ve got their</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.710" end="00:18:11.290" style="s2">realization that we shouldn&#39;t be just</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.880" end="00:18:13.450" style="s2">talking about having knowledge about</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.290" end="00:18:15.340" style="s2">wisdom we should be going through the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.450" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">process of self transcendence by which</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.340" end="00:18:21.970" style="s2">we become wise that that involves right</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:23.380" style="s2">as I said a process theory we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.970" end="00:18:26.350" style="s2">need a process Theory not just a product</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.380" end="00:18:29.110" style="s2">theory and that what the wise person has</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.350" end="00:18:30.780" style="s2">above and beyond knowledge I would call</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.110" end="00:18:32.650" style="s2">descriptive knowledge knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.780" end="00:18:34.690" style="s2">interpretive knowledge whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.650" end="00:18:36.220" style="s2">knowledge I don&#39;t know but that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.690" end="00:18:38.140" style="s2">least what many people are considering</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.220" end="00:18:39.850" style="s2">understanding and this has to do as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.140" end="00:18:41.770" style="s2">going to argue with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.850" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">that I&#39;m going to argue that grasping</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.770" end="00:18:47.350" style="s2">the significance of your knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.920" end="00:18:56.860" style="s2">you know good construal that realizes</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.350" end="00:19:00.490" style="s2">what&#39;s relevant so adult then talks</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.860" end="00:19:04.560" style="s2">about the personality characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.490" end="00:19:09.220" style="s2">that you should see in the wise person</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.560" end="00:19:11.320" style="s2">so she thinks that if we want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.220" end="00:19:12.970" style="s2">about what it is to be a wise person we</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.320" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t just be talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.970" end="00:19:17.800" style="s2">knowledge obviously we should be talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:23.410" style="s2">about the kind of characteristics that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.800" end="00:19:24.580" style="s2">the wise person has and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.410" end="00:19:27.580" style="s2">because we&#39;ve already seen the deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.580" end="00:19:31.570" style="s2">connections between wisdom and virtue so</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.580" end="00:19:34.870" style="s2">she thinks that there are three ways in</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.570" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">which we can judge the relative value we</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.870" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">can grasp the significance of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.510" end="00:19:45.640" style="s2">information there&#39;s three domains mom</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.170" end="00:19:50.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not right I don&#39;t want to say too</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.640" end="00:19:57.910" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s three dimensions of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.520" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">personhood that are crucial for being a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.910" end="00:20:04.570" style="s2">wise person she thinks there and up</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:05.980" style="s2">until now we&#39;ve been clearly giving</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.570" end="00:20:08.650" style="s2">these emphases there are cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.980" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">factors so what are the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.650" end="00:20:12.970" style="s2">factors here</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:14.230" style="s2">this of course is your ability to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.970" end="00:20:19.680" style="s2">know have a comprehension of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.230" end="00:20:19.680" style="s2">significance and meaning of information</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.340" end="00:20:28.150" style="s2">okay and and not just theoretically the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.260" end="00:20:30.070" style="s2">significance of the information for your</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.150" end="00:20:33.810" style="s2">development for your going through a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.070" end="00:20:39.660" style="s2">process of self transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.810" end="00:20:43.000" style="s2">becoming a wise person then there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.660" end="00:20:48.280" style="s2">reflective and I think the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.000" end="00:20:50.350" style="s2">here that this is picking up a bit on</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.280" end="00:20:53.290" style="s2">the the way rationality has this</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.350" end="00:20:55.330" style="s2">reflective component into it as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.290" end="00:20:57.820" style="s2">to intelligence which is just your</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.330" end="00:21:00.790" style="s2">ability to grasp what&#39;s relevant so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.820" end="00:21:01.990" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s something that can</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.790" end="00:21:04.300" style="s2">be integrated quite well with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.990" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">discussion we had on rationality so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.300" end="00:21:10.600" style="s2">reflective factors a person who has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:14.560" style="s2">cultivating wisdom is multi perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.600" end="00:21:15.730" style="s2">they&#39;re capable excuse me I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.560" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with my throat they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.730" end="00:21:19.870" style="s2">capable of engaging in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:22.330" style="s2">perspectives they&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.870" end="00:21:27.210" style="s2">self-examination self awareness self</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.330" end="00:21:29.800" style="s2">insight so notice again that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.210" end="00:21:31.900" style="s2">reflection here has an existential</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.800" end="00:21:34.680" style="s2">import you&#39;re taking these perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.900" end="00:21:37.450" style="s2">but you cannot ultimately write</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.680" end="00:21:40.090" style="s2">internalize this perspective of ability</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.450" end="00:21:43.980" style="s2">onto yourself in self reflection self</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.090" end="00:21:47.170" style="s2">examination itself insight so I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.980" end="00:21:49.690" style="s2">that&#39;s very valuable and then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.170" end="00:21:51.910" style="s2">affective component and I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.690" end="00:21:54.580" style="s2">because our dealt clearly thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.910" end="00:21:56.710" style="s2">these three are mutually influencing</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.580" end="00:21:59.110" style="s2">mutually constraining causally</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.710" end="00:22:02.410" style="s2">interacting with each other so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.110" end="00:22:06.070" style="s2">affective dimension she talks about in</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.410" end="00:22:09.790" style="s2">terms of compassion I&#39;ve made a case</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.070" end="00:22:11.050" style="s2">that so because of some of the model</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.790" end="00:22:13.390" style="s2">she&#39;s invokes from Buddhism I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.050" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">think this is inappropriate I&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.390" end="00:22:19.140" style="s2">case that the the the capacity for agape</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:22.180" style="s2">is the best way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.140" end="00:22:22.980" style="s2">compassion the main idea here is and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.180" end="00:22:25.020" style="s2">this is why</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.980" end="00:22:28.950" style="s2">invoking agape as opposed to either file</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.020" end="00:22:30.419" style="s2">Leah or eros is because it helps to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.950" end="00:22:31.650" style="s2">overcome ego centrism</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.419" end="00:22:33.929" style="s2">and you can see how these two are</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">it to her theory because what agape</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.890" end="00:24:18.179" style="s2">gives is it at least gives a way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:20.040" style="s2">trying to talk about meaning in life the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.179" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">way Wolfe talked about and I argued that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.040" end="00:24:25.740" style="s2">agape helps us to get that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:27.809" style="s2">connectedness and caring that is right</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.740" end="00:24:29.070" style="s2">it&#39;s so central to grounding meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.809" end="00:24:31.230" style="s2">life you don&#39;t have to ground meaning in</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.559" end="00:24:50.429" style="s2">right and caring and so the this allows</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.049" end="00:24:53.460" style="s2">well what it affords and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.429" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">enables our adults theory to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.460" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">connect her account of wisdom to meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:25:00.150" style="s2">in life in a in a much more direct</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:03.690" style="s2">fashion that connection to meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.150" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">life is not clear in Bolton&#39;s doneger</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.690" end="00:25:10.020" style="s2">and and if you remember wolf argues that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:11.610" style="s2">you can&#39;t reduce meaning in life to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.020" end="00:25:13.620" style="s2">morality so the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.610" end="00:25:17.309" style="s2">wisdom and virtue while central and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.620" end="00:25:19.370" style="s2">being discussed well by Schwartz and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.309" end="00:25:22.679" style="s2">sharp and by bolts and started her is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.370" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">right not reducible to it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.679" end="00:25:27.450" style="s2">sufficient for the connection between</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.440" end="00:25:38.460" style="s2">thinking about wisdom and so the process</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.460" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">aspects are dealt is doing a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.280" end="00:25:48.030" style="s2">with about connecting wisdom to meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:57.299" style="s2">in life and I think that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.030" end="00:26:01.110" style="s2">important okay so you know this is sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.299" end="00:26:03.870" style="s2">of understanding in a sense I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.110" end="00:26:08.820" style="s2">hope develop later right but the disc</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.870" end="00:26:11.970" style="s2">did this ability to pick up on what you</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.330" end="00:26:22.679" style="s2">allows you to I would argue ultimately</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.850" end="00:26:30.809" style="s2">connected to your reflective capacity to</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.809" end="00:26:37.950" style="s2">could be linked to the stuff we saw with</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.620" end="00:26:39.480" style="s2">Grossman&#39;s work and Ian Berlin Berg the</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.040" end="00:26:48.830" style="s2">perspective and ultimately turn that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.870" end="00:26:51.649" style="s2">back on oneself in self-examination</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.830" end="00:26:53.929" style="s2">lies it right in self insight and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.649" end="00:26:57.740" style="s2">those two are also linked to something</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.929" end="00:26:59.240" style="s2">like a capacity for agape and I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.740" end="00:27:02.140" style="s2">argue that you need these two for</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.240" end="00:27:04.250" style="s2">overcoming ego centrism and it also I</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.140" end="00:27:05.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen Monica develop this very</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.250" end="00:27:07.490" style="s2">explicitly in connection especially with</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.960" end="00:27:10.220" style="s2">Wolf&#39;s work but there&#39;s the real</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.490" end="00:27:11.990" style="s2">potential here of connecting wisdom to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.220" end="00:27:13.730" style="s2">something other than virtue it should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.990" end="00:27:16.130" style="s2">connected to virtue but it should also</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.730" end="00:27:20.870" style="s2">be importantly connected to meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.130" end="00:27:24.909" style="s2">life what are some of my criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.870" end="00:27:28.490" style="s2">our delts work well it it clearly</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.909" end="00:27:30.380" style="s2">invokes transformational processes it</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.490" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really incorporate a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.380" end="00:27:36.019" style="s2">transformative experience or an account</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">of it you know like like we have in LA</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.019" end="00:27:41.570" style="s2">Paul&#39;s work it doesn&#39;t really give us a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:43.639" style="s2">processing theory it points towards that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.570" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">and this is important it points towards</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.639" end="00:27:48.620" style="s2">the need for a processing theory but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give us an account of what that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.620" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">process looks very much like and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:57.769" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have an independent account of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">foolishness it doesn&#39;t really tell us</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.769" end="00:28:01.429" style="s2">very much what foolishness is and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:04.429" style="s2">something needed if we&#39;re gonna I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.429" end="00:28:06.769" style="s2">argue to have a good process theory of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.429" end="00:28:12.279" style="s2">wisdom there is an untapped potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.769" end="00:28:14.179" style="s2">this isn&#39;t so much a criticism as as</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.279" end="00:28:16.700" style="s2">encouragement that there&#39;s an untapped</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.179" end="00:28:19.669" style="s2">potential given this theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.700" end="00:28:21.580" style="s2">machinery of connecting wisdom to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.669" end="00:28:23.630" style="s2">meaning in life in a way that</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.630" end="00:28:30.110" style="s2">wisdom and and virtue so I think these</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.710" end="00:28:36.649" style="s2">are all some very important features</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.110" end="00:28:38.269" style="s2">about this I&#39;ve already indicated you</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.649" end="00:28:40.460" style="s2">know grasping the significance I think</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.460" end="00:28:46.370" style="s2">already talked a lot about agape and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:48.649" style="s2">relationships I tried to draw between it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.370" end="00:28:50.029" style="s2">and relevance realization and of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.649" end="00:28:52.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve already indicated this is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.029" end="00:28:54.860" style="s2">in the recursive aspects is bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.490" end="00:28:57.049" style="s2">prospective or knowing and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.860" end="00:28:59.419" style="s2">there&#39;s also at least in the background</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.049" end="00:29:01.020" style="s2">sense the participatory knowing because</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.530" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">how the theory of wisdom is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.380" end="00:29:27.630" style="s2">building up it&#39;s becoming more complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:29.970" style="s2">it&#39;s bringing in different aspects you</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.290" end="00:29:48.780" style="s2">I would argue also and the reflective</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.660" end="00:29:59.820" style="s2">an important role and we can see how</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.519" end="00:31:16.169" style="s2">psychology of wisdom to pedagogy he gets</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.610" end="00:31:18.649" style="s2">right again something that is important</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.169" end="00:31:21.690" style="s2">in central and we see it crucially in</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.649" end="00:31:23.490" style="s2">the ancient theories of wisdom it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.690" end="00:31:25.169" style="s2">so clearly present in the current</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.490" end="00:31:27.419" style="s2">psychological theories but the deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.169" end="00:31:30.419" style="s2">connection between wisdom and teaching</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.419" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">that&#39;s of course clearly the case in</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.419" end="00:31:34.590" style="s2">Socrates it&#39;s clearly the case in Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.940" end="00:31:36.899" style="s2">of Nazareth it&#39;s clearly the case in</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.590" end="00:31:38.490" style="s2">Buddhism that they&#39;re like in the work</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.899" end="00:31:41.490" style="s2">of the Buddha that there&#39;s a deep</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.490" end="00:31:45.389" style="s2">and so he&#39;s been very tireless not only</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.590" end="00:31:47.970" style="s2">sort of theoretically pointing out that</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.340" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">and so for many reasons</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.730" end="00:32:08.789" style="s2">Sternberg is a pivotal figure in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:10.049" style="s2">wisdom into the wisdom I hope it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.789" end="00:32:12.860" style="s2">call the wisdom industry that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.049" end="00:32:15.990" style="s2">like an industry for producing wisdom in</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.860" end="00:32:17.700" style="s2">the community of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.990" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">endeavoring to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.700" end="00:32:23.220" style="s2">psychological cognitive scientific even</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:24.659" style="s2">neuro scientific theory of wisdom there</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.220" end="00:32:26.120" style="s2">are some people who are pursuing this</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.659" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">beak suggest our</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.120" end="00:32:29.510" style="s2">other people are pursuing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:30.980" style="s2">neuroscientific aspects but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.510" end="00:32:33.890" style="s2">going to go into that in great detail</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.980" end="00:32:36.890" style="s2">right now I&#39;m just trying to concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.890" end="00:32:38.390" style="s2">on the psychological theories precisely</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.890" end="00:32:41.630" style="s2">because they are the ones that are most</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.390" end="00:32:45.159" style="s2">directly accessible and relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.630" end="00:32:50.270" style="s2">trying to respond to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.159" end="00:32:51.799" style="s2">so in 1998 Sternberg he had an earlier</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.270" end="00:32:53.960" style="s2">theory where he was talking and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.799" end="00:32:55.100" style="s2">come back to this many times he has a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.960" end="00:32:56.630" style="s2">book where he tries to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.100" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">relationships between intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.630" end="00:33:03.950" style="s2">wisdom and creativity and I&#39;m trying I</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:05.419" style="s2">tried to follow that out but you know in</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.950" end="00:33:07.700" style="s2">my own way trying to show you the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.419" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">relationships between intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.700" end="00:33:13.399" style="s2">rationality wisdom insight etc so</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:20.809" style="s2">definitely influenced by Sternberg in</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.399" end="00:33:26.120" style="s2">that way but he he then came up with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.809" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">more I&#39;d oh I don&#39;t I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.120" end="00:33:28.940" style="s2">complementary of the newer theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:30.169" style="s2">without being completely dismissive of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.940" end="00:33:32.659" style="s2">the older I would say the newer theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.169" end="00:33:35.210" style="s2">is sort of more coherent more tightly</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.659" end="00:33:37.399" style="s2">integrated more explicate &#39;add so in</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.210" end="00:33:39.590" style="s2">1998 he came up with what he&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.399" end="00:33:41.029" style="s2">and maintained a balance theory of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.590" end="00:33:43.549" style="s2">wisdom that&#39;s actually the title of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.029" end="00:33:46.250" style="s2">1998 article a balance theory of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.549" end="00:33:53.690" style="s2">so the notion of balance is going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.250" end="00:33:57.230" style="s2">play a crucial role in this theory now</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.690" end="00:34:01.399" style="s2">what he Sternberg starts by talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.230" end="00:34:03.590" style="s2">about sophia and phronesis and a paestum</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.399" end="00:34:05.750" style="s2">epistle me which is at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.590" end="00:34:07.909" style="s2">epistemological that&#39;s that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.750" end="00:34:09.980" style="s2">would call propositional knowledge he</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.909" end="00:34:12.169" style="s2">calls it scientific understanding he</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.980" end="00:34:14.750" style="s2">quickly dropped that as not being</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.169" end="00:34:17.179" style="s2">particularly relevant to wisdom not</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.750" end="00:34:19.339" style="s2">because knowledge is unimportant because</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.179" end="00:34:20.899" style="s2">everybody knows the centrality of</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.339" end="00:34:23.149" style="s2">knowledge to wisdom that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.899" end="00:34:25.490" style="s2">spending so much time on getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.149" end="00:34:27.800" style="s2">knowledge in this course but everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.490" end="00:34:30.470" style="s2">pretty much also understands that wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.800" end="00:34:32.659" style="s2">is something above and beyond scientific</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.470" end="00:34:34.669" style="s2">theoretical propositional knowledge okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.659" end="00:34:36.710" style="s2">so that that&#39;s sort of easily</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.669" end="00:34:39.220" style="s2">understandable he also like I said he</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.710" end="00:34:39.220" style="s2">invokes</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.309" end="00:34:43.700" style="s2">Sophia and talks about a sort of contact</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.139" end="00:34:45.889" style="s2">connection with contemplation and from</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.700" end="00:34:48.200" style="s2">esis and practical wisdom he zeroes in</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.889" end="00:34:50.329" style="s2">like Schwartz and sharp on phronesis I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.200" end="00:34:53.450" style="s2">think that&#39;s again a little bit too much</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.329" end="00:34:57.829" style="s2">of a neglect of the important role of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.450" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">Sophia he also draws on polanyi&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.829" end="00:35:01.539" style="s2">of tacit knowledge remember we talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:07.789" style="s2">about that when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.539" end="00:35:10.539" style="s2">subsidiary awareness and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.789" end="00:35:12.470" style="s2">the the the tacit knowledge having</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.539" end="00:35:14.059" style="s2">having to do with our procedural</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.470" end="00:35:16.849" style="s2">abilities it&#39;s relevant to attaining</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.059" end="00:35:20.089" style="s2">goals it&#39;s not explicitly taught we</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.849" end="00:35:22.339" style="s2">experience it intuitively so he&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.089" end="00:35:24.190" style="s2">he is invoking all kinds of important</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.339" end="00:35:31.069" style="s2">aspects about implicit learning</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.190" end="00:35:35.240" style="s2">intuition and procedural knowing I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.069" end="00:35:38.780" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s good I think he needs to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.240" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">also add to that Tecna what what are</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.780" end="00:35:42.799" style="s2">some important psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:45.079" style="s2">especially since I can I think in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.799" end="00:35:47.359" style="s2">fairness say that he is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.079" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">engineer such micro technologies in his</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">pedagogical endeavors I also think he</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:58.670" style="s2">needs to try to do what Aristotle did</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:01.720" style="s2">which is integrate how phronesis which</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.670" end="00:36:05.000" style="s2">is largely happening in an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.720" end="00:36:08.839" style="s2">intuitive sort of s1 kind of fashion is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.000" end="00:36:13.010" style="s2">integrated with Sophia which can have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.839" end="00:36:16.279" style="s2">more reflective perhaps more s2 aspect</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.010" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">to it all right that being said what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.279" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">the core theory well the idea is we and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:27.619" style="s2">this is important because it&#39;s just sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:30.740" style="s2">of directly invoked right he invoked the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.619" end="00:36:35.480" style="s2">the the the tacit knowledge is is also</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.740" end="00:36:40.799" style="s2">right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.480" end="00:36:42.569" style="s2">it&#39;s used as a way of because he starts</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.799" end="00:36:45.690" style="s2">talking about it as tacit understanding</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.569" end="00:36:48.359" style="s2">so the the tacit knowing the tacit right</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.690" end="00:36:50.670" style="s2">the implicit learning it is also a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.359" end="00:36:52.710" style="s2">in which Sternberg tries to invoke the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.670" end="00:36:55.950" style="s2">capacity for understanding now that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.710" end="00:37:00.599" style="s2">isn&#39;t very well explicate &#39;add in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.950" end="00:37:03.420" style="s2">account I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m trying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.599" end="00:37:07.500" style="s2">speculating that what I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.420" end="00:37:09.270" style="s2">trying to get at is that the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.500" end="00:37:14.520" style="s2">by which we sort of grasp the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.270" end="00:37:17.490" style="s2">significance of our knowledge and use it</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.520" end="00:37:21.000" style="s2">to directly and intuitively cope with</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.490" end="00:37:24.089" style="s2">the world is a significant component of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.000" end="00:37:27.230" style="s2">understanding so I think that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.089" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">shift is there he then talks and the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.230" end="00:37:32.849" style="s2">the reason why I want to invoke that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:37.579" style="s2">because the what the tacit understanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.849" end="00:37:41.609" style="s2">is doing its again so pregnant with</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.579" end="00:37:46.170" style="s2">aspects of relevance realization because</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.609" end="00:37:48.630" style="s2">he talks about the understanding guiding</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.170" end="00:37:53.039" style="s2">our ability to adapt to listen to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.630" end="00:37:56.069" style="s2">language to adapt to situations to shape</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.039" end="00:37:58.170" style="s2">them and that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.069" end="00:38:00.390" style="s2">physical it can mean how we construe</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.260" end="00:38:22.980" style="s2">not as the same thing as theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.480" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">knowledge he&#39;s picking up on the same</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.070" end="00:38:56.410" style="s2">of insight and so we can see again the</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.970" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">his theory involves quote views let me</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.790" end="00:39:10.990" style="s2">start that again his theory quote views</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:13.300" style="s2">who is &#39;dom as inherent in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.990" end="00:39:16.380" style="s2">interaction between an inventor and an</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.420" end="00:39:25.090" style="s2">in fact he then goes on to say wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.130" end="00:39:27.850" style="s2">depends on the fit of a wise solution to</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.090" end="00:39:29.980" style="s2">its context so notice the fitted Ness</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.850" end="00:39:32.080" style="s2">right all of the language that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.980" end="00:39:34.360" style="s2">developed is being directly invoked is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.080" end="00:39:37.150" style="s2">being put at the center of the theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.360" end="00:39:38.740" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna argue that what he&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.150" end="00:39:40.860" style="s2">what he what he&#39;s invoking when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.740" end="00:39:44.440" style="s2">invoking balance is he&#39;s invoking</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.860" end="00:39:46.120" style="s2">optimization and of course argued that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.440" end="00:39:55.300" style="s2">relevance realization is an optimization</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.120" end="00:40:00.580" style="s2">theory so what&#39;s sort of beautiful about</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.300" end="00:40:05.110" style="s2">the theory is he gives a mattock diagram</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.580" end="00:40:10.540" style="s2">of it and draw this for you so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.110" end="00:40:14.020" style="s2">our tacit understanding that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.540" end="00:40:15.490" style="s2">implicit processing etc remember we</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.020" end="00:40:20.100" style="s2">talked about that so much in connection</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.490" end="00:40:20.100" style="s2">with flow and</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.790" end="00:40:38.410" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is it is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.880" end="00:40:39.940" style="s2">trying to balance your interests balance</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.410" end="00:40:42.970" style="s2">your interests what you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.940" end="00:40:45.400" style="s2">what you find salient important and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.970" end="00:40:47.590" style="s2">talks about three kinds there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.400" end="00:40:50.080" style="s2">intrapersonal the interpersonal and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.590" end="00:40:58.840" style="s2">extra personal so this of course is</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.080" end="00:41:00.970" style="s2">interest between people this is interest</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.840" end="00:41:03.270" style="s2">within a person so you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.970" end="00:41:05.340" style="s2">Plato here trying to get your various</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.270" end="00:41:09.720" style="s2">centers and what they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.340" end="00:41:09.720" style="s2">coordinated together and extra personal</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.530" end="00:41:18.610" style="s2">having to do I think this is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.260" end="00:41:20.530" style="s2">how you&#39;re connected to yourself how</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.610" end="00:41:22.120" style="s2">you&#39;re connected to other people and how</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.530" end="00:41:23.830" style="s2">you&#39;re connected to the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.120" end="00:41:26.500" style="s2">I think he&#39;s invoking at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.830" end="00:41:29.320" style="s2">implicitly the the three dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.500" end="00:41:31.870" style="s2">connectedness that go into meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.320" end="00:41:34.030" style="s2">life and so I think at least implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.870" end="00:41:36.940" style="s2">we could make a clear argument here that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.030" end="00:41:42.370" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to connect wisdom to meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.940" end="00:41:44.320" style="s2">in life okay and that this capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.370" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">sort of zeroing in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.320" end="00:41:49.150" style="s2">information is playing an important role</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:51.550" style="s2">in that and the reason why I say that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.150" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s not clear to me why the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.550" end="00:41:55.300" style="s2">arrows only going one way it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:55.690" style="s2">that I well this is a criticism I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.300" end="00:41:57.580" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.690" end="00:41:59.380" style="s2">I think the arrows right should go both</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.580" end="00:42:01.960" style="s2">ways because there&#39;s a there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.380" end="00:42:03.550" style="s2">going to be feedback but anyways they</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.960" end="00:42:06.610" style="s2">feed forward to the three things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.550" end="00:42:12.180" style="s2">are clearly I would argue RR which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.610" end="00:42:15.180" style="s2">right the adapting the shaping and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.180" end="00:42:15.180" style="s2">selecting</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.790" end="00:42:21.450" style="s2">I&#39;ll come back to that notion the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.380" end="00:42:24.030" style="s2">triangles are meant to indicate balance</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.450" end="00:42:25.890" style="s2">and I&#39;ve tried to indicate to you that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.030" end="00:42:28.050" style="s2">think I&#39;ll put that down here and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.890" end="00:42:37.350" style="s2">come back to it the balance has to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.050" end="00:42:41.880" style="s2">with optimization okay so what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.350" end="00:42:45.390" style="s2">on here is right this is a balance of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.880" end="00:42:49.080" style="s2">your response to write the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.390" end="00:42:52.020" style="s2">context so this is balancing your</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.080" end="00:43:00.660" style="s2">interests and this is balancing your</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.020" end="00:43:04.280" style="s2">response okay like I said that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.660" end="00:43:09.630" style="s2">clear our relevance realization stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.280" end="00:43:13.100" style="s2">this then is directed towards he argues</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.630" end="00:43:13.100" style="s2">the common good</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.500" end="00:43:19.910" style="s2">here again is where I have to step aside</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.950" end="00:43:28.020" style="s2">from the value he&#39;s articulating and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.410" end="00:43:30.180" style="s2">theory he&#39;s generating I agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.020" end="00:43:33.690" style="s2">especially within a liberal democratic</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.180" end="00:43:36.570" style="s2">framework framework deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.690" end="00:43:41.670" style="s2">Christianity that the common good is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.570" end="00:43:44.580" style="s2">overarching value for us I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.670" end="00:43:48.180" style="s2">that that is going to be universally</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.580" end="00:43:54.060" style="s2">shared by all people who I think can</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.180" end="00:43:57.480" style="s2">reasonably be deemed wise individuals so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.060" end="00:43:59.550" style="s2">if you&#39;re in a culture that&#39;s firm what</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.480" end="00:44:02.310" style="s2">this means maybe you have to bend this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.550" end="00:44:04.650" style="s2">so much then if it&#39;s then trivial it</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.310" end="00:44:06.869" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean maybe it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.650" end="00:44:10.350" style="s2">common in the sense of shared by</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.869" end="00:44:12.630" style="s2">everyone it might be you know you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.350" end="00:44:13.980" style="s2">in some sort of hierarchical feudal</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.630" end="00:44:17.190" style="s2">society and the common good</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.980" end="00:44:19.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t that everybody equally benefits</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.190" end="00:44:21.510" style="s2">from it it might be more than or that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.800" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">you know everybody is working well</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.510" end="00:44:25.830" style="s2">together some sort of justification like</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:27.990" style="s2">that I&#39;m not trying to justify a</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.840" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">I want you clearly to understand I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.180" end="00:44:35.440" style="s2">this is an important value I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:37.810" style="s2">concerned here that Sternberg is being</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.440" end="00:44:40.030" style="s2">anachronistic here and he&#39;s using one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.810" end="00:44:42.670" style="s2">our central values and attributing it to</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.530" end="00:44:55.300" style="s2">in Jesus or the Buddha not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.150" end="00:44:57.820" style="s2">it&#39;s the case for Marcus Aurelius and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.300" end="00:45:01.270" style="s2">all of the Stoics it&#39;s clearly not the</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.270" end="00:45:07.720" style="s2">about putting that up there I I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.740" end="00:45:10.030" style="s2">advise that there&#39;s something I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.720" end="00:45:12.340" style="s2">more more broadly comprehend I think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.030" end="00:45:14.530" style="s2">things that we should put up here are</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.340" end="00:45:19.620" style="s2">things that there&#39;s already a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.530" end="00:45:21.730" style="s2">on a broader notion of virtue oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.620" end="00:45:25.150" style="s2">that really makes it sound like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.730" end="00:45:27.430" style="s2">making an emphasis here that what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.540" end="00:45:45.370" style="s2">think and meaning in life okay I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:47.380" style="s2">changed that is not in his model I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.370" end="00:45:50.100" style="s2">changed it because of again I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.380" end="00:45:52.450" style="s2">that his particular term is</p>

<p begin="00:46:09.670" end="00:46:19.240" style="s2">pointing so trying to interpret what</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.710" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">the way it&#39;s operating is unclear it</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.670" end="00:46:52.690" style="s2">might be something as basic as the wise</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.720" end="00:47:04.450" style="s2">not that not that interesting a claim</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.940" end="00:47:06.970" style="s2">because wisdom is itself a normative</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.450" end="00:47:09.059" style="s2">notion and therefore the fact that the</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.450" end="00:47:38.200" style="s2">argue and I think what these triangles</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.200" end="00:47:47.829" style="s2">is the the balance is used to adapt to</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:27.490" style="s2">deeply integrated well with a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.950" end="00:48:57.250" style="s2">meaning in life because as I said I</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.690" end="00:48:58.510" style="s2">think this is pretty clearly how you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.250" end="00:48:59.530" style="s2">connect to yourself how do you connect</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.510" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">to others how do you connect to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.530" end="00:49:06.490" style="s2">world right there&#39;s important possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:09.849" style="s2">connections possibly it&#39;s I&#39;m unsure</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.490" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">between this and virtue and meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.849" end="00:49:16.450" style="s2">life so this is all very good and like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:18.940" style="s2">said overall this is clearly a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.450" end="00:49:22.900" style="s2">optimization and it&#39;s invoking something</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.940" end="00:49:26.410" style="s2">very much like relevance realization all</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.900" end="00:49:27.309" style="s2">right what are some of criticism that on</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.410" end="00:49:31.119" style="s2">the board for now what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.309" end="00:49:34.180" style="s2">criticisms of Sternberg this is still in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.119" end="00:49:40.210" style="s2">the end a product theory it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.180" end="00:49:43.630" style="s2">process theory it doesn&#39;t make this sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.210" end="00:49:45.640" style="s2">of I mean this avoids equating wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.630" end="00:49:49.299" style="s2">with expertise and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.640" end="00:49:51.700" style="s2">powerful advantage of this theory but</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.299" end="00:49:53.890" style="s2">there like I said this this domain the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.700" end="00:49:57.700" style="s2">values unexploited it you could either</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.890" end="00:50:00.130" style="s2">be a somewhat trivial because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.700" end="00:50:01.750" style="s2">almost tautological that the wise person</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.130" end="00:50:03.790" style="s2">is acting according to normative</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.750" end="00:50:06.040" style="s2">standards or it could be a much more</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.790" end="00:50:08.920" style="s2">controversial claim that specific values</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.040" end="00:50:11.260" style="s2">are involved I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve already</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.220" end="00:50:18.430" style="s2">is the goal of all wise people that</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.010" end="00:50:22.930" style="s2">seems anachronistic to me an important</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.430" end="00:50:25.089" style="s2">way the theory could clearly be improved</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.930" end="00:50:29.230" style="s2">by getting clearer about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.089" end="00:50:32.579" style="s2">tacit implicit learning getting clearer</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.230" end="00:50:35.020" style="s2">about optimization getting clearer about</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.579" end="00:50:37.089" style="s2">relevance realization getting clearer</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.020" end="00:50:40.809" style="s2">about how relevance realization connects</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.089" end="00:50:42.940" style="s2">to meaning in life so all of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.809" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">things would be developed the if one</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.940" end="00:50:47.619" style="s2">started to develop a process theory and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:49.750" style="s2">not just a product theory so Sternberg</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.619" end="00:50:51.250" style="s2">needs an independent theory of with</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.750" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">foolishness now he has a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.250" end="00:50:55.180" style="s2">foolishness but it&#39;s not independent his</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:58.690" style="s2">theory of foolishness is basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.180" end="00:51:00.819" style="s2">foolishness is an imbalance in these</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.690" end="00:51:03.339" style="s2">things so what foolishness is is</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.819" end="00:51:05.260" style="s2">basically a lack of wisdom and again</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.339" end="00:51:06.520" style="s2">while that&#39;s definitiely the case what</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.260" end="00:51:08.590" style="s2">you need is an</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.520" end="00:51:10.300" style="s2">gently constructed theory of wisdom a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.590" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">theory sorry a theory of foolishness you</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.300" end="00:51:15.730" style="s2">think media theory of foolishness that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:17.830" style="s2">takes in hand right the centrality of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.730" end="00:51:19.960" style="s2">seeing through illusion and into reality</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.830" end="00:51:21.850" style="s2">that has an independent account of how</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.960" end="00:51:24.130" style="s2">we&#39;re self-deceptive our self</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.850" end="00:51:26.290" style="s2">destructive how that operates how that</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.130" end="00:51:28.870" style="s2">unfolds because we see that in many of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.290" end="00:51:33.370" style="s2">the ancient wisdom theories and how we</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.870" end="00:51:38.020" style="s2">can ameliorate that so I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.370" end="00:51:45.790" style="s2">that is missing in an essential way from</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.020" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">Sternberg&#39;s work ok so I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.790" end="00:51:52.660" style="s2">end what I want to do is try and draw</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:55.360" style="s2">all of these together I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.660" end="00:51:58.600" style="s2">indicate important points of improvement</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.360" end="00:52:00.040" style="s2">one one from one theory with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.600" end="00:52:02.790" style="s2">the other relative strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.040" end="00:52:06.100" style="s2">weaknesses I&#39;ve also tried to indicate</p>

<p begin="00:52:10.500" end="00:52:16.150" style="s2">in this course because that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.910" end="00:52:18.250" style="s2">the big plausibility diagram to show how</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.150" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">the machinery of relevance realization</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.910" end="00:52:39.010" style="s2">to give a processing theory so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:46.080" style="s2">take that up and the next account oh and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.010" end="00:52:46.080" style="s2">I&#39;m somewhat hesitant about that because</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.070" end="00:52:54.280" style="s2">you know I I&#39;m sort of okay with you</p>

<p begin="00:52:54.280" end="00:52:58.390" style="s2">not I mean I&#39;m very cautious about</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.150" end="00:53:08.080" style="s2">tried to make arguments for that and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:53:08.080" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">that I have made with Leo Ferraro about</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.820" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">wisdom but there it is something you it</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">borders on hubristic to talk about this</p>

<p begin="00:53:20.990" end="00:53:28.490" style="s2">at least show you a plausible way in</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.000" end="00:53:30.290" style="s2">which we can draw all of this material</p>

<p begin="00:53:35.450" end="00:53:40.370" style="s2">subject that theory at least the version</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.700" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">that was published in 2013 to some</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.370" end="00:53:47.060" style="s2">important criticisms and and then</p>
