<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">really kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:49.600" style="s2">feature of other sites to add</p>

<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">crowdsourced rating system for</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.160" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">uh products communities</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">and politicians etc etc etc anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">else you&#39;d ever want to have the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">rate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">also rating features so if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">politician do they</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">have the same values that you do and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:20.479" style="s2">you as a user can go in um say the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">features</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.479" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">or attributes that you want to you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">weigh all the different attributes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">say what&#39;s important to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:30.079" style="s2">and then the system would kind of match</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">you up and show you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.079" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">how everyone or every system or every</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">rates based upon your values</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">so that&#39;s the um i&#39;ve written up</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">a document about that and did some extra</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">wording</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">so every time i mention it i get</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">contacted by someone else</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:53.680" style="s2">i guess i&#39;m going in too long of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">update but</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that&#39;s the other project</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">uh there&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:01.040" style="s2">who&#39;s who works with a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">community groups and they&#39;re small</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.040" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">so they want a way to match people up to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">groups and you know some groups are</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">full of extroverts that want to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">of chatting some people want to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">right down to business so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:13.280" style="s2">having the ability to find a group that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">matches your</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.280" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">your desires would be helpful and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">that tool can be used for that as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">uh and then working with adriel</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">eventually on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">some sort of uh sharepoint not</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:32.080" style="s2">sharepoint</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">what&#39;s the salesforce plugins and i</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">application builder is they have a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">marketplace for plugins</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">so that&#39;d be interesting because it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">evolving space they don&#39;t have it yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">where you can charge for your plugins</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">they&#39;re just free but they&#39;re that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">the works for them to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">billing platform and stuff so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">of like the wordpress</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">marketplace um but it&#39;s in a new new and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">emerging space which is often where um</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">some money gets made so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">i can think of that&#39;s where i&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">cool i can go next uh so my project</p>

<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">platform to fight misinformation in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">politics science and news</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">uh i&#39;ve been working with someone else</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">who very well might be showing up in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2">10 to 20 minutes uh named matush</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">we have a prototype online uh i&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.840" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">to get the new version of the prototype</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">this weekend um where we will be adding</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">the legislation tracker</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">and then the next part is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">tracking the actual content</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">um which for now we&#39;ll just be tracking</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">the content of how we knew about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">legislation so it won&#39;t be terribly</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">but uh sort of hopefully in the next two</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">or three</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">feature releases things will start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">come together and it&#39;ll actually start</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">make sense and be useful um but as it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">right now it&#39;s not terribly useful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">got pick data and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">really enough features actually do do</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">anything um</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually coming along quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">quite nicely so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">and then in the near future uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">it&#39;ll be sort of cloned and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">different version of it will be online</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">under the name conferati</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">which will specialize in tracking</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">information about organizations</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been uh i&#39;ve had a dream for doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">a project trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">fix problems that i see in social media</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">and doing a social media project</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">that will</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">kind of work for the users a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:10.319" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">or a lot better than kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.319" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">the big tech what they have given us to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">um is i don&#39;t think it&#39;s any longer in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">our interest</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">um especially the way that it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">extra addictive</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">um so that&#39;s that&#39;s been the dream</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">that&#39;s been the plan</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">so um my update</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">a university uh because yeah this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">this is in software</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.160" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">and app development i can&#39;t develop an</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">app i was trying for a while to get a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">team</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">my story okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">i assume that there are other</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">universities that have a program like</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">um so this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">through university of michigan um and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">i live um i live nearby</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">so uh what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a year-long senior</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">project and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">uh let&#39;s see they they take about</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how many submissions come</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">in but</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">um they said typically</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">they will accept about 12 to 14</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">project submissions um for a year</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">and they said basically what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">um you have to give a pitch they you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">do an audio</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">pitch or a powerpoint presentation or</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">um or or a video pitch</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">and the students</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">they have some kind of autonomy with how</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">they decide</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">what project they want to work on which</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">i&#39;m learning about this i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">learned that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">very good because you want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">excited about the topic essentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">uh the hard part was when i</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">was developing the app when i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">designing the app that i want to develop</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">kind of just with an idea phase</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">i basically felt like i came up with all</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">i was like okay here&#39;s all the problems</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">that i see here&#39;s how i&#39;m gonna address</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">um in this program you aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">come up with any of the solutions i had</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">to change my whole pitch deck</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">around um because my original pitch deck</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">was going towards investors</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">or programmers that wanted to help me</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">out so i was like here&#39;s the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">and they explained you don&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">to come up with the solution</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">uh you only get to define the problem as</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">good as you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">now doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re working you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:13.279" style="s2">the students are in a vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">you&#39;re still working with them you i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.279" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">see what it&#39;s like you know you may get</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">to prod them a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">but the whole first semester the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">first fall</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">semester is only brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">they&#39;re only doing brainstorming for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">first semester</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">which yeah that&#39;ll be the first four</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">months and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">the next semester um they&#39;re still on</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">on your project and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">actually doing the development</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">um you know because it&#39;s students</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">they&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">they said you&#39;re going to get spaghetti</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">code you&#39;re not going to get the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">greatest code</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">this is for a minimum viable product um</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m basically trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">something made that then i can show</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">to either potential investors</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">or more likely i mean i&#39;m still gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">need a team</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:17.680" style="s2">are other university programs that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:21.120" style="s2">that are similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.680" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">um but i was i felt like i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.120" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">up a creek without a paddle i was i had</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">an idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">without a way to do anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:34.880" style="s2">was this wasn&#39;t my first choice because</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">well i don&#39;t i really don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">much control i&#39;ll have over</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">what solution the students come up with</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">um and it&#39;s probably a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:46.320" style="s2">in some ways because i was told because</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.320" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">explained this whole thing where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">like i think i already have what i want</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">to build</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">and i was told that you will be</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">surprised</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">these students are really really smart</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:02.720" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna come up with things</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t have even thought of um</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.720" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">and so yeah we&#39;ll see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">first i have to get accepted and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">well i&#39;m pretty confident</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">but you didn&#39;t see the contract you will</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">sign</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">when you get approved</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll see the contract yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:23.279" style="s2">i assume there will be a contract</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">between you and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.279" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">university so you get the cheap labor so</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">to speak</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">other junior students and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">i would assume that the university is</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">going to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">no not shares but um some incentive</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not only for the students to learn</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s also there must be something</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">for the university to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">you know to benefit off there doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">but in some of the programs there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of universities</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">that do</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">in the us that will do this for free</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">because they just need project ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.199" style="s2">not a lot that i know of but i do know</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">of some</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.199" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">also that like we&#39;ll we&#39;ll work with</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">businesses it&#39;s usually not the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">and then they&#39;ll they&#39;ll take have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.639" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">business come in and have the students</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">live on projects so i hadn&#39;t heard one</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">do kind of an incubation like your idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">like like that the college is doing so</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">interesting uh it&#39;s it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;ll kind of be good in a way because</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:31.360" style="s2">if you&#39;re like me you&#39;re wedded to your</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.360" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">to your solution right but but your</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">passion is about solving the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">uh also so i think it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:44.800" style="s2">experiment even if you end up not using</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">it or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.800" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">to to follow that passion space</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">i would just double check with them make</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">sure that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">you may have already asked this question</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">if it&#39;s open source or not</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">because a lot of the students would need</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">to be able to use that as a portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.839" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">um so it&#39;d be easier for them to do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">as a portfolio piece if</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">it&#39;s open source but i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">the college thinks about that they may</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">they may not they care about that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">if they can just show the photos or show</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">a functioning copy of it then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">sufficient for their portfolios</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">but yeah i think it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.959" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">yeah i was just thinking whether any of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">my projects end but yeah all mine</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">a very specific the i the i</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">yeah and you may feel this way about</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">yours too is that the um</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">the interesting part is the specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">solution that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">experimenting with now and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">because sometimes you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">state the problem in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">uh if you narrow it down like</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">instead of saying and you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">done the pitch i&#39;m sure so we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">talking for other people</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">no well i&#39;m i&#39;m doing a video pitch</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:03.919" style="s2">and i&#39;ve done a couple takes oh so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">might do it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.919" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not finalized i still have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.240" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">submit</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">i submitted a one-page paper they asked</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">which was basically defining the scope</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">like what is this going to be some huge</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">they&#39;re like this is within the size of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">the projects we take on so that was good</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">um but i have to kind of sell it well</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">i told them the uh category</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">the you know it&#39;s in social media so</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">they&#39;re like that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">um but i i haven&#39;t made the final pitch</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">which is what the students</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">are going to see to say we even like</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">this we want to take this</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">on and that they understand what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">trying to solve yeah you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">if i made the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">problem extremely specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">um i could guide it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">more yeah cause like and i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve already mentioned that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">you&#39;re not completely open to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">project yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">um but you mentioned that it&#39;s fighting</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">addiction but you could</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:09.919" style="s2">say you know uh i want to tackle these</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:09.919" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">addictive qualities so you&#39;re limiting</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">your kind of not limiting or narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">because they can always jump outside the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">box but</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">you could say this this one</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">psychological effect that they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">or these three psychological effects are</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:27.520" style="s2">the problems i want to solve so as</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">opposed to just the broader picture of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">anything addictive</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">which i think anything addictive would</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">be a more interesting thing for them but</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">you know you you have goals too um</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">so that that might be a way to to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">constructively well i&#39;ll in case anyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">else does a pitch</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">the the way that i&#39;m going about it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">this i have a friend who&#39;s in marketing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">he said go with the story he said</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">what you want to do we want to explain</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">your current experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">and how it falls apart don&#39;t get too</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">technical</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">and he said just say this is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">happens when i use social media</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">and this is where it fails and he said</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">actually use a specific example</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">say and he said that&#39;s what will help</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">people understand one of the things i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">worried about</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to put this the plan</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">currently is to put this in the pitch is</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">you know i&#39;m 34 so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">i&#39;m facebook came out my</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">freshman year of university and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">been watching social media</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">evolve and change since it started and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">the new apps that have come out when</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">from text to images to video and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:46.559" style="s2">whatever so i have like this big</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">arc of how we&#39;ve used it differently</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.559" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">and my one of my worries is that so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">going to mention that because</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">one of my worries is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">the younger folks i mean they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">seen this evolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">so when i&#39;m describing here&#39;s how i see</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">with social media currently are they</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">even gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">get it are they gonna understand what</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">i&#39;m seeing i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">yeah and that putting you know using a</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">personal story</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">and maybe a few i think if you have time</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really good advice so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">that&#39;s how i</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">support that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">i think you could mention you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">afterwards i kind of looked into it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:34.799" style="s2">it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">cognitive bias of humans that you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.799" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">if you still wanted to kind of narrow it</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">down or think all right</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">you could say i wish that i could you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">uh just have this instead of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">at near the end um</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">then that would kind of maybe direct it</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">a bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">i wish that it worked like this and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">here&#39;s the mock-ups</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">with this exact screen design by the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:07.280" style="s2">i came up with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">but some of your main main uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.280" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">theory uh hypotheses on what&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">i think you could hit that at the end</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">without being too pushy</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">yeah well i mean i&#39;m mostly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">get the i mean this is part of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how big the competition is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">i was suggested that they pick 12 to 14</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">a semester</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">and there were maybe about 20 or 22</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">submissions</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s not bad it&#39;s not too bad i</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">mostly want to sell myself i said</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">you know you&#39;re going to be working with</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">me like</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be fun and they said</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the project too is also</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">you kind of participating with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">students um they spend i mean they</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">actually took it</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">surprisingly from like a business</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">perspective like the email</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">correspondence i had at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">was like whoever the representative</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">is like essentially as if i might</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:07.520" style="s2">already be a small startup or something</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">um no we need your representatives</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.520" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">contact information etc</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">i&#39;m just going from my personal email</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">and all right fine</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">um so they had sort of a method uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">if they were talking to small business</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">uh yeah they said</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">what did they say uh something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">whoever your representative has to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">regular availability uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">they didn&#39;t get really specific but said</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">basically yeah you should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:47.360" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:49.919" style="s2">an email within 12 hours</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.360" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">essentially um sounds like there will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">zoom calls</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">they said in the past that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">someone like me would meet up with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:23:59.440" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">once in a while they said it&#39;s all going</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">and this was from the person i talked to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">that already went through the program</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">they don&#39;t want a micro manager they</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">probably seek partners still</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">if it becomes a viable business i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">heard it&#39;s not smart to do these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">of things alone</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">um so we&#39;ll see what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what else to say about my</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">you know like i&#39;ll answer questions but</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">problem they want help solving or get an</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">opinion on</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">or share more about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">pimp themselves whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">anyone got anything ajo martish</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">nothing comes to mind uh it might be</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">interesting to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">about that the the writing system</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">um if no one else</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">if no one has anything else</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:03.279" style="s2">yeah that sounds interesting so let me</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:10.559" style="s2">can i yeah hey</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:12.240" style="s2">let me share</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.559" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">so this is just kind of the working</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">document and this system</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">so some of the wording that i came up</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:20.559" style="s2">with so get your about</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">your idea is the like the tagline is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">find value</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">uh and i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">used somewhere i haven&#39;t done any</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">research but that&#39;s kind of the gist</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of ways to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">seek something like that um</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">and and actually the brand for this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">isn&#39;t that important because there will</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">be a lot of little brands they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.039" end="00:26:41.200" style="s2">conferrati</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">for the products and businesses so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">wiki election for the political stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">um so this is just like a builder for</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">and then uh the one of the the one for</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">community finding is called the vibo</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">meter</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">so you can see whether this community</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">has a good vibe for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">uh that&#39;s really interesting that&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">chico lab</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:06.640" style="s2">yeah uh so they&#39;re they&#39;re prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">that right now using miro and just kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">of having people do it manually but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">if it works out and they might want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:15.120" style="s2">build something else on it</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">so basically you can you can do a rating</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.120" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">system for</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">communities products politicians and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:20.399" style="s2">then dot dot because it can fit a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">one of the uses i want to use it for is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">for the no code</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">environment there&#39;s a lot of no code</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">tools and figuring out which ones</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">work together is very difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">you&#39;re often plugging together a front</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">end and the back end because none of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:39.120" style="s2">solutions do everything and even</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">even if they did sometimes you have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">need that gets out of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">so having a place that you can go and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">say how do these systems work together</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">and rate their individual features would</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">be good</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">uh so the main thing is a rating system</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">a review</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">site that&#39;s customizable uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">the people themselves can personalize</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">well i say personalize and categorize so</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">you&#39;ll be able to have a lot of control</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">over what you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">in the system and how you filter things</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">they can choose and wait all the factors</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">in their decisions so they</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">uh you know like i was saying earlier if</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to pick a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.679" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">a pr you know even like buying a house</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">which i was doing which this wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">useful for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">um but um you know being able to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">all the normal stuff you can do in in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">the home buying stuff or in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">amazon except</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:38.399" style="s2">also like in amazon you could say or</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">best buy or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.399" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">you can say i want the like if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:43.760" style="s2">buying</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">cords i might say a three foot cord or</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.760" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">five foot cord so they have those little</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">check boxes on the left hand side</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">but then you would also have quality</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">features and say</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">you know i want something you know high</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">quality in the cord but i don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">the ends of the cord like because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">going to just cut them off and use them</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">for something else</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a weird example and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">to be crowdsourced</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">which of course one of the big things we</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">gotta work through is how to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.720" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">people from gaming the system and just</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">filling it up with junk</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">so that&#39;d be an interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">brainstorm about right now uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">evidence base this is one little ad</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.399" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">additional features that i want but i</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know if anyone else would want so</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">say this company is bad at taking care</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">of their employees</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:30.960" style="s2">you could then attach an article in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">newspaper about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.960" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">uh you know a an online article from cnn</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">or something about it and then also</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">people can come in and say</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">maybe things that were wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">article and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">um some features that uh is also going</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">to be necessary</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">specifically in the wiki election for</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">the legislation for the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">because you may say well the politician</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">said this and then another person come</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">in and say</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">uh here&#39;s the full video and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">they took it out of contents</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">and he he said it is not before that cut</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">so he&#39;s actually saying the exact</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">opposite so having it uh evidence-based</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">would be good for that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">so having that so that&#39;s where reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:12.960" style="s2">score would fit in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">i want to be low code so in theory kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.960" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">of like wordpress or some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">systems where you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">click a button and it would deploy a</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">version that then you can customize</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">so you could label it you could say what</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">the and this is asking a lot this may</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">not be the first version but you can say</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">that the entities that i that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">rating are called politicians</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">and the politicians have legal so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">could name everything and talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">relationships and we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to figure out all these</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">relationships because it&#39;s like it who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">who owns it and then when did they own</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">it and then also</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">this company may do business with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">other company but that&#39;s not as strong</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:54.240" style="s2">as a relationship as ownership if one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:55.679" style="s2">the companies they do business</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">or they might just have a technical</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">integration with and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">they there&#39;s a relationship you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">know about because you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">building these no code systems you want</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">to know</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">what systems integrate with the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">but if one of them is a bad actor</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">has any room an integration is a low</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">kind of a low association so also</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">handling that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">hierarchy or not even hierarchy it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a graph</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">a database of all the associations and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">this is a lot of features</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">i also got to figure out where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">going to start</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">which i th which i think is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">a rating system</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">and then adding it to where you can add</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">in the different things</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">and then i think it&#39;ll be important from</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">the beginning to make it multilingual</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">um or at least have the bones in there</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">to where you can turn that on without</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">having to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">redevelopment and i don&#39;t i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">had to do that a lot in my life i know</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">it&#39;s painful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s easier um anyways so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the the main</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">pitch and then i got all these details</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:03.279" style="s2">like some use cases</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">i got some potential names which i</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t researched yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">and that would just that would be just</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">for the builder so that name</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">once again isn&#39;t that important because</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be used in advertising</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">and then i got abstraction what are we</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">going to call things</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:21.360" style="s2">entities attributes ratings you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">because you can&#39;t say politicians and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.360" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">and then just open questions and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.799" style="s2">technology wish list</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">and i have a technical architecture that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.799" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m thinking about using</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.039" style="s2">what&#39;s in here the data store mongodb</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">because you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">deploy that and azure um</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">in aws or google cloud or you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:54.559" style="s2">locally so</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">um yeah so that&#39;s what i got</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.559" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">so if anyone has any questions or</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">suggestions we can add them in and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">maybe we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">what features we want to put into to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">crowdsource safe all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">so are you envisioning that this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">going to be sort of like an entire</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know ecosystem where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">got the member accounts and sort of all</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">these pieces</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">or is it more like i don&#39;t know a module</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">or a snap and sort of like it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">reason score will end up being</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">where you can say hey you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">able to score these things based</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">on these things you can use reason score</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">for any of that it sounds similar to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:31.679" style="s2">that but</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">i was thinking of making this a full</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">so i still i would like a one click full</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">where you can host your own and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">customize it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">i would like it to be plugable to where</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">if you&#39;re technical and you&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to use</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">the mongodb authentication</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">we can it&#39;s not that hard to get in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">code would be open source and you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">switch it over something else i want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">be flexible</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">um i hadn&#39;t thought it</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">since there&#39;s so much data coming in i</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">don&#39;t i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i could make it quite like</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">reason score where it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">pluggable although reason score has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">lot of people coming in and out but</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">um so yeah one of the one of the uses</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">potentially yeah to where you can just</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">kind of paste some code in there</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">but if you do that yeah i guess we could</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">do it that way as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">but i&#39;m envisioning building it as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">whole system and then make it plugable</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">if people want</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">um but you would either have to so</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">reason score i always thought it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">like it&#39;s on someone&#39;s blog</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">and then if they wanted to edit reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">score they&#39;d have to create a second</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">login</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">so for like but for for wikilection and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">conferrati for reason score it&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">more it wouldn&#39;t it&#39;d have to be more</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">plugged in so i guess if someone wanted</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">to on their blog say</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">here are the companies i support and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">that&#39;d be an interesting use for a plug</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">yeah a little widget</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s sort of what was cause you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">mentioned both wikileaks and confrarati</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">in case of wiki election at least the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">prototype has already started so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">you know there&#39;ll be some structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">there and it&#39;ll end up doing a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">than this</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:15.760" style="s2">but this will be a very important part</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">of a lot of different areas</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.760" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">like the rating of the politicians but</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">then that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">be based on the rating of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">legislation and the events and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">all the various things under that person</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">so it kind of becomes like</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">almost both a like a data attribute and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">then a visualization tool</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m hoping to keep the code like</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">the main like important code abstracted</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">out enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">that you could use um mongodb</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">or you could use uh firebase which i</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">is what y&#39;all are using so</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">that would also be a good test to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">sure that the central code doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:55.599" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">specific technologies requirements</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">because we wouldn&#39;t want to move you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">guys out of firebase</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">and i like better it&#39;s just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">one company</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">we we might do the initial prototype and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">firebase then later port it to mongo</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">db but yeah but i hope to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">flexible so people can</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">use the the individual pieces but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">also can be deployed all together</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a high bar but you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">right yeah because the prototype forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">collection has like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">one percent of this planned right like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">very basic kind of hard-coded version</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">um but then in the relatively near</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">future that&#39;ll be one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">will end up being added so that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">might be an interesting sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">first prototype for this is like how</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">would the structure work and how would</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">that look</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">and it gets interesting where like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">would be rating</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">in this case the legislation and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:51.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve got how people vote</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">and that sort of affects what score they</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.680" end="00:36:54.160" style="s2">get like you know if a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.160" end="00:36:58.160" style="s2">is let&#39;s say good for the environment</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">well then if you vote against it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.160" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">you get that negative against you your</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">score</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">and so you&#39;re you&#39;ve got like a one</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">level of uh of rating on the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:14.000" style="s2">and then each politician has like a pool</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.839" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">of all the votes that they&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">so really you&#39;re visualizing the ratings</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:21.280" style="s2">the legislation on the politicians yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s why we&#39;ll have to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">the hierarchy also and similar to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">products and companies you know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">a company builds a crappy product you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:34.839" style="s2">want that to be seen on their</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">company page um</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.839" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">so yeah that association</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">so good okay go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:49.839" style="s2">would you rather talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.599" end="00:37:52.800" style="s2">evidence-based or</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.839" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">i i think i have a comment on evidence</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.800" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">based</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">yeah uh yeah whatever people want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">chat about</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">so what do you thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">well i guess i should find out what your</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">what you&#39;ve already thought about but</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">uh what about the ability</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">for the topic being rated</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.000" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">uh whether that&#39;s a business a person a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know uh to have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">rebuttal space because you could have</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">something that was</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">just raiding something down to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">ground and</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">the whole thing could be false um</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s some kind of uh verified</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">like you could still have the rating</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">system let&#39;s just say a company</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s getting rated</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a spot almost like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">you can add a business to google maps</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">then there&#39;s like does the company have</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:39:00.320" style="s2">anything to do with the fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">is added to google maps like a way to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.320" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like a way for the company to come</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">in and say actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.520" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">you know to defend themselves uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">actually that was false information</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">or something like that you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">this on on</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:19.040" style="s2">sites like amazon someone says hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">this product didn&#39;t work because such</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.040" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">and such and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s all true but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like the company&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:27.040" style="s2">you didn&#39;t use the product correctly you</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">know and just</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.040" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">people can take it for what it is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">know they can say i still don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">the company</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">but if i was on a rating system uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">as any person i might want a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">at least give some evidence um in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">defense</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">yeah we should uh yeah i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">would be a good feature to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">well yes so first of all in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.880" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">evidence-based feature there will be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">ability for anyone to come in</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">and say that that evidence or that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">reasoning is wrong and put their reasons</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">why and that&#39;s part of the reason score</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">thing but like you said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">there&#39;s still a value in in saying this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">is the actual</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">owner of the business or the actual</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">politician um</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">so yeah i think eventually building in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">way that people can verify</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">their accounts which is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">isn&#39;t impossible it&#39;s not that hard so</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">um like you know you could have them</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">tweet out something</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">from from there from the official</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">twitter twitter account or you can have</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">just send in an email from uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">from their domain uh there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:42.720" style="s2">different ways but yeah i think having</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:43.920" style="s2">uh let&#39;s see trying to think of where to</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.720" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">put that i don&#39;t think i want to list</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.920" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">uh right now i&#39;ll just put it up here</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">yes yeah so anything else about</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.839" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">evidence-based</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">so cool</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">so any other any other questions</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">suggestions concerns about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">where this is going anyway</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">so the most basic structure and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">um a user would start to build</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">uh the rating site from</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">this would be to define uh like</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">linguistic terms you would have nouns as</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.000" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">uh entities companies or partitions of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.000" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">some things a product</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">you would have some verbs as in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">interacts with</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">this so a connection relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">uh two all whatever how many uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:02.800" style="s2">entities and then uh this course would</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">be like</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.800" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">adjectives right something like this</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">so the most basic structure would um</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">consist of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">three different types of uh information</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">one being the the thing you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">write</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">or the relation you won&#39;t write really</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">because you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">in theory write right uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">both not only a</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:31.200" style="s2">politician but if you have two</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">politicians and they are in</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">some sort of relationship uh you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">rate that as being</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:42.240" style="s2">not very good if</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">yeah or some companies that do</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.240" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">business together and they conspire to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">do something bad together</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.880" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">the relationship is itself can be seen</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">like monopolizing some industry</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">then uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">yeah i have to think about that um</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:06.319" style="s2">so just yeah i was just trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.319" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">how would i build a site because uh i</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">can compare it to the way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">thinking that is currently behind</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">uh the newer version of quick election</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">some it&#39;s going in very similar</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">direction which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">uh the more entities and different types</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">of entities we are going to add to this</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">like there are already people um</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">um and companies</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">and uh relations between them</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">and then there is legislation and there</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">then uh relations between people</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">who voted for some legislation too fast</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">or not</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">there is this and there are more</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">entities to be added in the future</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">and then it only makes sense uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:43:58.960" style="s2">for a template to exist or something</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:02.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.960" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">um does not require hardcoded</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.400" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">uh like this legislation module</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">but a module that is used to uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">instantiate uh some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">some type of entity and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">general direction</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s going towards</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">and yeah it&#39;s a very interesting thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">uh to cv collection as uh like</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">before you have a side builder you would</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">have a site that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">built by the specific site builder so uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">like bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">type of creatine structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.839" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s an interesting exercise to think</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">about recollection as being</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">something that was potentially</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">instantiated from something</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">far more obstructed yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">yeah so have you gone down the path to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:55.119" style="s2">have instead of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">so right now you do have a a people</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.119" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">table and a legislation table well this</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">would be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">entity&#39;s taste yeah and then you would</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">just say what type of entity each entity</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.119" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">yeah which is the way we&#39;re going yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">it&#39;ll be important</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">for when we&#39;re building this to look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">the wiki election because it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">built one and see how compatible</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">we can keep it or a translation layer or</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">whatever because yeah you&#39;re right y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve already built uh some of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">just more</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">uh specifically when this is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">more general yeah and it would need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">be open because like</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">right now the idea of values they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">just columns on legislation and people</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">we&#39;re saying this legislation you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">here&#39;s six possible values it could</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">represent and then people can vote you</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">know plus or minus</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll have the vote which just</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">says you&#39;re either for or against it but</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">there&#39;s no score there</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">necessarily i think there is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">stored but it&#39;s not interact it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">using the legislation and then the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">person is meant as like a summary of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">which that does get to be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">more interesting things or in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">prototype it won&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">a big issue but when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">something like this it&#39;s like how does</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">scoring for the value actually work</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">because if it&#39;s just you know a sum then</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">you can end up with somebody with you</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">know a score of plus or minus</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">50 000 which might not be terribly</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">useful versus</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">you know if you&#39;ve only got five or ten</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">things on file somebody might have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">score of six</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">which might still be somewhat meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">is it a sum is it an average yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">you also need to know</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">like a distinction between unknown or</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">vague you know so really the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">technically accurate thing would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s a range between</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">and let&#39;s just say between zero and one</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">or it could be zero and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s between zero and one you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">have a a range say</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">so if it&#39;s very narrow range then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">know you have a lot of data</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:53.200" style="s2">and if it&#39;s a wider range it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve been working on that in the debate</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">we haven&#39;t done ranges right now the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:47:01.839" style="s2">system just uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">it&#39;s kind it&#39;s mostly an average is how</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.839" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">um the an interesting thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">is that if you only have one piece of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s true or false it could really</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">throw things off right and you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">want to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">well this is all the information we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">and this so this is this is just</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">preliminary or something so it might be</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">a certain number of things another way</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">to mathematically do it i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">the name of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">is that you start everyone off with one</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">kind of positive point one negative</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">point and so when you add</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">the third positive point it doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">shoot it up to a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:39.200" style="s2">it it shoots it up some way so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">kind of some way that that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.200" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">you take out for when you have very</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">little data</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">but i&#39;d like to keep kind of the math</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:50.079" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing where i want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">kind of keep that separate so you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.079" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">decide</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">and maybe even write some code or</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">scripts to do the calculations because</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">that will</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">be something that varies quite a bit or</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">have several different options</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">right yeah like one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">pieces that isn&#39;t really being done in</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">the prototype</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">is what happens when somebody just</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t vote for something</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">yeah in this case it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">saying set it to zero</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">but there are certain situations where</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">you might actually want to like minorly</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">affect their</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">score in one direction or another so it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">was like we didn&#39;t vote for against it</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">you were kind of useless in the process</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">so if i want somebody who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">like you know super pro environment or</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">super pro business</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">and you know you tend to vote present or</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:38.000" style="s2">you tend to you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">skip that day at work uh then that might</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.000" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">count like</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">somewhat against you yeah but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">libertarian not voting would</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">probably get you a really high score</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">for most of the stuff anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">like adding to the government you just</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">not vote um yeah yeah figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">handle that will be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">absenteeism yeah and that might end up</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">being kind of a value of the person that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">values how you value values because</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">you&#39;re saying like right what do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:06.800" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">not voting means or voting present or</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.800" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">you know taking that day off work</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:10.960" style="s2">and there are certain situations where</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">you have to right like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">of interest you&#39;re like i have to leave</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">i&#39;m yeah i i have to by law</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">okay that might actually be a pro or</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">just or or neutral</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">but there gets a lot of like the weird</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:25.839" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">minutiae when you&#39;re down in those</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.839" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">details especially for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.839" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">legislation where you&#39;re going to end up</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">with thousands of votes on you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">thousands of pieces of legislation</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s going to be a lot to chew</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">through yeah and i think that they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:40.000" style="s2">kind of like a default view</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">because most people won&#39;t be customizing</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.000" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">uh and maybe we need to even have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">crowd-sourced way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">debating what that default view should</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">be because that will be very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">but let the people get into the to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">the weeds including that level of if the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:57.839" style="s2">person didn&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">do i want to count that form against</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.839" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">them or neutral um</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">and then show the defaults and then say</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">you know this i would like to change</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">totally and one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">things when you open up the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">the the sort of the crowdsourcing what</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">the values are</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">is choosing what values are showing by</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">default because if there&#39;s you know 150</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">different values that you could be rated</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.559" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">well i probably don&#39;t want to show all</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.839" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">because you know some of them might not</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">be and i guess it might end up being</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">the things that you have the highest</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">scores in</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">so it might be different per person too</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">differentiates you from the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">politicians so maybe even if everyone</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">has high score of like ethics which</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:41.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t happen in our government</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">um then maybe you just don&#39;t show that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.760" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">one because everyone&#39;s the same so right</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">yeah and you just show the outliers well</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">you vary from the norm</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">would be interesting um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">or i mean the main thing is there might</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">be i don&#39;t know there might be an</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">overall score although i guess maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">um and then we have to kind of figure</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">out for some of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">you know the funding model will be the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">so how much do you allow without coming</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">in and creating an account</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:12.559" style="s2">how much work do you make the person go</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">through when they create an account</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.559" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">another thing is should people should</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">there be a bounty system</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">to where people can get paid for doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:24.400" style="s2">investigations</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">so like if i want to buy a new no code</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.400" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">platform and like two or three platforms</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">came online and no one&#39;s used them yet</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">maybe i can through the system say hey</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">crowdsource</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">the funding or use another external</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">system and just link to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">like there&#39;s uh anyways but where</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">you could advertise it if anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">wants to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">have someone go in and review these</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:48.839" style="s2">three systems then we pay them for this</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">and the data gets added to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.839" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.079" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if y&#39;all have answered</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">this yet</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:09.839" style="s2">but um so it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">kind of like wordpress i could i could</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.839" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">this uh platform</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">a framework essentially and i could</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">create my own and i could be like i want</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">to make the site for</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">raiding video games right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">hopefully i gain traction or maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">make it private</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">because i just want to do it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">amongst my 12</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">friends yeah and we want to have our own</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">thing or i can make it more public and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:37.839" style="s2">you know have 50 000 users or something</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.839" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">is is that an accurate assessment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:44.960" style="s2">okay exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">so one of the things that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">will you have um like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">common i don&#39;t know how to put this like</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:52:59.640" style="s2">common rating tokens like</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:02.240" style="s2">because you could have different</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.640" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">ecosystems say let&#39;s just say video</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">and by the way i love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:10.319" style="s2">raiding the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:11.760" style="s2">um but so i&#39;ve got maybe i&#39;ve got like</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.319" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">video games</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">and companies and video game characters</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">like as</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">different things in in my system</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">uh and if i make my new</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.920" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">site do i have to start from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">or maybe i want to start from scratch i</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">want to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">you know dan&#39;s rating site or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">because i&#39;ve got a different</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">viewpoint but maybe i don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">all the work on the companies i just</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.440" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">want to rate the video games but i still</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">want to show the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">can i import or can i link to</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">a master token of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">companies and so i</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">you know like a map i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">put a master wiki or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s almost like sharing data between</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">two of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">similar apps</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">is this turning into blockchain yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">mean that sort of came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s like i can create my own token</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">and be like no i want you yeah i want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">use dan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">you know his ecosystem rating system</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">because i trust him and his friends or</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:26.319" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re all whatever tech people</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">or i want to use like the imdb</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.319" end="00:54:29.680" style="s2">um system for the characters or</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.680" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">like and which where do i want to pull</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">and some will win and some will lose out</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">as it evolves over time</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:41.520" style="s2">uh have you thought about that no the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">only thing we thought about so far is</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.520" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">for both the politicians one and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">products one they&#39;ll both have companies</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">um because you&#39;ll you&#39;ll want to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">this company is lobbying this politician</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:54:58.319" style="s2">um so it would be interesting to have</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.319" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">share the company database which we</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">talked about just doing it all in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:08.319" style="s2">same system and having different views</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:10.319" style="s2">um i so i would see that as an advanced</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.319" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">possible feature if enough people kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.319" end="00:55:13.359" style="s2">of wanted it</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">of course it&#39;s always open source code</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.359" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">so you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">literally pull the database and put it</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">in there and write your own</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:22.240" style="s2">code that would keep them in sync or</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">something or</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.240" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">yeah so i hadn&#39;t thought that far down</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">the path</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.440" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s pretty high it&#39;s pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">level but i thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">yeah if i was comparing all these things</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">in these three different video game</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">maybe i want to automatically import the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:42.160" style="s2">data for companies and characters</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">but me and my friends want to have our</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.160" end="00:55:50.799" style="s2">own ratings on the games and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">how could that be decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.799" end="00:55:53.839" style="s2">you&#39;d have almost have almost like</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:56.799" style="s2">different tokens</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.839" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">uh and maybe i want to pull from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.799" end="00:56:02.079" style="s2">biggest one</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">or i like this alternate one uh better</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.079" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">one day uh a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s that it would be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">have not only open source but</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">open source code but on also open data</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">which is uh we are going to put</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">lots of effort into building a database</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:30.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">politicians and companies anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">it would be nice to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.440" style="s2">do some kind of subscript subscription</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:44.160" style="s2">or just</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.440" end="00:56:46.319" style="s2">open the data of some part of the data</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.160" end="00:56:46.319" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">rating</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">sites built by our users would be able</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:57.119" style="s2">to use the shared data</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">and have this like established</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.119" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">data that has been vetted enough and</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">considered like true enough</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">and common enough</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">so people can share and use it for their</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">own ratings if they want for example to</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">uh and uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.520" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">yeah if someone wanted to have uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:26.880" style="s2">similar similar to weak election but uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">focusing on different aspects then the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.880" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:31.839" style="s2">itself the static data of parties and</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">politicians and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.839" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">companies would be just there but</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">someone could</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">do their own view and their own like</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:42.160" style="s2">the window to the data and presented in</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">slightly different way</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.160" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">i&#39;ll present it&#39;s like from slightly</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">different different</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">angle oh yeah i think that could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">without that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">it&#39;ll end up being fairly control like i</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:55.359" style="s2">think there will be open</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">but it&#39;ll be sort of all possibly like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.359" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">control that you would use so any</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">filters you put anything that like any</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:04.559" style="s2">spin that you&#39;re putting on</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">on the data is plainly plain visible</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.559" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">so if you&#39;re saying well look at how the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">data looks if you completely ignore all</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">this evidence</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:12.160" style="s2">you might be able to do that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">plainly visible when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.160" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">the data like oh here&#39;s the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:16.319" style="s2">score if you completely ignore</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.359" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">everything that happened over the last</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.319" end="00:58:18.640" style="s2">five years</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:20.240" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a weird filter to use why</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.640" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">would you do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.240" end="00:58:24.640" style="s2">um but i think an example of what you</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">might be talking about is possibly</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.640" end="00:58:28.319" style="s2">because there&#39;s also going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">trackers like it&#39;s more a people tracker</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.319" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">as opposed to just politicians</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">so an example might be like an expert or</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">and so the end goal is hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:38.480" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:40.240" style="s2">like new sites or even facebook would</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:42.079" style="s2">have some sort of an integration that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.240" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">would say like if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.079" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">you know a news story the person that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">wrote it might have a profile so you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:49.599" style="s2">sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:50.799" style="s2">a summary on where that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.599" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">allegiances might lie</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.799" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">and previous things they&#39;ve written and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">sort of what values they have</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:58:57.760" style="s2">but then also each person discussed in</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">in the article if they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.760" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">a politician a a way for there to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">probably just be like a side panel</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">saying you know people in this article</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">and then like a summary of all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">people talked about so</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:12.079" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to go to wikilection to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">see it but you&#39;re able to use that data</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.079" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">elsewhere i think we&#39;re running out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:18.480" style="s2">time so we might go ahead and close it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">off that i really appreciate everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.480" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">feedback and participation</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">yes yeah good one</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:30.839" style="s2">i haven&#39;t seen a ravage no uh any</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">closing comments</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.839" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">nope</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.680" end="00:59:45.040" style="s2">i was going to say that ultimately uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.760" end="00:59:47.040" style="s2">given enough</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.040" end="00:59:48.640" style="s2">different rating systems and enough</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.040" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">people looking at</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:25.839" style="s2">share yeah which kind of ties into</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">yesterday&#39;s conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.839" end="01:00:29.359" style="s2">yeah if you get into organizations and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">products and even into these of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.359" end="01:00:33.119" style="s2">these supply chains you can start to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">like oh look there&#39;s no product here or</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.119" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">oh we are there&#39;s only one offering for</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">this supply chain that uses slave labor</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:41.280" style="s2">but i talked to an expert that said you</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:44.000" style="s2">could pretty easily not do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.280" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">like yeah to find the caps that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">interesting point</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">well i had a final thought uh which was</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">you know um when i was thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">having uh like a central</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">database you know here&#39;s the standard</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:02.480" style="s2">rating or you could like make your own</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:04.319" style="s2">for you and your friends or something</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.480" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">you know i just thought you know that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.319" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">might work okay for something like video</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">games or</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:13.359" style="s2">whatever but you know it</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">there might be things you might not want</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.359" end="01:01:17.760" style="s2">to allow that for</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">like politicians could be a good example</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.760" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.200" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">well there isn&#39;t a standard rating</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">and now it&#39;s like i don&#39;t know which to</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:29.839" style="s2">go to do i go to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">right wing rating you know and their</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.839" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">opinion or the left-wing one you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">um so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s tricky i think it almost depends on</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">what the</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.400" end="01:01:54.559" style="s2">eco viability um we may want</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">one uh token to look for</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.559" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">for a company</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">just a final thought yeah but to figure</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">that out</p>
