<p begin="00:00:06.560" end="00:00:12.100" style="s2">The Bible is a series of books written edited and assembled over thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.900" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">It contains the most influential stories of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.120" end="00:00:24.320" style="s2">Knowledge of these stories is essential to a deep understanding of western Culture, which is in turn vital to proper psychological health</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.760" end="00:00:28.580" style="s2">(as human beings are cultural animals ) and societal stability.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.120" end="00:00:34.020" style="s2">These stories are neither history, as we commonly conceived it, nor empirical science.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.540" end="00:00:38.780" style="s2">Instead they are investigations into the structure of Being itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:41.440" style="s2">and calls to action within that Being.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.480" end="00:00:44.400" style="s2">They have deep psychological significance</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.040" end="00:00:49.780" style="s2">Hi, everyone. I just wanted to make a quick video to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.880" end="00:00:53.400" style="s2">remind everyone or let everybody who&#39;s watching know that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.660" end="00:00:57.100" style="s2">Starting my series on the stories of the Bible.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.280" end="00:01:04.620" style="s2">The psychological significance of the stories on the Bible, on Tuesday May 16th, at the Isabel Bader Theatre in</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.940" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">Downtown Toronto, I&#39;ll put the address and everything at the bottom of the video in the description</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.820" end="00:01:14.300" style="s2">I want to delve into the biblical stories from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.300" end="00:01:19.440" style="s2">And I wanted to do it for a long time and have done it in part in my maps of meaning series</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.440" end="00:01:22.840" style="s2">But the biblical stories are</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.000" end="00:01:27.120" style="s2">What, they&#39;re canonical in relationship to the rest of our culture.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.120" end="00:01:31.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to understand western civilization itself unless,</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.000" end="00:01:33.440" style="s2">you&#39;re grounded in the biblical stories.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.820" end="00:01:37.400" style="s2">They are like a precondition for knowledge of the humanities</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.400" end="00:01:41.900" style="s2">and a knowledge of history for that matter and so I want to improve my</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.960" end="00:01:46.260" style="s2">understanding of them, and share what I&#39;m able to figure out with everybody that I can, and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.420" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">I wanted to just make a quick video to let everyone know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:54.520" style="s2">I&#39;m going to run a 12-week series, about two hours lecture per week</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.740" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">Starting May 16th and running till approximately mid-august.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">pretty much every week except a couple where I couldn&#39;t get the theater.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.620" end="00:02:08.320" style="s2">It&#39;s pretty nice theater so that would be good. I&#39;d also like to let everybody know that the videos will be taped</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.960" end="00:02:15.519" style="s2">Thanks to my patreon subscribers, and put on YouTube probably within a week or two after I initially show them</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.519" end="00:02:17.889" style="s2">As soon as we can get them edited and all of that, so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:20.980" style="s2">Anyways - there&#39;s still season tickets left</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:28.360" style="s2">That&#39;s the tickets that will allow you entrance to all of the lectures, and there are individual tickets left for each lecture as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.360" end="00:02:31.500" style="s2">And you can get those at JordanBPeterson.com</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">but as I said I&#39;ll put all the instructions and the details in the description of the video below, so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:41.740" style="s2">tune in on YouTube if you&#39;re inclined to and if you&#39;re in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.740" end="00:02:45.429" style="s2">And you&#39;d like to see them live then come down and see them live it should be really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">I hope that&#39;s the plan anyways, so, thanks a lot and hopefully we&#39;ll see you there otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.420" end="00:02:58.180" style="s2">Well, you&#39;ll see them on YouTube, and that&#39;s good, too. Thanks a lot bye-bye</p>
