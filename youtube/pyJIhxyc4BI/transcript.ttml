<p begin="00:00:00.320" end="00:00:04.720" style="s2">for me when when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.439" end="00:00:07.279" style="s2">non-theism</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.720" end="00:00:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like the question of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.279" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">objective existence of god is just the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.440" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">wrong question</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:14.000" style="s2">yes i the the core of the non-theist</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:17.119" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.000" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">is rejecting the shared so it rejects</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.119" end="00:00:20.480" style="s2">the shared presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:22.640" style="s2">of both the theists and the atheists</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.480" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">about how to best understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.640" end="00:00:25.760" style="s2">this phenomena that you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">clearly exists</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.760" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">which is the experience of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">that is really transformative of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">so right and what i think is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:37.600" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">um trying to make trying to frame this</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.600" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">in terms of the existence or</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:44.079" style="s2">non-existence of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.719" end="00:00:46.239" style="s2">a being and that it&#39;s primarily uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.079" end="00:00:47.120" style="s2">that and that the way we understand that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.239" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">is by</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.120" end="00:00:53.440" style="s2">manipulating beliefs and that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:54.800" style="s2">can sort of nail down uh get some final</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.440" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">answer about the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.800" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">appropriate symbols for that these are</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:00.640" style="s2">all things</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">right and so the theater says yes to all</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.640" end="00:01:03.920" style="s2">of those and the atheist</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">agrees that that&#39;s the right framing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.920" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">then says no to all of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">and the non-theist says no i reject that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">that framing is i think actually miss</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">the phenomena um and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">meaning that is afforded by the you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">the connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">that the phenomena is is pointing to so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">the non-theist yeah rejects that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:28.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">the non-theist says can we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">a framing that puts uh that well i once</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">described this to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">that affords us to fall deeply in love</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:39.840" style="s2">with being</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">once again this is very like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.840" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">nichian thing almost right</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s niching in some way but i</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">think it&#39;s heideggerian</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">because i mean i think the problem i</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">mean this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:52.880" style="s2">critique that he uh heidiger made of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">nietzsche that nietzsche basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.880" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">is still locked into nietzsche basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">inverts christianity</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">so he&#39;s still locked to it so i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">the atheist just</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:04.479" style="s2">inverts theism and they&#39;re still locked</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">to it and i want to break out of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.479" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the the white</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">supremacy versus white oppression</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">narrative right it&#39;s like the first way</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.879" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">a narrative that doesn&#39;t serve the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">the first response to it is just its</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">inverse yes exactly and you have to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">and break</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">past them which is what you were trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:24.080" style="s2">to talk about with your example of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">parkour</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.080" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">that neither the white supremacy or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">white oppression</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">model explains what actually emerged and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">was created in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">yeah by these kids who yeah from</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">you know yeah and you know and they had</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">an agency</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">they created this yeah yeah and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">and it works it works as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">to to bridge right</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">and i think that um i think that in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">ways like uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">it&#39;s you can almost view parkour as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">kind of analogy or</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">a potential precursor to how can we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">build these tools</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">that function it&#39;s like i um</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">you know god doesn&#39;t whether god exists</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">in a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">external metaphysical objective sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">it kind of doesn&#39;t matter because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">representation of god</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">or the meaningfulness of those things</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">has to exist for us on some level</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">yes um and if we&#39;re not addressing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">and if we can&#39;t address it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">can invite in the believers and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">non-believers</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">um then</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">then we&#39;re just stuck with war i guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">but that&#39;s why i think what&#39;s that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">i&#39;m so attracted to your project because</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">you know um as much as i love and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">respect what peterson&#39;s done he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">flirts at the edge of saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">neither</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">yeah yeah he rejects the atheism and he</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">describes christianity in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">that it&#39;d be very easy to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">non-theistic but he doesn&#39;t go to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:03:58.840" style="s2">point of saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">i&#39;m actually approaching this as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">non-theist yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">and i&#39;ve as you know i&#39;ve criticized him</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">not doing that because i think you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">make a very clear case that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">uh that young is a non-theist for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">example um</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">yeah so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">that i mean i&#39;ve been you know i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">trying to articulate this with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">notion of transactivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">and and the notion of this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">extraordinarily valuable like that just</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">blew my mind when i first</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">encountered the idea of transactivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s the object</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">there&#39;s the observer of the object and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">then there&#39;s the relationship yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">and that so much of where we get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">is reframed once you recognize that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a reality within the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s exactly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">i i i you know i&#39;ve been helped by</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">people like corban</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">and and the imaginal as not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">subjective image or just the objective</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">thing but</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">as the enacted image schema that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">actually allows us to afford</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">you know uh fine transactivity find that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">and i see a lot of like i i see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing in parkour</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">is exactly that kind of enacted imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">imaginal play i should say</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">the whole point about the metaphor we</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">we can&#39;t win by playing the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">right</p>
