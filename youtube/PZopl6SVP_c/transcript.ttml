<p begin="00:00:02.850" end="00:00:07.109" style="s2">corporations which i think is done</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.740" end="00:00:09.300" style="s2">mainly in our product app but that could</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.109" end="00:00:12.990" style="s2">be its own thing I guess let&#39;s write and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">keep track of corporations but this one</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.990" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">was actually going to be about radiant</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">and keeping track of nonprofits so</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:20.939" style="s2">people that we donate money to what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">their mission where is the money going</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:28.070" style="s2">where is it coming from I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">that there&#39;s a TED talk talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.070" end="00:00:31.859" style="s2">nonprofits and how we do need to pay the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:35.399" style="s2">CEOs more and not be so concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">the money going to top-rated talent</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.399" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">because you want top-rated talent</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:39.989" style="s2">especially in the nonprofit fields and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:41.399" style="s2">would agree with that but I also think</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.989" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">that spending a million dollars on a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.399" end="00:00:45.989" style="s2">gala that raises 1.1 million is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">ridiculous and so especially if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.989" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">not actually following your mandate and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">I give money in the Red Cross for Haiti</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">relief after they have a disaster how</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">much is going to there and what are they</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">actually doing I would like to be able</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">to keep track of that and so a nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:02.840" style="s2">and charity ratings up would be very</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:02.840" style="s2">helpful</p>
