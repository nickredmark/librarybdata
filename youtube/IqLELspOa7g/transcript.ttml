<p begin="00:00:05.010" end="00:00:10.469" style="s2">one thing is those current systems the</p>

<p begin="00:00:12.889" end="00:00:17.940" style="s2">unsustainable and unsustainable means</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">self terminating means that these</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.940" end="00:00:24.270" style="s2">systems run to their own end and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">fall off some kind of cliff right until</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.270" end="00:00:27.870" style="s2">when we look at growth curves of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.710" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">different kinds of organisms anytime we</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.870" end="00:00:31.680" style="s2">see a growth curve that has an</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">exponential up that is not forever</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.680" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">and sometimes the exponential up goes</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:39.409" style="s2">logistic and that&#39;s very nice sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:41.670" style="s2">it drops off pretty hard before it</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.409" end="00:00:44.239" style="s2">logistics sometimes it goes through a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.670" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">lot of unstability sometimes just</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.239" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">Exponential&#39;s up and then drops off a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">cliff right so we were under half a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">billion population for all of human</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:58.769" style="s2">history as far as we know until the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">Industrial Revolution and then in just</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.769" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">over two hundred years we went up to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">over seven billion people and growing</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">and that is a profound exponential</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:10.890" style="s2">population curve not only have we went</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">through this profound exponential</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.890" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">population curve in relationship to our</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">ability to extract resources from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:19.980" style="s2">planet that are not replenishing</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.980" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">Revolution was rate mining farming</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">fishing logging etc the ability to take</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">some kind of resource reserves that took</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">hundreds of millions or billions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:35.760" style="s2">years to develop and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">extract them at a radically fast pace</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.760" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">and obviously much faster than they can</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">renew and then the population is growing</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:43.890" style="s2">on that savings account until you hit</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">the ends of the savings account and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.890" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">there&#39;s real problems not only have we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">been growing in population but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:53.700" style="s2">been growing in resource consumption per</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:54.650" style="s2">capita when we think about running an</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.700" end="00:01:57.560" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.650" end="00:02:00.330" style="s2">it requires year-over-year growth</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.560" end="00:02:03.900" style="s2">requires it so that kind of exponential</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.330" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">growth economy and attached to a linear</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.900" end="00:02:07.909" style="s2">materials economy just doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:09.769" style="s2">ongoing Leon</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.909" end="00:02:12.019" style="s2">my planet right it only would work</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.769" end="00:02:15.290" style="s2">ongoingly on an infinite line field turn</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.019" end="00:02:18.470" style="s2">Allah and so that is a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.290" end="00:02:20.599" style="s2">self terminating system it makes plenty</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.470" end="00:02:23.209" style="s2">of sense that when there was just so</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.599" end="00:02:25.640" style="s2">much low-hanging fruit in terms of coal</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.209" end="00:02:27.470" style="s2">and oil and fish and trees and etc that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.640" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">we would do this exponential boom kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.470" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">of thing it&#39;s just that&#39;s not viable</p>
