<p begin="00:00:04.960" end="00:00:07.319" style="s2">Ladies and gentlemen, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.920" end="00:00:10.920" style="s2">I wanna welcome you to our</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.990" end="00:00:14.500" style="s2">VIP reception with Dr. Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.620" end="00:00:17.440" style="s2">We&#39;re so glad to have you all with us.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:22.700" style="s2">I&#39;ll just be brief. I do want to especially thank Don Sebastiani</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.320" end="00:00:25.520" style="s2">of Don Sebastiani and Sons for</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.620" end="00:00:32.260" style="s2">very generously donating the wines that we have tonight for the reception, and I hope you&#39;ll enjoy them.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:36.400" style="s2">Dr. Peterson will be here momentarily to take photos</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.000" end="00:00:39.400" style="s2">for all those who are interested.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.700" end="00:00:44.600" style="s2">Right afterward, we&#39;re going to have a Q&amp;A session where you can personally ask</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.920" end="00:00:47.480" style="s2">questions with him and have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">so, please enjoy yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.440" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">Thank you again for joining with us</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.700" end="00:00:55.840" style="s2">Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.060" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">So my question is related to an interview you did with Camille Paglia</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.900" end="00:01:04.480" style="s2">not long ago, and you were referring to Robert Sapolsky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.560" end="00:01:10.160" style="s2">work about the zebras and how if the lions don&#39;t go after the zebras because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.480" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">camouflaged into the herd, not the landscape.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">And Sapolsky would put a red dot on a hunch and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.180" end="00:01:21.800" style="s2">The Lions would then go after that Zebra and I get that I believe that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.420" end="00:01:24.660" style="s2">But my question, how do the lions</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:29.760" style="s2">communicate with each other to go after the one zebra with the red dot?</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.260" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">Well, I think the answer to that is that lions are a lot smarter than we think they are.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.020" end="00:01:38.600" style="s2">you know well, you think about it, you know like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:43.700" style="s2">hunting animals have to be very very intelligent when they hunt in packs</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.800" end="00:01:46.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re obviously communicating with one another constantly and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">they isolate an individual that&#39;s identifiable in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">and they seem to be able to determine</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:56.760" style="s2">perhaps from its behavior, perhaps because of the behavior of the hunters</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.760" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">what that animal is.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.700" style="s2">But I mean, to be a predator means to manifest substantial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.700" end="00:02:05.380" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think we understand it very well at all.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.380" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">(I agree, I think you&#39;re telepathic)</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.000" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">Yeah, well animals are strange, you know? You know how they can pick up your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.220" end="00:02:14.060" style="s2">They&#39;re, they&#39;re very good at decoding nonverbal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.069" end="00:02:18.460" style="s2">And so they&#39;re communicating through their posture and so forth, but I don&#39;t think we understand it very well at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:21.620" style="s2">You bet. Another question?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:26.580" style="s2">Dr. B&#39;s here, a college professor here in California.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.460" end="00:02:31.600" style="s2">You said some things that are a little bit disheartening to me as an educator for our youth</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.600" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">who are bringing them up into this new society and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:40.180" style="s2">educating them to think deeply about what the meaning is for themselves as individuals.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.180" end="00:02:41.900" style="s2">How do you see</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.180" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">academics</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.320" end="00:02:49.220" style="s2">as failing our students now?</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">Well, you know I really think Faculties of Education should probably just be burned to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">you know, I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.020" end="00:03:01.020" style="s2">They&#39;re failing them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.300" end="00:03:02.540" style="s2">They&#39;re, they&#39;re failing.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.540" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">The Faculties of Education in particular are failing them in a variety of ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:13.600" style="s2">The first is that I&#39;ve seen no evidence coming from the Faculties of Education that our understanding of how to educate children</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.600" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">more efficiently has progressed at all in the last 40 years.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:19.580" style="s2">In fact, I think it&#39;s gone backwards.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.580" end="00:03:24.660" style="s2">And a lot of the things the faculties of Education had pushed, like self esteem,</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.660" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">which actually doesn&#39;t exist because it&#39;s measured improperly,</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">like whole word learning for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:31.880" style="s2">like multiple intelligences.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.880" end="00:03:35.600" style="s2">All these things have actually set the cause of Education back substantially</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.640" end="00:03:39.080" style="s2">because they&#39;re not based on anything that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.080" end="00:03:41.400" style="s2">and then the introduction of... of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.460" end="00:03:49.300" style="s2">well, this... this very complex gender education to me is nothing but ideology it&#39;s being introduced</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.320" end="00:03:53.300" style="s2">To children who are far too young and who have enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.300" end="00:03:56.620" style="s2">confusion in their life without adding that additional dimension.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.620" end="00:03:58.920" style="s2">But most importantly I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.420" end="00:04:01.100" style="s2">The education system.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.100" end="00:04:04.780" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t teach kids to read well, it doesn&#39;t teach them to write well,</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.780" end="00:04:08.660" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t teach them to think about thinking, so they can&#39;t think critically.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.660" end="00:04:14.880" style="s2">And it does almost nothing to help them understand that they have a character that they could develop.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.880" end="00:04:18.240" style="s2">You know, I mean this has been true for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.340" end="00:04:22.040" style="s2">and there&#39;s historical reasons for it. But, be very good, you know to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">to have it. What what grade do you teach?</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:26.480" style="s2">(Um, college)</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.480" end="00:04:27.660" style="s2">College? Oh college.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.720" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">Well even with the college kids</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:32.580" style="s2">like no one&#39;s ever sat down with most of those kids</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.600" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">and asked them for example to write an essay of any length</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:38.420" style="s2">and with any degree of seriousness on</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.280" style="s2">who they would like to be and I don&#39;t mean career wise,</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.280" end="00:04:43.400" style="s2">although that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:45.780" style="s2">and why to justify that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:47.920" style="s2">It&#39;s an unbelievably useful exercise.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.180" end="00:04:49.620" style="s2">And so,</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.040" end="00:04:55.460" style="s2">Especially if you&#39;re in the humanities, your job is to teach character development and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.460" end="00:04:57.320" style="s2">we just don&#39;t do that well.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.320" end="00:05:02.820" style="s2">We tend we tear everything apart and put nothing back together and it&#39;s a terrible thing for young people</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:05.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:07.260" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.180" end="00:05:14.180" style="s2">Hi, Dr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.980" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">Another education question, we have a daughter who&#39;s in fifth grade in San Francisco.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.710" end="00:05:24.660" style="s2">She&#39;s in a private school because the public schools here are by and large abysmal</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:26.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.440" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">they are I recall</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:35.720" style="s2">Hearing a lecture of yours where you said as soon as the school starts teaching your kids things like equity, diversity, and inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.760" end="00:05:39.540" style="s2">pull them out. And our daughter&#39;s school is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">deep and wide into that and there seems to be no escape.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">So, my husband I agreed that we would do whatever you say tonight</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:48.640" style="s2">So he said...</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.700" end="00:05:55.200" style="s2">So his solution is that we just need to teach her</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:58.440" style="s2">our values, our individual value system at home.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.620" end="00:06:02.320" style="s2">Well, I say let&#39;s think about pulling her out. So what do you say?</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.200" end="00:06:03.800" style="s2">Um</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.800" end="00:06:08.580" style="s2">How good are you at teaching her your individual values at home?</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.580" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">Like can you can you help her think it through? Is she confused by it?</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:18.040" style="s2">Um, she is confused by it, but she&#39;s mostly rebelling and whenever I try to bring it up, she gets very angry.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">And is she rebelling against your attempts to counter it, or is she? What&#39;s she angry about?</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:32.340" style="s2">She&#39;s angry because she loves her friends at her school. She&#39;s afraid of us pulling her out and she&#39;s pretty defensive of her school.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.260" end="00:06:35.160" style="s2">Well, okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.160" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">So the first thing I would say is that I wouldn&#39;t give you advice because I don&#39;t know the particularities of your situation well enough.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">I think that your...</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">Given what you just told me, your attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.660" end="00:06:56.200" style="s2">provide her with the values that you can provide her with at home are probably her best long-term defense in any case.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.200" end="00:07:00.320" style="s2">It isn&#39;t obvious to me that you&#39;re going to find a place where this isn&#39;t a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.320" end="00:07:02.580" style="s2">So, and she&#39;s in grade five?</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.100" end="00:07:06.660" style="s2">She is, and by the way, my husband keeps whispering &quot;I told you so&quot; in my...</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.580" end="00:07:12.320" style="s2">Well one of the prerogatives of being married at least from time to time.</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.320" end="00:07:14.600" style="s2">So I would, I think...</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">It&#39;s pretty...</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.920" end="00:07:21.820" style="s2">You could try the values move for a good while before you do anything more radical, you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.820" end="00:07:25.140" style="s2">There&#39;s something to be said for minimal necessary force</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.140" end="00:07:29.800" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want to set up any more rebellion on her part than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.800" end="00:07:32.260" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if that&#39;ll be sufficient, but hopefully it will.</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.260" end="00:07:33.240" style="s2">It&#39;s helpful. Thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.240" end="00:07:34.660" style="s2">Yep, you bet. You bet.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.480" end="00:07:36.660" style="s2">Hi</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">Um, how do...</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.040" style="s2">As a student at this university, how do I...?</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.040" end="00:07:44.580" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s hard to me to sometimes...</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.580" end="00:07:47.900" style="s2">I mean, I see the university like crumble like everyday</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.900" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">Like in all this ideology like had and I just find it hard to like</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:55.180" style="s2">How do I keep myself like motivated or like... like... like...?</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.620" end="00:07:57.900" style="s2">Finding it meaningful to continue and like...</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.900" end="00:08:02.780" style="s2">Well your best bet in university is you at least have the chance to read.</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.780" end="00:08:06.830" style="s2">You know, and what you need to do is to I have a list of books on my website</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.830" end="00:08:09.920" style="s2">which you may know about or may not you could go read all those books.</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.920" end="00:08:10.900" style="s2">(I&#39;ve been reading all of them)</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.900" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">Good good. Well, the thing is that the best thing you can do if you&#39;re inundated by foolish</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.840" end="00:08:23.760" style="s2">teaching is to go read all the books that people have thought have, are great</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:30.460" style="s2">because lots of them are great and then you can make your peer group the people who wrote those books and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:36.460" style="s2">hopefully that&#39;ll be enough so that you&#39;ll be a lot more than you were and that would be something but</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.740" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">You have the opportunity to do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.160" style="s2">even if you&#39;re not encouraged to do it, you can do the reading</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.160" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know of any better...</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:49.820" style="s2">That, and I would also say to write, you know, write. Read something great, write about it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">Get your thoughts in order.</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:08:57.700" style="s2">That will help straighten you and you might as well read the best since it&#39;s there and it&#39;s free.</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:03.180" style="s2">Which is also something quite remarkable. I don&#39;t know anything better than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:10.840" style="s2">Dr. Peterson a lot of what you say really resonates with me</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.840" end="00:09:13.860" style="s2">and so I listen to it quite a bit, but sometimes I feel as though</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:17.800" style="s2">You take the position that these people who are concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.800" end="00:09:22.360" style="s2">sexism, racism, and other kinds of discrimination are a bunch of whiners</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.380" end="00:09:26.760" style="s2">and I wonder what you really feel about that and how you would address that issue.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.660" end="00:09:29.660" style="s2">Oh, I think it&#39;s true.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:36.960" style="s2">A lot. And I mean it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think that there are forms of arbitrary prejudice that are counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.080" end="00:09:39.620" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s the case and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.260" end="00:09:41.640" style="s2">detrimental to everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.640" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">I mean, we, it would be wonderful to build a society where people were invited and encouraged to participate</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:54.380" style="s2">based on their level of skill in relationship to the required tasks, right?</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:09:59.580" style="s2">That&#39;s what we&#39;d want. And there are arbitrary barriers. But to... but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.100" end="00:10:05.980" style="s2">the victim culture that&#39;s been generated on the university campuses is not only</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.060" end="00:10:11.960" style="s2">unwarranted in my estimation given how much better things are, say in the United States,</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.960" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">on the sexism and racism front than say 50 years ago, or 40 years ago, or 30 years ago, or 20 years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:24.280" style="s2">There&#39;s been unbelievable improvement and not only that, the emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.300" end="00:10:26.340" style="s2">microaggressions and safe spaces and...</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.600" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">and an interference with freedom of speech are</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.500" end="00:10:35.400" style="s2">definitely making students less resilient rather than more resilient.</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.400" end="00:10:39.520" style="s2">And every psychotherapist worth his salt knows that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">because the way that you help people overcome their anxieties is by exposing them</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.700" end="00:10:51.500" style="s2">voluntarily to things that they neither, things that they&#39;re afraid of and are disgusted by.</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.500" end="00:10:54.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s the core... it&#39;s the core...</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.520" end="00:10:58.980" style="s2">apart from getting your story straight, it&#39;s actually the core of all successful psychotherapies</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.980" end="00:11:01.050" style="s2">and so by protecting students,</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.050" end="00:11:07.620" style="s2">there&#39;s just, there&#39;s there isn&#39;t anything you can do that would make them less resilient than what&#39;s being done in the universities.</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:13.820" style="s2">And Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff in their book &quot;Coddling of the American Mind&quot; laid that out pretty nicely.</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:20.280" style="s2">The American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association should have put out statements in this regard years ago</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.680" end="00:11:25.469" style="s2">Because everyone knows if they&#39;re trained properly that this is just not how you go about doing it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.540" end="00:11:27.140" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t mean...</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.140" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">That doesn&#39;t mean that if you&#39;re concerned with arbitrary discrimination, that that somehow makes you whiny.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">Like I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t believe that because discrimination is real and it&#39;s... it&#39;s... it&#39;s pointless. It&#39;s harmful</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">(How do we address it?)</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:44.060" style="s2">How do we address it? I think...</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.060" end="00:11:44.560" style="s2">(As a society)</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:48.820" style="s2">Well, I think, I think we are addressing it first of all because we&#39;re much less</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.020" end="00:11:53.080" style="s2">prejudiced than we were like at any other point in known history.</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.080" end="00:11:56.700" style="s2">So that&#39;s the first thing is that things have improved at a rate</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.700" end="00:11:58.630" style="s2">That&#39;s so dramatic that it&#39;s almost unbelievable.</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.630" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">But, the way I think that we improve it is that we crush it out inside our individual souls.</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.540" end="00:12:08.340" style="s2">You know for me, this is, that&#39;s why I concentrate on the individual.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.980" end="00:12:13.800" style="s2">Organizing ourselves into tribes and, and, and making that our paramount identity and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.800" end="00:12:21.020" style="s2">teaching students that the appropriate way to view history is as the battleground between identity groups is just a reversion to tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.340" end="00:12:28.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s like whenever a society reverts to tribalism, all that happens is that violence breaks out there&#39;s because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.960" end="00:12:30.070" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.070" end="00:12:36.620" style="s2">Tribal groups are violent and if you can&#39;t speak between your tribes because they&#39;re so clearly different</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.660" end="00:12:40.760" style="s2">Demarcated and there&#39;s no communication, all there is left is violence.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.760" end="00:12:43.060" style="s2">And so I just don&#39;t see that as...</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.060" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">I mean even if the people... let&#39;s let&#39;s give</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:49.400" style="s2">50% of the people who are complaining about discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.620" end="00:12:53.340" style="s2">They&#39;re do as people who are genuinely concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.340" end="00:12:54.980" style="s2">Their solution is inappropriate.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.980" end="00:12:57.500" style="s2">All it&#39;s going to do is cause more trouble</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.500" end="00:13:01.460" style="s2">and the idea that you know, there shouldn&#39;t be a uniting narrative</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.460" end="00:13:04.980" style="s2">I think that&#39;s completely absurd because it&#39;s a uniting...</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.980" end="00:13:08.340" style="s2">we&#39;re all here. We&#39;re all peaceful at the moment.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.340" end="00:13:14.660" style="s2">Despite our pathologies because there&#39;s a uniting narrative, everyone knows what they&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.660" end="00:13:22.360" style="s2">And so everyone acts in a manner that allows everyone to predict each other. And that&#39;s why we&#39;re peaceful, because we&#39;re all half crazy.</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.360" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">You know, and there&#39;s lots of times we&#39;re not peaceful.</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:29.000" style="s2">You need those uniting narratives and they have to be super-ordinate to the group identity.</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.000" end="00:13:29.500" style="s2">And...</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.500" end="00:13:32.020" style="s2">(We all look inside ourselves, every single one.)</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.020" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">(society seems to say &quot;everybody look at yourself carefully and see if you&#39;re doing discrimination&quot;)</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.580" end="00:13:39.400" style="s2">(&quot;and if you are being discriminatory, stop it&quot;.)</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.400" end="00:13:44.400" style="s2">Yeah, well, that&#39;s it and it&#39;s not just discriminatory, I&#39;m sure that, you know the...</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.400" end="00:13:48.180" style="s2">my sense is that the average person, myself included,</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.180" end="00:13:53.900" style="s2">has more than enough sins on their conscience to keep themselves busy polishing themselves up for the rest their life.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.900" end="00:13:57.380" style="s2">and so I think that&#39;s a really good place to start, because you know,</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.380" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">you take the damn responsibility on yourself and if you&#39;re looking outside for someone to blame, then, then,</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.840" end="00:14:09.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the first sign that there&#39;s probably something wrong and it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know that some people have it rough.</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.480" end="00:14:14.520" style="s2">Some people have it rough and, and, and it&#39;s because of external things that have happened to them,</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.520" end="00:14:20.660" style="s2">but their best bet still is to take the responsibility for fixing that onto themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.320" end="00:14:26.540" style="s2">And you weaken people if you say that they&#39;re the passive victim of external forces and...</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.820" end="00:14:32.780" style="s2">Then they become the passive victims of external forces. It&#39;s not good. So, yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:39.220" style="s2">Um, is there a generational divide in the themes of the questions that you get and which ones do you find the most entertaining?</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.740" end="00:14:45.500" style="s2">Don&#39;t really think there is a generational divide particularly. I haven&#39;t noticed it</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:46.340" style="s2">Um...</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.920" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">Most entertaining...</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:52.500" style="s2">God, that&#39;s a tough one. I mean...</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:53.620" style="s2">(Did you have fun?)</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.740" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">Haha, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.740" end="00:15:01.100" style="s2">Look, I mean...</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.100" end="00:15:05.260" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say that what I&#39;ve been doing for the last three years has been fun...</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.340" end="00:15:07.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s been unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.800" end="00:15:11.720" style="s2">worthwhile and meaningful, you know, like it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.740" end="00:15:13.220" style="s2">been...</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.220" end="00:15:19.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve continued to do it because I can&#39;t think of anything better to do than to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.780" end="00:15:25.620" style="s2">event like this and to talk seriously to people about issues that I hope are fundamental.</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.820" end="00:15:30.400" style="s2">And the evidence seems to be that it, as far as I can tell, that it&#39;s doing a</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">substantial number of people a substantial amount of good</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:37.840" style="s2">and so that&#39;s not fun precisely, but it&#39;s better than fun.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.840" end="00:15:42.920" style="s2">But I can tell you one thing that well, this is how it&#39;s better than fun in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:45.860" style="s2">You know I mentioned this in my talk tonight.</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.100" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">It&#39;s very...</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.500" end="00:15:48.920" style="s2">affecting...</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.560" end="00:15:56.220" style="s2">To travel all over the world and to have people that I don&#39;t know come up to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.300" end="00:15:57.340" style="s2">Constantly...</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.840" end="00:16:04.760" style="s2">Like if I was outside during a day, it would happen 50 times and say &quot;look I was having a hell of a time&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.280" end="00:16:11.500" style="s2">&quot;and here&#39;s why and here&#39;s the things I&#39;ve done to change and it&#39;s way better&quot;. And you know,</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.140" end="00:16:17.880" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anything you could hope for that would be better in your life than to be able to travel to places you&#39;ve never been,</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:22.280" style="s2">everywhere and for perfect strangers to come up to you on the street,</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.420" end="00:16:29.560" style="s2">politely and tell you that their lives are much better than they were and and that it was because of...</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:37.800" style="s2">paying some attention to what, to what I&#39;ve been communicating, not originating but communicating.</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.020" end="00:16:40.460" style="s2">So, that&#39;s, that&#39;s a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.460" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">and as long as that continues, then I&#39;ll continue doing this and I&#39;ll be content with whatever fun I manage to extract from the process.</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.940" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">So we will just do one more because I&#39;m starting to to not be very</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:17:00.380" style="s2">coherent and that&#39;s always a good place to stop. So who&#39;s got the mic?</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.380" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">(I got the mic. If logos speaks habitable order into chaos, and we reflect that by speaking truth)</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:07.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s good,</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.310" end="00:17:13.749" style="s2">then when we fail to speak truth, is that evil and how has it differentiated from the original chaos that was being spoken to?</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:23.080" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s definit... I would say that it&#39;s, I would say yes that it&#39;s evil that that&#39;s the right way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.880" end="00:17:29.080" style="s2">The initial chaos is more...</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.140" end="00:17:31.400" style="s2">it&#39;s more blurry potential.</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.400" end="00:17:35.680" style="s2">Like it has the alternatives of going many ways if you...</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.900" end="00:17:42.129" style="s2">like I&#39;ve dealt with families, say in my clinical practice who have practiced many generations of deep lies.</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.770" end="00:17:50.499" style="s2">And so there&#39;s a potential there, right, that the lies generated but it&#39;s almost impossible to set it straight.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.650" end="00:17:56.769" style="s2">Like once you cast something like that into being, it&#39;s much more difficult to...</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.560" end="00:17:59.270" style="s2">turn to the good</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.270" end="00:18:01.509" style="s2">You know, you know it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.510" end="00:18:08.920" style="s2">you know you, you think oh, &quot;this is the day I&#39;m finally gonna tell off my boss&quot; and it&#39;s like maybe you should have had</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.530" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">an intelligent conversation with him at a slightly lower voice tone three years ago, you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.940" end="00:18:18.820" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a little late and you go there and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.100" end="00:18:24.289" style="s2">you, you sacrifice your job because you can no longer control your anger and now you&#39;re unemployed</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.450" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have a record, a good employment record for your next job. And now your family doesn&#39;t have anything to rely on.</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.780" end="00:18:35.500" style="s2">It&#39;s like that&#39;s chaos man, but it&#39;s not easy to set straight</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.020" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">whereas normally, as long as you haven&#39;t done anything too</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.860" end="00:18:45.320" style="s2">pathological, what opens up in front of you is paths that could go in either direction</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.500" end="00:18:49.180" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s, it&#39;s not that hard to set it straight</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:50.460" style="s2">it&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.460" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">But once you&#39;ve made the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.180" end="00:18:58.840" style="s2">Well, you have to fix the mistake and then you have to recast the potential and that&#39;s that&#39;s hard, it requires</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">You have to admit that you did something wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:06.540" style="s2">You have to have the humility to note that you, that you&#39;re the one in error. You have to calculate</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.740" end="00:19:12.460" style="s2">the strategy for setting it right. You have to implement it and then you have to decide you&#39;re not going to do it again</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">Right, that&#39;s the full...</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.820" end="00:19:16.529" style="s2">What do you call that?</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.529" end="00:19:18.880" style="s2">When you go to Catholic Church, and you...</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.340" end="00:19:25.660" style="s2">Confess! You have to confess and you have to repent and you know, and you have to atone.</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:31.340" style="s2">And that&#39;s what you do to eradicate evil, is you confess and you repent and you atone and...</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.769" end="00:19:38.329" style="s2">Those out to atone is to... that&#39;s at one right, to restore that initial unity</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:40.020" style="s2">It&#39;s very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.020" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">And the more are things like that you pile up around yourself that lower the probability that you&#39;ll straighten it out.</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.300" end="00:19:49.320" style="s2">So, that&#39;s how it&#39;s different. Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.680" end="00:19:52.280" style="s2">All right. Ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.520" end="00:19:55.060" style="s2">Very nice to be here tonight.</p>
