<p begin="00:00:05.380" end="00:00:06.380" style="s2">All right.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.380" end="00:00:07.460" style="s2">So let&#39;s do Russian hacking.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.460" end="00:00:11.270" style="s2">And what I want to do is I want to put quotes<br />around &quot;Russian hacking&quot; because we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.270" end="00:00:16.640" style="s2">talking about a question of how we go about<br />making sense of everything all together.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.640" end="00:00:21.970" style="s2">So &quot;Russian hacking&quot; is not an event as much<br />as it is a phenomenon that describes a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.970" end="00:00:27.270" style="s2">large number of things that different individuals,<br />depending on the particular location in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.270" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">social field, interpret differently.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:37.040" style="s2">So yes I think this is an excellent example<br />of this new emergent mechanism of how we go</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.040" end="00:00:39.160" style="s2">about doing social control.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.160" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">And it&#39;s interesting because if you&#39;re looking<br />at &quot;Russian hacking&quot; from the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">perspective you&#39;re actually thinking about<br />something that isn&#39;t actually how it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:51.590" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to be making particular mistakes.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.590" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">So you will think I think, I mean certainly<br />I&#39;m defining the blue church so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:01:01.870" style="s2">if you are in the blue church modality you<br />will think that there is some kind of hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.870" end="00:01:08.470" style="s2">control structure with a small number of decision-makers,<br />we will call them the Russians, who are principally</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.470" end="00:01:13.630" style="s2">responsible for the behavior of the system<br />under investigation.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.630" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">So you are looking for an expertise hierarchy,<br />somebody who is in charge and how their expertise</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:25.080" style="s2">hierarchy is percolating downward in its downward<br />causation fashion to generate the results</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.080" end="00:01:27.229" style="s2">of what you&#39;re seeing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.229" end="00:01:31.850" style="s2">And that&#39;s actually not an appropriate evaluation<br />of what&#39;s actually going on.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.850" end="00:01:37.700" style="s2">Instead &quot;Russian hacking&quot; and the degree to<br />which there is a specific understanding on</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.700" end="00:01:43.109" style="s2">the part of the Russians, which there certainly<br />is they&#39;re clearly, what is the phrase somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.109" end="00:01:46.999" style="s2">used—“punching up”?—They&#39;re clearly<br />dramatically more effective right now than</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.999" end="00:01:52.010" style="s2">one should expect them to be given their actual<br />capacity and power in the world because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.010" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">the higher quality strategy in this new decentralized<br />environment is I think actually recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:03.429" style="s2">the obsolescence of that notion of a top down<br />decision-making framework where one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.429" end="00:02:10.149" style="s2">primary strategies is to find people who are<br />operating in that fashion and throw effectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.149" end="00:02:16.250" style="s2">sand in their eyes, create obfuscation mechanisms<br />that cause top down decision making trees</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.250" end="00:02:20.460" style="s2">to have a hard time either understanding what&#39;s<br />coming up to them or having their actuation</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.460" end="00:02:28.650" style="s2">potentials move down while simultaneously<br />being part of a very large decentralized,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.650" end="00:02:34.690" style="s2">not centralized but a decentralized collective<br />that is fluid and has an up-regulation behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.690" end="00:02:41.660" style="s2">So modulating things like okay there seems<br />to be an energy and a focus and an ambient</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.660" end="00:02:48.740" style="s2">interest among some group of decentralized<br />individuals around certain ideas, how do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.740" end="00:02:53.730" style="s2">provide them with an increase in localized<br />energy or capacity to enable them to focus</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.730" end="00:02:56.030" style="s2">in a certain area and engage in activation.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.030" end="00:03:03.260" style="s2">So it&#39;s more of a potentiation strategy and<br />much less of a control strategy.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.260" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">And then the other side of it, and this is<br />a deep insight that I don&#39;t think anybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">is really grasping, including myself, is the<br />distinction between, for example, mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">warfare and information warfare.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.630" end="00:03:21.150" style="s2">And I think many of the blue church folks<br />are particularly missing in on this.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.150" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">Mimetic warfare is in many ways a legacy of<br />the kinds of stuff that television does very</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:30.390" style="s2">well: “Let me tell you a story which is<br />designed to create an effect in you that will</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.390" end="00:03:31.730" style="s2">move you emotionally and cognitively.”</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.730" end="00:03:37.300" style="s2">And that, of course, changes and the nature<br />of mimetic warfare changes in the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.300" end="00:03:42.710" style="s2">domain and we&#39;ve seen that broadly: Kids on<br />4chan generating images that flow out very</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.710" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">rapidly and are selected for almost ecologically.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">But there&#39;s also information warfare, which<br />is the recognition that you can actually use</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.840" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">very high-quality statistics and very high-quality<br />precision to modulate subtle causation in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:03:59.590" style="s2">the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.590" end="00:04:02.370" style="s2">So for example, I&#39;ll give you sort of a hypothetical.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.370" end="00:04:09.570" style="s2">Let&#39;s say, for example, my statistics told<br />me that there was a sensitive point in one</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.570" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">of the Florida districts where the likelihood<br />of decision making that say there was a 51/49,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">we don&#39;t know exactly, is open, the possibility<br />space was open on how that would play out.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">And I could generate some kind of very lightweight<br />intervention that would increase the rate</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">of traffic jams in that environment by say<br />hacking the stop lights so the stop lights</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:34.210" style="s2">are on a different frequency.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.210" end="00:04:40.190" style="s2">And thereby decreasing the turnout and by<br />decreasing the turnout could probabilistically</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.190" end="00:04:43.940" style="s2">affect that particular sensitive decision<br />point.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.940" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">That&#39;s information warfare at a very, very<br />high level and the whole point is subtle,</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">very distributed, highly probabilistic.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:59.030" style="s2">It&#39;s much more like the way that one might<br />do a distributed portfolio in finance as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.030" end="00:05:00.480" style="s2">to a concentrated bet.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.480" end="00:05:03.760" style="s2">And that&#39;s another piece of this whole story<br />the kind of thing that the blue church is</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.760" end="00:05:09.040" style="s2">very challenged to do because it&#39;s decision<br />making structure requires that it make a small</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.040" end="00:05:14.070" style="s2">number of big bets, but that this new decentralized<br />mechanism can in fact make a very large number</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.070" end="00:05:16.690" style="s2">of very small bets and they can be extremely<br />fine-tuned.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.690" end="00:05:22.540" style="s2">I mean the point is that you don&#39;t actually<br />have to take this “I’m super good at understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.540" end="00:05:27.880" style="s2">how to make complicated things,” which is<br />the older model, and just throw shit out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.880" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">just see what happens.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:32.350" style="s2">I&#39;ll throw something out, which kind of works<br />and somebody else will grab it and modify</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.350" end="00:05:35.720" style="s2">it and it kind of works better, and somebody<br />else will grab it and modify it and it pops,</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.720" end="00:05:37.980" style="s2">and then a whole bunch of people up-regulate<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.980" end="00:05:42.490" style="s2">So it&#39;s a collective search algorithm with<br />the ability to modify because remember we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.490" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">dealing about symmetry and communication.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:48.930" style="s2">So I can grab what you did, I can modify it<br />and push it back out, and this enables a completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.930" end="00:05:54.250" style="s2">different invention, construction and dissemination<br />function.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.250" end="00:05:55.870" style="s2">I think that&#39;s fundamental.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.870" end="00:06:01.160" style="s2">Like if you&#39;re not understanding how to engage<br />in that strategy you&#39;re going to be selected</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.160" end="00:06:06.199" style="s2">against increasingly over the next even short<br />period of time like three or four years.</p>
