<p begin="00:00:10.530" end="00:00:15.059" style="s2">goal interpreted them personally</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.780" end="00:00:17.850" style="s2">it was easier to take the music apart</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.059" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">and understand in an auditory way what</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.850" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">Bach was trying to do music helps</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.070" end="00:00:30.980" style="s2">even nihilistic and that&#39;s interesting</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:36.990" style="s2">overwhelmed by a sense of it&#39;s really a</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.829" end="00:00:48.720" style="s2">and they&#39;re pretty opaque to what art</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:51.720" style="s2">represents and so they have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.720" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">with it or maybe they need more less</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.720" end="00:00:56.690" style="s2">sophisticated art it&#39;s too shocking to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">them if it&#39;s sophisticated and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.690" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">profound they can&#39;t handle it lots of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:05.510" style="s2">people are terrified by art if they like</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">things they like music they like kitsch</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.510" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">because if it&#39;s real it&#39;s too much for</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">that they don&#39;t like it it&#39;s that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.340" end="00:01:18.630" style="s2">can&#39;t handle it they&#39;re afraid of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">people are even afraid of color you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.630" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">that&#39;s why everybody uses beige in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:25.650" style="s2">decorating and creams you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:28.369" style="s2">terrified of color so people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.650" end="00:01:31.140" style="s2">terrified of deep truths and no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.369" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">so they they wouldn&#39;t be deep if they</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">weren&#39;t terrifying when we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">world we see objects handleable and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:42.150" style="s2">usable objects in motion but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">really what the world is like what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.150" end="00:01:48.900" style="s2">world is like is a set of interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.970" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">and interconnected patterns at multiple</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.900" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">levels of resolution from the tiniest to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">the largest all playing together in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">patterned and somewhat predictable</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">manner not completely predictable like</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">music isn&#39;t completely predictable and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.500" style="s2">so the reason that music is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">when you listen to it is because music</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.500" end="00:02:07.740" style="s2">demonstrates to you what the structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">of the universe is actually like and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.740" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">your senses your visual sense blinds you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:14.460" style="s2">to that because it&#39;s more practical in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">way it shows you what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.460" end="00:02:22.460" style="s2">right now whereas music gives you this</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">sculptural picture of quantized patterns</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.460" end="00:02:26.310" style="s2">interacting at multiple levels of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:28.200" style="s2">analysis simultaneously and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.310" end="00:02:31.340" style="s2">enthuses people with a sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.200" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">our truly artistic production is full of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.340" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">inarticulate meaning it&#39;s inarticulate</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:41.700" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s still in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.510" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">developmental stage before articulate</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.700" end="00:02:46.500" style="s2">knowledge and so it grips people with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">sense of significance but they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.500" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">necessarily say why and the reason they</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:52.380" style="s2">can&#39;t say why is because the why for</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">that kind of meaning hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.380" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">explicate the reason that art is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:02:59.640" style="s2">meaningful to people is because art is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.640" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">it&#39;s full of the next set of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:07.740" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of looking about it or</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">it&#39;s or it&#39;s full of eternal ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.740" end="00:03:12.180" style="s2">people still haven&#39;t fully comprehended</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:14.450" style="s2">and so you can&#39;t help but by be gripped</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.180" end="00:03:14.450" style="s2">by it</p>
