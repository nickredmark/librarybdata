<p begin="00:00:01.280" end="00:00:06.960" style="s2">so the notorious</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.040" end="00:00:09.920" style="s2">rbg died yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.960" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">ruth bader ginsburg at the age of 87</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:13.280" style="s2">died from complications with pancreatic</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">cancer</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:17.600" style="s2">and the fact that she was basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">required to work through</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.600" end="00:00:23.119" style="s2">cancer into her late 80s</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:25.279" style="s2">she could have retired at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.119" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">obama&#39;s presidency and she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.279" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">probably because like the rest of us she</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">thought that hillary clinton was going</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:31.279" style="s2">to get in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:33.440" style="s2">and that would have been really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.279" end="00:00:36.719" style="s2">to be one of the supreme court justices</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.440" end="00:00:38.239" style="s2">on the supreme court when the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.719" end="00:00:39.440" style="s2">woman was a president right that would</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.239" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">as one of the very</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.440" end="00:00:43.520" style="s2">this only the second female on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">supreme court having hillary be your</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.520" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">president would be pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:49.360" style="s2">and also if you&#39;re not ready to retire</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">you&#39;re not ready to retire</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.360" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">i think if she would have known that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">trump was getting in she maybe would</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">have would have retired</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">but then she would have retired very</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">early in obama&#39;s presidency so he could</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">have appointed a a new supreme court</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">justice without what happened at the end</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">of his presidency when i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.199" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">why there was a spot that was open</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">whether someone died or retired</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">but when there was that spot that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">open and there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">controversy whether he should appoint or</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">wait till the to the next president to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">point and i know they waited until the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">next president</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">and then we got kavanagh when you look</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">at the difference between kavanaugh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:23.600" style="s2">backstory and he was able to get on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">supreme court</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.600" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">versus her backstory her backstory i</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:31.360" style="s2">it she&#39;s she&#39;s died and so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">going to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.360" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">dig up horrible things about her but i</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">guarantee you she wouldn&#39;t be on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">supreme court if she had horrible things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">in her history</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">even like a rumor of it let alone</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">multiple women coming forward she went</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">to law school when there was very few</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">women who went out of a class of 500 she</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">one of nine women she went to school</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">with her husband her husband</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:57.680" style="s2">went through cancer while they were in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.840" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">law school they had a daughter so she</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.680" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">attended both of their classes looked</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">after her husband and their young</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">daughter</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">well to like being a lawyer and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">graduate at the top of her class</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">she couldn&#39;t find a job she ended up</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">becoming a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">that is like a superhero backstory</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">like to be able to do all of that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">have to have some superhuman vitality</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">some superhuman intelligence and she</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">clearly had her</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">her cognitive capabilities up until the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">end my grandmother had her cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">capabilities up until 98. i remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">sitting in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">room table being like your brain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">better than my brain my brain&#39;s in its</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">30s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">your brains in its 90s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">but there&#39;s something so broken about</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">our current system that she was forced</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.239" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">to to be there up until when she she</p>
