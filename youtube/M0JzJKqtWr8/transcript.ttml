<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the third anniversary of the day</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">that 50 students I had never met showed</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">up at my classroom accusing me of racism</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">and demanding that I either resign or be</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.260" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">fired I refused and things descended</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">from there into certainly chaos and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">would argue an argument which was in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2">fact the the plan of many of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">protesters all right where shall we</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:08.420" style="s2">begin I think you wanted to start before</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">we talk a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.420" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">evergreen had been in its past and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">it was founded about the spectacular and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">public nature of the collapse just start</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">there that&#39;s what you had said to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">yeah the problem for us is that we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">for reasons that will surely come up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">our discussion here we were fully</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">ensconced in a life in Olympia</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">Washington and our our teaching lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">were the core of it so we spent 14 years</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">in my case 15 years in yours</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">teaching in an environment that freed us</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">to do remarkable things when the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">collapse happened and suddenly the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">existence of evergreen was on many</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">people&#39;s minds who didn&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">about it beforehand and our roles there</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">was suddenly front and center it gave</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:05.719" style="s2">people an impression of the place and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">inevitably that impression would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.719" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">misleading it couldn&#39;t help it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">you know at best it was a vignette and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:12.490" style="s2">it was a vignette at a moment that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.700" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.490" end="00:02:19.690" style="s2">very abnormal but it has been kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.700" end="00:02:22.630" style="s2">struggle since the thing occurred to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.690" end="00:02:27.730" style="s2">to correct the record so that people you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.630" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">know we don&#39;t want it to be recorded in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.730" end="00:02:31.060" style="s2">people&#39;s minds as a cartoon and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2">wanted to be recorded as the actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.060" end="00:02:35.140" style="s2">descent into madness that it was but</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:36.790" style="s2">descent from what that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.140" end="00:02:39.220" style="s2">tough part the public nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.790" end="00:02:40.750" style="s2">descent overwrote the true nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.220" end="00:02:43.300" style="s2">what was actually going on there which</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.750" end="00:02:46.540" style="s2">wasn&#39;t all good but nonetheless there</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.300" end="00:02:48.220" style="s2">was nuance yes um particularly on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.540" end="00:02:51.580" style="s2">political right would argue that this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.220" end="00:02:53.350" style="s2">the inevitable end of any place that had</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.580" end="00:02:55.210" style="s2">broken so many of the rules of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.350" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">status quo model of higher ed as</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.210" end="00:03:00.790" style="s2">evergreen dead and we have and will</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:02.950" style="s2">continue to push back quite firmly on</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.790" end="00:03:04.060" style="s2">that there was this this didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.950" end="00:03:06.340" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.060" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">certainly evergreen ended up being game</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.340" end="00:03:12.880" style="s2">of all and thus as anything that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:15.910" style="s2">gamble will happen it got gamed but</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.880" end="00:03:19.510" style="s2">there was nothing about the original</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.910" end="00:03:22.750" style="s2">nature of the school in its attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.510" end="00:03:26.260" style="s2">get rid of some of the top-down generic</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.750" end="00:03:28.270" style="s2">sit and rose and ask question you speak</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.260" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">only when spoken to Zoar model of higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.270" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">ed that evergreen was resisting and had</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:36.850" style="s2">broken that inherently led to this and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:38.800" style="s2">in fact you know it&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.850" end="00:03:42.010" style="s2">evidence for that is that none of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.800" end="00:03:44.050" style="s2">students and indeed none of the students</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.010" end="00:03:46.510" style="s2">of the handful of other faculty there</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.050" end="00:03:48.280" style="s2">who were doing you know and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.510" end="00:03:51.640" style="s2">there were more than a handful but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.280" end="00:03:53.230" style="s2">wasn&#39;t everyone by any means there were</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.640" end="00:03:54.970" style="s2">a handful of other feather there whom we</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.230" end="00:03:56.380" style="s2">were close with none of our students</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.970" end="00:03:59.650" style="s2">under their students were part of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.380" end="00:04:02.410" style="s2">madness they were there trying to engage</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.650" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">their brains their bodies their minds in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.410" end="00:04:08.860" style="s2">a pursuit of truth beauty compassion any</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:12.459" style="s2">number of things but they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.860" end="00:04:14.709" style="s2">not invested in or participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.459" end="00:04:16.390" style="s2">madness yeah in fact the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.709" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">occurred to me this morning as I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.390" end="00:04:22.570" style="s2">reflecting on the anniversary was that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:24.430" style="s2">at some level evergreen where it worked</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.570" end="00:04:28.780" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.430" end="00:04:31.479" style="s2">it was a attempt to instantiate the sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.780" end="00:04:34.150" style="s2">of Star Trek model of getting along</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.479" end="00:04:36.580" style="s2">we&#39;re basically one puts aside the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.150" end="00:04:40.990" style="s2">superficial stuff and you team up for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.580" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">some sort of a larger goal and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.990" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">so the the aspect of the college that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:51.130" style="s2">worked really did manage to look past</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:54.040" style="s2">people&#39;s superficial characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.130" end="00:04:55.570" style="s2">to very good effect okay so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.040" end="00:04:56.949" style="s2">like we&#39;re kind of we&#39;re kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.570" end="00:04:58.300" style="s2">someplace right I thought you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.949" end="00:04:59.650" style="s2">start with something spectacular talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.300" end="00:05:00.910" style="s2">about what the madness looked like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.650" end="00:05:03.130" style="s2">gonna get there but as long as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.910" end="00:05:05.979" style="s2">doing this let&#39;s say we want this to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.130" end="00:05:08.050" style="s2">amusing and cathartic and something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.979" end="00:05:11.320" style="s2">actually gets us someplace someplace new</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.050" end="00:05:13.180" style="s2">but let&#39;s just can I just go into what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.320" end="00:05:14.860" style="s2">what I had thought about us doing second</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.180" end="00:05:16.630" style="s2">since we&#39;re sort of easing into it</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.860" end="00:05:19.930" style="s2">anyway so I&#39;m just going to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.630" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">little bit to begin about what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.930" end="00:05:24.850" style="s2">mission of the college was and and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:27.669" style="s2">particular a nearly founding faculty who</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.850" end="00:05:29.800" style="s2">died last month who was of particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.669" end="00:05:32.710" style="s2">note and I think he really epitomized</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.800" end="00:05:34.090" style="s2">what evergreen could be okay so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.710" end="00:05:36.099" style="s2">was founded by visionaries and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:39.099" style="s2">innovators by people who in the late</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.099" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">1960s saw the status quo in higher ed as</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.099" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">too nimble I mean as too rigid and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:46.180" style="s2">nimble enough by interactive enough for</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:48.220" style="s2">the times or for the future that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.180" end="00:05:50.710" style="s2">imagined was coming the founding faculty</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.220" end="00:05:53.830" style="s2">were in eclectic bunch and you taught</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.710" end="00:05:56.470" style="s2">with a few of them actually and we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.830" end="00:05:59.169" style="s2">at Evergreen starting in 2002 and 2003</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.470" end="00:06:01.720" style="s2">respectively for the tail end of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.169" end="00:06:02.889" style="s2">tenure of the founding faculty just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.720" end="00:06:05.410" style="s2">few of them remained at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.889" end="00:06:07.419" style="s2">we showed up at that point you taught</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.410" end="00:06:08.919" style="s2">with Tom Rainey and David Milne and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.419" end="00:06:10.120" style="s2">think I think that was it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.919" end="00:06:12.820" style="s2">the founding faculty whom you talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.120" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">with and the the faculty who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.820" end="00:06:18.310" style="s2">quite founding but got there really</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:22.780" style="s2">early included Steve Herman who died</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.310" end="00:06:24.520" style="s2">last month and Steve was a great man he</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.780" end="00:06:26.889" style="s2">was a great educator and naturalist a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.520" end="00:06:29.169" style="s2">great mentor and a friend he was also an</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.889" end="00:06:33.130" style="s2">ornithologist and Cod did he know birds</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.169" end="00:06:34.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t I&#39;ve never met anyone else who</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.130" end="00:06:36.169" style="s2">knew birds as well as he did although</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">his students</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.169" end="00:06:40.610" style="s2">caught up to him pretty you know where</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">it worked to catch up with him his</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.610" end="00:06:45.560" style="s2">students adored him his colleagues did</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:47.509" style="s2">not and I think that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.560" end="00:06:50.120" style="s2">telling if I can if I can interject one</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.509" end="00:06:52.280" style="s2">thing so students very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.120" end="00:06:53.990" style="s2">bounced between your programs and my</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.280" end="00:06:57.740" style="s2">programs and into the programs that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:06:59.719" style="s2">taught together yeah in general the best</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.740" end="00:07:00.949" style="s2">of our students during the summer would</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.719" end="00:07:03.229" style="s2">go off and they would take summer</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.949" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">ornithology with Steve so although I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.229" end="00:07:09.139" style="s2">barely knew him he was like the third</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:12.139" style="s2">member of the team in some ways because</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.139" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">what they learned from us on campus</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.139" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">during the year they then put into</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:18.650" style="s2">practice in the field with birds and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:20.780" style="s2">anyway he was a very important figure in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.650" end="00:07:22.789" style="s2">art in our community that&#39;s right and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.780" end="00:07:24.110" style="s2">parent and apparently I didn&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.789" end="00:07:27.139" style="s2">but in looking back through some old</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.110" end="00:07:29.000" style="s2">emails in the last few days I found that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.139" end="00:07:30.139" style="s2">he actually used to talk about running</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.000" end="00:07:33.259" style="s2">his own separate College within</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.139" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">Evergreen as as we did as well right</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.259" end="00:07:38.750" style="s2">so he also he not only did he know birds</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:40.729" style="s2">he knew it was possible at Evergreen and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.750" end="00:07:42.889" style="s2">in the natural world and in the hearts</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.729" end="00:07:45.139" style="s2">and minds of students and it&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.889" end="00:07:48.139" style="s2">else too so I was told that the position</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.139" end="00:07:50.060" style="s2">that I was hired to in a in a common</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.139" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">tradition in academia was to replace</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.060" end="00:07:55.310" style="s2">someone and that someone in my case was</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:57.409" style="s2">Steve and it was clearly impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.310" end="00:08:00.110" style="s2">actually replace him but I was I was his</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.409" end="00:08:01.699" style="s2">academic so you replaced him in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.110" end="00:08:03.020" style="s2">daytime curriculum he continued to teach</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.699" end="00:08:04.490" style="s2">summer ornithology</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.020" end="00:08:07.099" style="s2">that&#39;s right throughout the period that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.490" end="00:08:09.770" style="s2">we were there that&#39;s right so I was told</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.099" end="00:08:11.289" style="s2">by many faculty at Evergreen during my</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.770" end="00:08:14.419" style="s2">tenure there that Steve was quarrelsome</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.289" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">and a curmudgeon and cantankerous and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.419" end="00:08:19.819" style="s2">not worth engaging with and I was then</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:23.300" style="s2">very grateful to become friends with him</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.819" end="00:08:26.210" style="s2">quickly once I was even told by faculty</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.300" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">colleague when I was being a thorn in</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.210" end="00:08:31.879" style="s2">this person&#39;s side that I was just like</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">Steve Herman and I smiled and gave</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.879" end="00:08:35.779" style="s2">thanks for the unintended compliment</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:36.860" style="s2">which further worked this guy as you I</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.779" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">think you were in the room when this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.860" end="00:08:44.510" style="s2">happened Steve Herman appreciated honest</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:46.490" style="s2">and honorable feedback he craved it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.510" end="00:08:47.970" style="s2">not many people gave it to him because</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.490" end="00:08:49.500" style="s2">they found him scary</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.970" end="00:08:50.819" style="s2">I thought that it had to be his way or</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.500" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">the highway but in fact it was quite the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.819" end="00:08:59.430" style="s2">opposite he he had no patience though</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:09:01.649" style="s2">for complacency for sick of fancy for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.430" end="00:09:03.089" style="s2">cowardice or for laziness he had no</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.649" end="00:09:04.500" style="s2">patience for these things and he gave</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.089" end="00:09:06.329" style="s2">people the truth whether they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.500" end="00:09:08.040" style="s2">hear it or not and this is of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.329" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">part of a big part of why he had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.040" end="00:09:12.149" style="s2">reputation for being cantankerous</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.930" end="00:09:14.699" style="s2">because people didn&#39;t always like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.149" end="00:09:19.199" style="s2">he had to say to them he was kind and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.699" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">wonderful and honorable but he he did</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.199" end="00:09:22.230" style="s2">not suffer fools lightly I was just</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:24.439" style="s2">going to say he did not suffer</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.230" end="00:09:28.740" style="s2">administrators lightly well and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.439" end="00:09:30.180" style="s2">though I did have a line here he was not</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.740" end="00:09:31.649" style="s2">cantankerous despite what some of his</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.180" end="00:09:33.329" style="s2">former colleagues have claimed what he</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.649" end="00:09:35.759" style="s2">was was totally intolerant of bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.329" end="00:09:37.259" style="s2">he had courage wit and humor depth of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.759" end="00:09:39.689" style="s2">reason and compassion and love for all</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.259" end="00:09:42.089" style="s2">forms of life except perhaps for cowards</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.689" end="00:09:45.029" style="s2">and soulless bureaucrats for which he</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.089" end="00:09:46.829" style="s2">had no love and no patience so just two</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.029" end="00:09:48.180" style="s2">more things about Steve before we use</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.829" end="00:09:51.750" style="s2">this to embark on talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.180" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">what evergreen was more broadly one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.750" end="00:09:55.319" style="s2">my favorite memories of Steve is from</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:56.610" style="s2">sitting around a campfire as so many</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.319" end="00:09:58.949" style="s2">deep and meaningful memories are</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.610" end="00:10:03.000" style="s2">especially from Evergreen it was 2012</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.949" end="00:10:04.889" style="s2">and he and I were at Inova patia a field</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.000" end="00:10:07.709" style="s2">station in Sonora Mexico on the Sea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.889" end="00:10:09.779" style="s2">Cortez Steve at first second students</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.709" end="00:10:13.740" style="s2">had first taken students to this magical</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.779" end="00:10:17.819" style="s2">place its land and water together birds</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.740" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">and mangroves and cactus ten years</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.819" end="00:10:23.220" style="s2">earlier and in the interim his daughter</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:25.110" style="s2">and son-in-law Sally and Adam had turned</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.220" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">it into a small rustic beautiful field</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.110" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">station every year every spring I guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">it was every winter quarter Steve got</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:36.059" style="s2">some number of students something</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:38.430" style="s2">between four and ten to do field work</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.059" end="00:10:39.689" style="s2">down at Nava patia and this year I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.430" end="00:10:41.399" style="s2">sponsoring the contracts of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.689" end="00:10:44.610" style="s2">students and I was able to go down there</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.399" end="00:10:46.730" style="s2">for ten days and I was visiting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.610" end="00:10:49.139" style="s2">students whose work I was overseeing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.730" end="00:10:50.879" style="s2">experiencing firsthand this place that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.139" end="00:10:53.069" style="s2">had heard so much about both from Steve</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.879" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">and just some degree from Sally and Adam</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.069" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">who I didn&#39;t know well at that point but</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:58.870" style="s2">also from the generations of students</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:01.640" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.870" end="00:11:02.960" style="s2">Steve had driven down with a friend Anna</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.640" end="00:11:05.030" style="s2">Steve was already old it was already</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.960" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">retired but he had driven down it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.030" end="00:11:09.530" style="s2">know near the border of Sonora and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:11.000" style="s2">Sinaloa in Mexico and one night after a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.530" end="00:11:13.730" style="s2">full day of field work that we all</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.000" end="00:11:16.430" style="s2">engaged in under a nearly full moon all</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.730" end="00:11:17.990" style="s2">of us sat around a campfire on this thin</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.430" end="00:11:20.450" style="s2">strip of shoreline on the Sea of Cortez</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.990" end="00:11:22.520" style="s2">and passed around a bottle of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.450" end="00:11:25.820" style="s2">lechuguilla which is the local agave</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.520" end="00:11:28.010" style="s2">liquor and played guitar Steve did as</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.820" end="00:11:30.200" style="s2">well as a few of the students and told</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.010" end="00:11:36.110" style="s2">stories and Steve&#39;s stories were always</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.200" end="00:11:38.270" style="s2">full of humor and and bashing of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.110" end="00:11:40.580" style="s2">who needed bashing and honor for those</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.270" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">who deserved honor tales of birds and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.580" end="00:11:46.570" style="s2">people mostly and just just stunning so</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:49.130" style="s2">then in early 2017</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.570" end="00:11:54.140" style="s2">whenever Grimm was blowing up Steve and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.130" end="00:11:56.030" style="s2">I had an interaction on line about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.140" end="00:11:57.890" style="s2">vandalism that had taken place at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.030" end="00:11:59.180" style="s2">Natural History Museum because one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.890" end="00:12:00.950" style="s2">the things that happened during the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.180" end="00:12:04.730" style="s2">protests that turned into riots at</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.950" end="00:12:08.390" style="s2">Evergreen was that some of the activists</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.730" end="00:12:10.130" style="s2">went after not all of campus but</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.390" end="00:12:13.400" style="s2">specifically the science buildings in</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.130" end="00:12:14.900" style="s2">the library and a number of windows were</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.400" end="00:12:17.540" style="s2">smashed at the Natural History Museum</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.900" end="00:12:19.730" style="s2">and in the science labs and other</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.540" end="00:12:22.820" style="s2">vandalism happened at the library and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.730" end="00:12:26.240" style="s2">also at the newly named les purse hall</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.820" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">named for the former president who was</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.240" end="00:12:29.780" style="s2">an excellent president of the college so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:31.730" style="s2">he and I were going back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.780" end="00:12:33.410" style="s2">talking about what to do and how it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.730" end="00:12:34.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t actually even safe to go onto</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.410" end="00:12:36.110" style="s2">campus to do the cleanup but that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.760" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">specimens and the collections were at</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.110" end="00:12:42.170" style="s2">risk and he said with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:44.270" style="s2">anarchy on campus quote I too am in</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.170" end="00:12:45.650" style="s2">disbelief I&#39;ve made some minor efforts</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.270" end="00:12:47.780" style="s2">to find colleagues to join me in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.650" end="00:12:50.090" style="s2">supporting bread silence is a usual</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:59.000" style="s2">thought we had evergreen word Bob yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.940" end="00:13:01.430" style="s2">this is such an important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.000" end="00:13:05.000" style="s2">story of what happened and actually it</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.430" end="00:13:07.700" style="s2">points rather exactly to what I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.000" end="00:13:08.740" style="s2">one of the major themes and lessons of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.700" end="00:13:13.050" style="s2">the entire thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.740" end="00:13:16.660" style="s2">was for me and for us which is that</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.660" end="00:13:23.950" style="s2">both better and worse yeah and we saw</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.589" end="00:13:27.130" style="s2">spectacular examples of both we didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.950" end="00:13:29.080" style="s2">will say we saw much less of it much</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.130" end="00:13:32.410" style="s2">less courage amongst the faculty than I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.080" end="00:13:33.730" style="s2">would have hoped and expected hoped and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.410" end="00:13:35.500" style="s2">expected people that we would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.730" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">counted as friends were absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.500" end="00:13:42.370" style="s2">silent or worse or worse yeah some of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:45.070" style="s2">them were far worse and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.370" end="00:13:47.200" style="s2">troubling thing to discover amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.070" end="00:13:49.930" style="s2">faculty the ones who did stand up some</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.200" end="00:13:54.070" style="s2">very surprising people came to our aid</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.930" end="00:13:55.720" style="s2">but almost all of them retired yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.070" end="00:13:57.490" style="s2">were almost all emeritus which means</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.720" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">that the college had no grasp on them</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.490" end="00:14:01.390" style="s2">anymore well it did but it also meant</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:03.790" style="s2">that they came from an era in which the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.390" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">college was really about something much</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.790" end="00:14:09.459" style="s2">more substantive and anyway I know I got</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:11.470" style="s2">told and I think you got told that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.459" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">were like founding faculty members in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.470" end="00:14:16.690" style="s2">the wrong generation frequently which</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:19.860" style="s2">you know I take to have been a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.690" end="00:14:23.470" style="s2">compliment but anyway the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.860" end="00:14:25.899" style="s2">current faculty did not show up a few of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:27.940" style="s2">them did a very very tiny number like</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.899" end="00:14:29.560" style="s2">Paris in particular is the one whose</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.940" end="00:14:30.910" style="s2">name most people will know if they know</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.560" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">any of them but there were a few others</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.910" end="00:14:33.610" style="s2">there were a few and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:37.540" style="s2">academic staff as well so I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.610" end="00:14:39.310" style="s2">say Amex staff staff were more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.540" end="00:14:41.649" style="s2">stand up even though they were far less</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.310" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">safe than the tenured faculty yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.649" end="00:14:45.730" style="s2">then the people who shined the brightest</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">were students so a hundred percent a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.730" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">huge fraction of our students and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.510" style="s2">really a majority of our students we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:55.959" style="s2">heard from and where were actively</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.510" end="00:14:57.700" style="s2">trying to to fight this thing and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.959" end="00:14:59.110" style="s2">course heard from many other students</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.700" end="00:15:00.970" style="s2">and you know many of you will be</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.110" end="00:15:03.579" style="s2">familiar with Benjamin Boyce who we came</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.970" end="00:15:05.529" style="s2">to know in the aftermath of this and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.579" end="00:15:08.230" style="s2">has done stunning work documenting what</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.529" end="00:15:11.220" style="s2">happened in the year or two leading up</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.230" end="00:15:15.370" style="s2">to it and what happened afterwards and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.220" end="00:15:16.810" style="s2">you know that that points to the student</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.370" end="00:15:19.329" style="s2">body that actually did exist at</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.810" end="00:15:21.100" style="s2">Evergreen that Evergreen has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.329" end="00:15:21.620" style="s2">mocked for instance for having an</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.100" end="00:15:25.460" style="s2">accepted</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.620" end="00:15:28.820" style="s2">policy that was like 99% often 98 99 %</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.460" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">and it always felt to us like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.820" end="00:15:33.589" style="s2">actually was a positive thing that no</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:34.820" style="s2">this was not a selective college it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.589" end="00:15:36.380" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a highly selective college or</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.820" end="00:15:38.839" style="s2">even a fairly a selective College by</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.380" end="00:15:40.580" style="s2">most measures but what it allowed and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.839" end="00:15:42.830" style="s2">you know sure there were people who came</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.580" end="00:15:44.660" style="s2">to the door that were not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.830" end="00:15:46.370" style="s2">actually doing any kind of work that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.660" end="00:15:48.520" style="s2">useful and for the most part we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.370" end="00:15:51.350" style="s2">see those because over in the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.520" end="00:15:53.870" style="s2">students who really were not interested</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.350" end="00:15:56.300" style="s2">in doing any work or or capable didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:59.690" style="s2">even show up but we had so many students</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.300" end="00:16:01.190" style="s2">who had been failed by school and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.690" end="00:16:03.020" style="s2">were many of them were told that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.190" end="00:16:06.500" style="s2">had failed school but I will say no they</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.020" end="00:16:09.470" style="s2">were failed by school and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.500" end="00:16:11.390" style="s2">came in to our classrooms saying I know</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.470" end="00:16:14.660" style="s2">I&#39;m dumb because I&#39;ve been told I&#39;m dumb</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.390" end="00:16:15.830" style="s2">all my life by teachers and not a single</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.660" end="00:16:18.589" style="s2">student who ever came to me and said</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.830" end="00:16:23.300" style="s2">that was dumb or incapable or lazy or</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.589" end="00:16:25.760" style="s2">incoherent or or incapable of developing</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.300" end="00:16:29.060" style="s2">you know deep critical thinking on</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.760" end="00:16:30.920" style="s2">issues evolutionary and beyond so I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.060" end="00:16:32.089" style="s2">to there are a lot of things wrapped up</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.920" end="00:16:34.490" style="s2">in what you just said and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.089" end="00:16:36.500" style="s2">highlight a few of them yeah one thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.490" end="00:16:38.930" style="s2">is the lack of selectivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.500" end="00:16:40.790" style="s2">college produced two populations inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.930" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">the college and the two populations have</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.790" end="00:16:46.279" style="s2">everything to do with what unfolded yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:48.709" style="s2">so you had people who showed up there</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.279" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">because it was the College of last</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.709" end="00:16:51.700" style="s2">resort they could get in they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:53.690" style="s2">get in somewhere else and many of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.700" end="00:16:55.459" style="s2">largely through no fault of their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.690" end="00:16:57.830" style="s2">through the failure of the schools that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.459" end="00:16:59.990" style="s2">they had come from didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.830" end="00:17:02.830" style="s2">skills to do the work and then there</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.990" end="00:17:06.470" style="s2">were there was a large population of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.830" end="00:17:07.880" style="s2">misfits and oddballs and unusual people</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.470" end="00:17:11.179" style="s2">people just who didn&#39;t have a taste for</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.880" end="00:17:13.040" style="s2">the elite colleges and we saw them all</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.179" end="00:17:15.350" style="s2">and because you know it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.040" end="00:17:18.439" style="s2">thing to say but because you and I were</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.350" end="00:17:20.780" style="s2">both very very popular our classes</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.439" end="00:17:22.459" style="s2">overflowed there were more we never</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.780" end="00:17:23.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a waitlist never done with</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.459" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">this climbing of enrollment when</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.720" end="00:17:26.839" style="s2">everyone else is having nearly everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:30.050" style="s2">else having a hard time filling classes</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.839" end="00:17:33.320" style="s2">we had waitlist and what this meant</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.050" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">oddly we weren&#39;t in most cases except in</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.320" end="00:17:38.030" style="s2">the rare case of study abroad in most</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:40.370" style="s2">cases we were not allowed to decide who</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.030" end="00:17:43.309" style="s2">came into our classes but there was if a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:47.480" style="s2">backdoor mechanism and we used it so</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.309" end="00:17:49.730" style="s2">there was this tradition that before any</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.480" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">term began which the thing called</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.730" end="00:17:53.419" style="s2">academic fair in which you could sit</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:54.679" style="s2">down with any professor you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.419" end="00:17:57.410" style="s2">and talk to them about the program that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.679" end="00:17:59.299" style="s2">we&#39;re teaching and before registration</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.410" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">happened so yes this is a way for</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.299" end="00:18:03.799" style="s2">students to hate the consumer metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:05.960" style="s2">here but shop for the full-time program</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.799" end="00:18:07.160" style="s2">that they would be taking for a quarter</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.960" end="00:18:08.179" style="s2">or two quarters or three quarters and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.160" end="00:18:09.860" style="s2">this was a month or so before</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.179" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">registration or you know a day before</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.860" end="00:18:13.370" style="s2">registration a month or more before</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:15.620" style="s2">classes started so when students asked</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:16.820" style="s2">us for advice we told them a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.620" end="00:18:18.679" style="s2">stuff we would tell them whether the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.820" end="00:18:20.540" style="s2">program they were considering taking was</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.679" end="00:18:23.630" style="s2">likely to be any good but the key thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.540" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">was it made all the difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.630" end="00:18:26.540" style="s2">world who was teaching a good professor</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:27.740" style="s2">who was teaching something you maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.540" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">weren&#39;t that interested in would</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.740" end="00:18:31.910" style="s2">probably give you something of high</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:32.990" style="s2">value a terrible professor who was</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.910" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">teaching something that you were</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.990" end="00:18:35.809" style="s2">nominally interested in was very</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:37.940" style="s2">unlikely to teach you anything and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.809" end="00:18:39.500" style="s2">you&#39;re reliable to feel because these</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.940" end="00:18:42.530" style="s2">were full-time programs you&#39;re reliable</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.500" end="00:18:44.660" style="s2">to feel trapped so anyway the academic</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.530" end="00:18:48.140" style="s2">fair was like an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.660" end="00:18:50.030" style="s2">interview professors but I also took it</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.140" end="00:18:51.290" style="s2">and you took it as a opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.030" end="00:18:53.630" style="s2">interview students and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.290" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">whether or not they were a good fit and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.630" end="00:18:57.559" style="s2">in my case in particular often they</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.179" style="s2">weren&#39;t because I wasn&#39;t that normal</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.559" end="00:19:01.970" style="s2">kind of professor and so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.179" end="00:19:04.130" style="s2">might have to be ready for my deficits</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.970" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">and if you were prepared for them there</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.130" end="00:19:10.130" style="s2">was a lot you could get out of it but</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:11.630" style="s2">but in any case by discouraging students</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.130" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">who wouldn&#39;t be a good fit for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.630" end="00:19:15.770" style="s2">program and encouraging those who would</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">be a good fit and in my case I always</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.770" end="00:19:23.179" style="s2">let in a few extras people who showed</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:25.580" style="s2">particular promise but didn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.179" end="00:19:27.380" style="s2">didn&#39;t register in time or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.580" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t make it into the class I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.380" end="00:19:31.190" style="s2">left those in and this would adjust the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:33.350" style="s2">the character of the room the room would</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.190" end="00:19:35.419" style="s2">be really high quality and my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.350" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">was as long as you had one person in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.419" end="00:19:39.620" style="s2">room was willing to volley with you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:41.960" style="s2">could teach the others to do it and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.620" end="00:19:42.980" style="s2">could get a really great teaching</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.960" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.980" end="00:19:49.220" style="s2">up and running pretty quickly absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:52.340" style="s2">so anyway that created an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.220" end="00:19:55.190" style="s2">for us to build a community of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.340" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">who were super high-caliber even in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.190" end="00:19:58.910" style="s2">college that wasn&#39;t selective right we</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:02.059" style="s2">weren&#39;t allowed to be formally selected</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.910" end="00:20:04.490" style="s2">but informally it happened and this in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.059" end="00:20:07.790" style="s2">we also in students would often show it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.490" end="00:20:09.980" style="s2">from past programs and sit in on one or</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.790" end="00:20:11.179" style="s2">more many weeks of classes simply</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.980" end="00:20:12.530" style="s2">because they wanted to continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.179" end="00:20:13.940" style="s2">part of the conversation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.530" end="00:20:17.450" style="s2">having the ongoing evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.940" end="00:20:20.030" style="s2">conversation and so having these having</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.450" end="00:20:23.450" style="s2">these basically alums of our programs in</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.030" end="00:20:24.919" style="s2">the room very often also raised the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.450" end="00:20:27.380" style="s2">level of discussion in the room oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.919" end="00:20:28.549" style="s2">absolutely they functioned like TAS and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:30.169" style="s2">they were there just because they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.549" end="00:20:31.400" style="s2">hungry to find the community was still</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.169" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">having the conversation that they had</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.400" end="00:20:36.620" style="s2">benefited from I late in the game found</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:38.380" style="s2">out that there was a proper term for</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.620" end="00:20:41.179" style="s2">this which I borrowed from Steve Jobs</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.380" end="00:20:45.230" style="s2">Steve Jobs who famously dropped out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.179" end="00:20:47.000" style="s2">was it read yeah I think I think a Steve</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.230" end="00:20:49.100" style="s2">Jobs dropped out of college but he</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.000" end="00:20:50.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t stop going and I kept going was</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.100" end="00:20:52.370" style="s2">trying to save his parents their tuition</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.840" end="00:20:53.929" style="s2">money but he wasn&#39;t interested in not</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.370" end="00:20:56.510" style="s2">learning and so he went and just took</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.929" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">what he wanted so he called himself a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.510" end="00:21:01.370" style="s2">drop in write and these students who</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:05.090" style="s2">came back to our programs became</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.370" end="00:21:07.820" style="s2">drop-ins and in any case it created a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.090" end="00:21:09.590" style="s2">couple of things one it created a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.820" end="00:21:12.610" style="s2">delightful teaching environment for us</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.590" end="00:21:16.390" style="s2">which I think made us a little bit less</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.610" end="00:21:18.140" style="s2">aware of just how bad things were</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.390" end="00:21:21.140" style="s2">descending into madness</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.140" end="00:21:23.090" style="s2">in the larger College because our</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.140" end="00:21:25.700" style="s2">community was healthy the larger</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.090" end="00:21:27.230" style="s2">communities descent into madness was I</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.700" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">mean we were aware of it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.230" end="00:21:31.340" style="s2">think we were as alarmed as we should</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.600" end="00:21:35.540" style="s2">have been which meant that it until the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.340" end="00:21:37.309" style="s2">last year it would have caught us off</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.540" end="00:21:39.169" style="s2">guard although I do remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.309" end="00:21:40.520" style="s2">conversation certainly between us and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.169" end="00:21:43.130" style="s2">few of our other colleagues who were</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.520" end="00:21:45.350" style="s2">saying you know students remain amazing</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.130" end="00:21:47.270" style="s2">what we can do with the curriculum and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.350" end="00:21:49.700" style="s2">with education with this model is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.270" end="00:21:51.500" style="s2">amazing but when I come on to campus I</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.700" end="00:21:54.169" style="s2">just keep my head down and go from my</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.500" end="00:21:55.610" style="s2">classroom to my office and home I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.169" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">want it increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.610" end="00:22:00.940" style="s2">we were fighting over the last several</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:02.860" style="s2">years that are our supposed peers or</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.940" end="00:22:05.059" style="s2">going off the rails</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.860" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">our supposin peers were going off the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.059" end="00:22:07.940" style="s2">rails going after each other and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:10.730" style="s2">good ones were keeping their head down</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.940" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">mm-hm actually maybe as long as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.730" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">here can we look at some of those</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">pictures from our sure you got these</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:17.270" style="s2">stuff I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:19.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve got us got in store so let me</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.270" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">just set this up a little bit so Heather</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.730" end="00:22:25.490" style="s2">became excellent at creating study</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:27.679" style="s2">abroad programs at a price that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.490" end="00:22:29.210" style="s2">unheard of and the price really</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.679" end="00:22:31.640" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t matter except that what it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.210" end="00:22:33.559" style="s2">meant was that a range of students could</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.640" end="00:22:35.320" style="s2">go on the study abroad programs who</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.559" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">never would have been able to afford it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.320" end="00:22:39.530" style="s2">at a normal college doing this at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.480" style="s2">normal rate the price was incredibly low</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.530" end="00:22:42.740" style="s2">it was incredibly late and and I worked</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.480" end="00:22:44.929" style="s2">with them to the students who were</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.740" end="00:22:48.230" style="s2">eligible for Pell grants I worked with</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.929" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">them to get them some some funds</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.230" end="00:22:53.450" style="s2">basically scholarships that over half of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:55.130" style="s2">my students who applied every time I did</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.450" end="00:22:57.020" style="s2">study abroad got these such that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.130" end="00:22:59.390" style="s2">actually went into debt very little for</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.020" end="00:23:01.160" style="s2">the experience of a six eight eleven</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.390" end="00:23:03.230" style="s2">week study abroad in Panama or Ecuador</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.160" end="00:23:04.940" style="s2">right so these things were inexpensive</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.230" end="00:23:05.990" style="s2">which meant they were more diverse than</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.940" end="00:23:09.620" style="s2">they would otherwise be</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.990" end="00:23:11.090" style="s2">they were intensive you got them helped</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.620" end="00:23:16.490" style="s2">you worked with them to be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.090" end="00:23:17.630" style="s2">and they were also just much better than</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.490" end="00:23:21.049" style="s2">you would be able to source anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.630" end="00:23:22.490" style="s2">else so the final one the one I went on</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.049" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">with you I didn&#39;t that we did together</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.490" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">yes we did together and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:29.090" style="s2">plenty good at showing up and teaching</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:30.860" style="s2">but I was not responsible for making</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.090" end="00:23:32.660" style="s2">this happen that was I was all Heather</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.860" end="00:23:34.610" style="s2">but it was it was a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.660" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">experience I mean all of my study</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.610" end="00:23:40.460" style="s2">Abroad&#39;s were amazing and flawed and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:43.190" style="s2">inglorious but this last one that we did</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.460" end="00:23:45.860" style="s2">together was the two of us our two</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.190" end="00:23:48.350" style="s2">children 30 students 30 s&#39;tel Evan weeks</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.860" end="00:23:50.809" style="s2">when I could have been with all years so</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.350" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">we had learned so again Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.809" end="00:23:55.160" style="s2">classes are full-time or at least they</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:57.290" style="s2">were full-time which meant you the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.160" end="00:23:59.240" style="s2">professor teaches one class students</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.290" end="00:24:01.880" style="s2">take one class you&#39;re with each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.240" end="00:24:03.559" style="s2">full-time it&#39;s your job as we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.880" end="00:24:05.780" style="s2">been in the field with them in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.559" end="00:24:09.320" style="s2">Pacific Northwest for a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.780" end="00:24:11.240" style="s2">we&#39;d really seen them and we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.320" end="00:24:12.710" style="s2">elected them from all of the applicants</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.240" end="00:24:15.019" style="s2">to get to the 50 that we started with in</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.710" end="00:24:17.720" style="s2">the fall and then we trimmed that number</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.019" end="00:24:20.659" style="s2">farther to travel with 30 students to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.720" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">Ecuador for 11 weeks in January through</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.659" end="00:24:28.669" style="s2">April of 2016 and for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:30.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know Ecuador Ecuador is a small</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.669" end="00:24:32.899" style="s2">country by some measures but it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.820" end="00:24:35.210" style="s2">terrifically diverse not only does it</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.899" end="00:24:37.549" style="s2">contain the most diverse habitat on</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.210" end="00:24:40.279" style="s2">earth as far as we know in the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.549" end="00:24:42.710" style="s2">one of the places that we visited but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.279" end="00:24:45.769" style="s2">also has you know the Altiplano high and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.710" end="00:24:48.259" style="s2">the Andes it&#39;s got cloud forests it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.769" end="00:24:51.110" style="s2">got an amazing diversity of habitats and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.259" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">creatures and cultures and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.110" end="00:24:56.059" style="s2">it&#39;s a spectacular place and to spend oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:58.399" style="s2">and the Galapagos of course to spend</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.059" end="00:25:00.860" style="s2">eleven weeks touring with students that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.399" end="00:25:02.450" style="s2">you know really well who are you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.860" end="00:25:04.539" style="s2">because this was evergreen we were</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.450" end="00:25:06.350" style="s2">biologists but we were teaching about</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.539" end="00:25:08.179" style="s2">paleoanthropology we were teaching about</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.350" end="00:25:11.929" style="s2">evolutionary ecology we were teaching</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.179" end="00:25:15.529" style="s2">about evolutionary dynamics and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.929" end="00:25:17.330" style="s2">history and and modern cultural norms</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.529" end="00:25:20.809" style="s2">and expectations in Ecuador as well and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.330" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">so we got to basically use Ecuador as</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.809" end="00:25:25.309" style="s2">the test case for all of these things we</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:26.929" style="s2">could go look at it so anyway this was</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.309" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">happening the year before</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.929" end="00:25:31.820" style="s2">evergreen came apart now we want you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:33.889" style="s2">see what evergreen looked like when it</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.820" end="00:25:36.379" style="s2">was firing on all cylinders so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.889" end="00:25:39.649" style="s2">let&#39;s put up some some photos all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.379" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">well I&#39;m going to set this image up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.649" end="00:25:44.029" style="s2">then hopefully Zak will be able to put</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:49.309" style="s2">it on the screen for you the image is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.029" end="00:25:51.860" style="s2">picture of 30 students plus Zak with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.309" end="00:25:55.639" style="s2">bus in kind of the distant background</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.860" end="00:25:58.370" style="s2">and these students are experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.639" end="00:26:01.370" style="s2">something utterly remarkable now what</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.370" end="00:26:04.190" style="s2">has just happened is these students have</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.370" end="00:26:08.210" style="s2">just encountered the headwaters of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.190" end="00:26:11.090" style="s2">Amazon they have just crossed into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.210" end="00:26:14.779" style="s2">watershed that becomes hundreds of miles</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.090" end="00:26:17.750" style="s2">away the Amazon River and where they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.779" end="00:26:19.610" style="s2">standing it is but a trickle behind them</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.750" end="00:26:21.260" style="s2">you can see the first Cecropia trees</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.610" end="00:26:22.220" style="s2">they&#39;ve ever encountered these will</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.260" end="00:26:25.010" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.220" end="00:26:26.330" style="s2">a very common feature of our discussions</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.010" end="00:26:28.520" style="s2">because there&#39;s such an important</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.330" end="00:26:30.620" style="s2">feature of tropical forests but in any</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.520" end="00:26:33.020" style="s2">case they&#39;re up here in the clouds in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.620" end="00:26:35.419" style="s2">this cold location watching you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.020" end="00:26:39.580" style="s2">essentially the process that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.419" end="00:26:42.470" style="s2">Amazon at its very beginning and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.580" end="00:26:44.030" style="s2">excited you can see that these are</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.470" end="00:26:45.830" style="s2">students that are happy to be having</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.030" end="00:26:49.789" style="s2">this experience they didn&#39;t expect it</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.830" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">but they&#39;re excited by what they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.789" end="00:26:55.850" style="s2">to actually walk up to and touch it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:59.299" style="s2">such an amazing picture it really takes</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.850" end="00:27:00.440" style="s2">me back and we&#39;ve heard from two of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.299" end="00:27:03.730" style="s2">people in this picture in the last</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.440" end="00:27:06.230" style="s2">couple of days with regard to this being</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.730" end="00:27:07.610" style="s2">an anniversary that&#39;s coming up and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.230" end="00:27:10.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve been in touch of course with</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.610" end="00:27:12.020" style="s2">another we work with on a regular basis</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.020" end="00:27:15.400" style="s2">the people in this photo we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.700" end="00:27:18.429" style="s2">been in touch with in the last week and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.400" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">you know probably another ten of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.429" end="00:27:25.460" style="s2">we&#39;re in regular contact with so in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:28.010" style="s2">for those of you who are watching and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">not just listening the woman kneeling in</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.010" end="00:27:32.870" style="s2">the front row is Odette who will come up</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.460" style="s2">here in a couple of other photos she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.870" end="00:27:35.929" style="s2">good friend of ours we&#39;ve seen her</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.929" end="00:27:41.390" style="s2">but anyway her story actually tells the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.679" end="00:27:44.570" style="s2">story of what happened at evergreens so</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.390" end="00:27:47.270" style="s2">well that anyway I think we just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.570" end="00:27:51.830" style="s2">avoid exploring it so let&#39;s go a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.270" end="00:27:54.260" style="s2">further here so this image is of Heather</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.830" end="00:27:56.299" style="s2">and Zack and Toby although Zack is</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.260" end="00:27:58.760" style="s2">barely recognizable in this photo and a</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.299" end="00:28:00.260" style="s2">student of ours who we&#39;ve run into this</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.760" end="00:28:02.299" style="s2">is carnival this is the night before</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:03.980" style="s2">carnival which is the the night of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.980" end="00:28:10.909" style="s2">and the tradition in in Ecuador</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.169" end="00:28:13.309" style="s2">basically is for people to run around</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.909" end="00:28:16.820" style="s2">like madmen spray each other with foam</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.309" end="00:28:18.500" style="s2">and anyway our students have taken to</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.820" end="00:28:21.409" style="s2">this and they&#39;re participating and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.500" end="00:28:23.659" style="s2">participating and this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.409" end="00:28:24.909" style="s2">cultural lesson and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.659" end="00:28:27.169" style="s2">know that the foam tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.909" end="00:28:28.760" style="s2">wonderful or absurd or whatever it might</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.169" end="00:28:30.710" style="s2">be but it&#39;s the reality of what takes</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.760" end="00:28:33.070" style="s2">place in this beautiful colonial city in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.710" end="00:28:34.750" style="s2">Ecuador</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.070" end="00:28:38.470" style="s2">you know here we are having run into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.750" end="00:28:42.730" style="s2">student who&#39;s obviously fully integrated</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.470" end="00:28:45.580" style="s2">himself into this tradition yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.730" end="00:28:47.740" style="s2">see that&#39;s maybe the hat factor yet all</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.940" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">ecuador and so we saw the whole process</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.620" end="00:29:09.299" style="s2">of how they made hats again Odette</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:15.730" style="s2">here&#39;s front and center</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.049" end="00:29:36.820" style="s2">cold anyway in a really magical place</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.710" end="00:29:41.590" style="s2">and I think we have a picture of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.820" end="00:29:44.379" style="s2">see another picture all right so here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.379" end="00:29:52.509" style="s2">now I hate to do this because in some</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.759" end="00:29:56.590" style="s2">sense I don&#39;t want to sully cajas</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.509" end="00:29:59.259" style="s2">national park or the wonderful reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.590" end="00:30:00.850" style="s2">of Odette with the terrible thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.259" end="00:30:03.820" style="s2">happened to her in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.850" end="00:30:06.580" style="s2">parallel to what happened to us you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.820" end="00:30:08.110" style="s2">we were teaching in a way that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.580" end="00:30:10.990" style="s2">extremely rewarding and then something</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.110" end="00:30:13.990" style="s2">monstrous came for us but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.990" end="00:30:17.409" style="s2">should read something that did not</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.990" end="00:30:19.809" style="s2">intend for this to be public but I did</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.409" end="00:30:22.570" style="s2">ask her if it was okay if I read part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.809" end="00:30:25.179" style="s2">what she wrote I will try to adjust it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.570" end="00:30:27.909" style="s2">so that it makes sense so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.179" end="00:30:29.980" style="s2">discussing and when did she write this</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.909" end="00:30:32.019" style="s2">she she sent it to me out of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.980" end="00:30:34.629" style="s2">this morning oh this is today yeah she</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.019" end="00:30:37.149" style="s2">she was realizing that it was the third</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.629" end="00:30:38.710" style="s2">anniversary of May 23rd and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.149" end="00:30:41.590" style="s2">important to her for the same reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.710" end="00:30:43.610" style="s2">it&#39;s important to us yeah so you know a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.590" end="00:30:49.270" style="s2">year after she was here in</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.610" end="00:30:52.160" style="s2">National Park she is discussing the</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.160" end="00:30:58.220" style="s2">president of the college has ostensibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.299" end="00:31:00.920" style="s2">agreed to address the concerns that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.220" end="00:31:02.450" style="s2">students have advanced and she says that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.920" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">some left the address with confidence</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.450" end="00:31:06.140" style="s2">and assurance leaving the rest with even</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:08.030" style="s2">more confusion in questions but as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.140" end="00:31:10.130" style="s2">know there was no room for questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.030" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">these activists were acting as if they</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.130" end="00:31:14.390" style="s2">were bored they wanted something to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:16.190" style="s2">all in all students were upset that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.390" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">had failed at college and decided to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.190" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">the institution to pay for their</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:22.250" style="s2">shortcomings</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.340" end="00:32:40.340" style="s2">along with the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.299" end="00:32:42.590" style="s2">I was either deemed a lost soul a</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.030" end="00:32:53.240" style="s2">will never understand is how people</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.500" end="00:32:55.190" style="s2">cannot think for themselves no matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.240" end="00:32:56.519" style="s2">where you fall you must be able to think</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.190" end="00:32:58.289" style="s2">this is a college</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.519" end="00:33:00.029" style="s2">there are supposed to be thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.289" end="00:33:03.419" style="s2">thinkers present what happened to them</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.029" end="00:33:06.359" style="s2">where did they go that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.419" end="00:33:09.269" style="s2">yes he Oded I know it&#39;s it&#39;s so dead and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.359" end="00:33:11.309" style="s2">so he had never heard though she and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.269" end="00:33:13.259" style="s2">and I have talked a lot many many many</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.309" end="00:33:16.499" style="s2">hours and the three years since</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.259" end="00:33:18.239" style="s2">Evergreen blew up and I&#39;d never the one</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.499" end="00:33:21.149" style="s2">thing in there I hadn&#39;t heard before was</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.239" end="00:33:24.179" style="s2">that other students who weren&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.149" end="00:33:27.269" style="s2">the protests avoided her were scared of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.179" end="00:33:31.700" style="s2">her because of her color because of her</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.269" end="00:33:34.859" style="s2">skin color it&#39;s astounding it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.700" end="00:33:38.119" style="s2">upsetting feature of this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.859" end="00:33:41.759" style="s2">because I mean I must tell you I learned</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.119" end="00:33:43.019" style="s2">something about race from our debt as</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.759" end="00:33:48.809" style="s2">I&#39;ve mentioned elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.019" end="00:33:50.999" style="s2">I took a debt to be black but in talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.809" end="00:33:57.059" style="s2">to her about and she was very open with</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.999" end="00:33:59.609" style="s2">us you know her family is a rather must</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.059" end="00:34:02.279" style="s2">as a Caribbean African rivers European</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.609" end="00:34:05.190" style="s2">debt is of European descent and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.279" end="00:34:07.109" style="s2">is as one can easily imagine once</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.190" end="00:34:09.240" style="s2">somebody points you to it in her case</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.109" end="00:34:11.639" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t feel black or not black</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.240" end="00:34:14.700" style="s2">these are the two sides of her family</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.639" end="00:34:18.750" style="s2">and you know that you know if one does</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.700" end="00:34:20.190" style="s2">not default to mother or father or one</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.750" end="00:34:22.500" style="s2">way of thinking or the other the point</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.190" end="00:34:24.569" style="s2">is that&#39;s the nature of the way human</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.500" end="00:34:26.309" style="s2">beings are she&#39;s just she&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.569" end="00:34:29.700" style="s2">extraordinary human being who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.309" end="00:34:32.849" style="s2">scientist and a ballerina and a writer</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.700" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">and an artist and brilliant at</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.849" end="00:34:37.770" style="s2">phylogenetic trees and at fieldwork and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:39.299" style="s2">it&#39;s and and she was actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.770" end="00:34:40.529" style="s2">students who came to Evergreen entirely</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.299" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">of her own volition she could have</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.529" end="00:34:44.849" style="s2">gotten in nearly anywhere she she was an</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:46.679" style="s2">excellent student and not because she</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.849" end="00:34:48.690" style="s2">was a follower she but because she was</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.679" end="00:34:50.339" style="s2">just an excellent student who was</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.690" end="00:34:52.919" style="s2">creative and hardworking and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.339" end="00:34:54.359" style="s2">analytically beyond competent she came</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.919" end="00:34:58.230" style="s2">to Evergreen because she loved the model</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.359" end="00:34:58.890" style="s2">and so you know she was not a misfit in</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.230" end="00:35:02.789" style="s2">any way</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.890" end="00:35:04.319" style="s2">arriving in our classroom and boy at</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.789" end="00:35:06.329" style="s2">this point the point this picture was</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.319" end="00:35:08.759" style="s2">taken she had been my student</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.329" end="00:35:09.940" style="s2">consistently for almost two full years</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.759" end="00:35:11.740" style="s2">and yours for only</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.940" end="00:35:14.319" style="s2">one quarter less than that yeah I met</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.740" end="00:35:15.790" style="s2">her and as with so many of the students</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.319" end="00:35:17.770" style="s2">including almost all the ones who are in</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.790" end="00:35:20.770" style="s2">that boat accident with me later in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.770" end="00:35:23.109" style="s2">same trip there as they entered college</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:26.650" style="s2">for the first time the Ashman in college</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.109" end="00:35:29.349" style="s2">and so this this highlights one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.650" end="00:35:32.410" style="s2">things so Odette was simultaneously a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.349" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">student of ours and a friend of ours and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.410" end="00:35:37.569" style="s2">these two things were not in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:40.119" style="s2">she put her trust in us for good reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.569" end="00:35:43.240" style="s2">I think and it paid off for her but this</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.119" end="00:35:46.089" style="s2">did not mean that we couldn&#39;t also be</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.240" end="00:35:48.550" style="s2">friends and so she shows up all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.089" end="00:35:51.430" style="s2">places those of us who&#39;ve been following</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.550" end="00:35:54.550" style="s2">us carefully will know of the terrible</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.430" end="00:35:57.160" style="s2">boat accident that you were you were in</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.550" end="00:36:00.460" style="s2">Odette was in the boat accident with you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.160" end="00:36:02.710" style="s2">was badly injured as you were the day</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.460" end="00:36:05.500" style="s2">before that boat accident she and I had</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.710" end="00:36:07.720" style="s2">walked down the face of this crater</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.500" end="00:36:10.359" style="s2">together the class had been looking at</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.720" end="00:36:12.130" style="s2">this volcanic crater and we had spent I</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.359" end="00:36:13.569" style="s2">don&#39;t know a half an hour or an hour</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.130" end="00:36:16.170" style="s2">involved in conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.569" end="00:36:20.770" style="s2">remember what it was but I do remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.170" end="00:36:22.390" style="s2">how fun it was walking down this crater</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.770" end="00:36:25.450" style="s2">with her and remarking on the biology</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.390" end="00:36:27.160" style="s2">that was there and talking about lives I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.450" end="00:36:30.010" style="s2">think she was talking to me she loves</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.160" end="00:36:33.250" style="s2">live theater and she was talking to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.010" end="00:36:38.380" style="s2">about some of her favorites but and also</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.250" end="00:36:41.530" style="s2">she shows up on the day of absence I did</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.380" end="00:36:43.060" style="s2">not have class it was a Wednesday and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.530" end="00:36:45.310" style="s2">did not have class scheduled but I had</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.060" end="00:36:47.020" style="s2">said in the letter that became famous I</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.310" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">had said you should expect to find me on</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.020" end="00:36:55.150" style="s2">campus and I didn&#39;t want not to live up</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.210" end="00:36:57.220" style="s2">to it so I went to campus and I ran into</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.150" end="00:36:59.260" style="s2">Odette and we went and had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.220" end="00:37:03.910" style="s2">conversation for an hour and I later</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.260" end="00:37:06.250" style="s2">asked her if she had arranged to find me</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.910" end="00:37:08.740" style="s2">to keep me out of trouble and she said</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.250" end="00:37:10.119" style="s2">no it hadn&#39;t even occurred to her and in</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.740" end="00:37:12.569" style="s2">fact we didn&#39;t even talk about they have</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.119" end="00:37:15.130" style="s2">absence it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t a worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.569" end="00:37:17.980" style="s2">type of conversation from our</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.130" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">perspective yeah so do you want to like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.980" end="00:37:20.920" style="s2">to take this down you want to show a few</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">more pictures before we move let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.920" end="00:37:25.110" style="s2">move to a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:27.960" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s look at this one all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.110" end="00:37:31.800" style="s2">this is a picture of students involved</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.960" end="00:37:34.890" style="s2">in a mud fight in the Napo River I love</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.800" end="00:37:40.350" style="s2">this one I love this moment so the Napo</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.890" end="00:37:42.030" style="s2">is a tributary of the Amazon and later</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.350" end="00:37:43.470" style="s2">in the trip we will find ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.030" end="00:37:45.060" style="s2">different part of the Amazon and another</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.470" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">tributary called the Shira Puna a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.060" end="00:37:52.110" style="s2">tributary of the Napo but anyway here</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:54.120" style="s2">these guys are they&#39;re having a mud</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.580" end="00:38:03.090" style="s2">they&#39;re learning yes this act this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.230" end="00:38:05.100" style="s2">education this is the picture when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.090" end="00:38:06.690" style="s2">wrote that New York Times op-ed on</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.100" end="00:38:08.790" style="s2">nature being risky and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.690" end="00:38:10.080" style="s2">students and everyone need it this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.790" end="00:38:12.000" style="s2">the picture that I&#39;d hoped could</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.080" end="00:38:13.470" style="s2">accompany it but it turns out that if</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.000" end="00:38:14.760" style="s2">you&#39;re writing about college students</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.470" end="00:38:17.340" style="s2">that they have college students do the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.760" end="00:38:22.440" style="s2">art for the piece so it wasn&#39;t an option</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.340" end="00:38:24.780" style="s2">but this this qualifies as some of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.440" end="00:38:26.040" style="s2">highly educational work that these</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.780" end="00:38:27.720" style="s2">students were doing and of course they</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.040" end="00:38:29.220" style="s2">also did field work and they took data</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.720" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">and they did analysis and they reported</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.220" end="00:38:33.210" style="s2">them out to us and often by candlelight</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:35.340" style="s2">all swatting at mosquitoes in remote</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">places with you know no doors or screens</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.340" end="00:38:45.600" style="s2">or running water but this - they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.180" end="00:38:49.560" style="s2">having fun and learning okay what else</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.600" end="00:38:57.660" style="s2">done all right here maybe that&#39;s oh I</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.560" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">guess let&#39;s see that&#39;s a picture that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:05.090" end="00:39:11.990" style="s2">picture of carhops this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.910" end="00:39:15.030" style="s2">it&#39;s Lucas leading a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.990" end="00:39:18.750" style="s2">Lucas who I also feel like they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.750" end="00:39:24.680" style="s2">really appreciated the the unusual model</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.510" end="00:39:27.450" style="s2">and then maybe the last thing that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.500" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">here but what happened to Odette being</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:27.510" style="s2">think it makes sense to spend just a</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.490" end="00:40:56.309" style="s2">here she is being confronted by violent</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.020" end="00:41:06.030" style="s2">which is the whole college should have</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:16.619" style="s2">something about it just strikes me as</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.359" end="00:41:36.049" style="s2">think I wanted to share something from</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.660" end="00:48:53.850" style="s2">the scenes thing that he wasn&#39;t supposed</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:48:56.190" style="s2">to reveal was really the core organizing</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.850" end="00:48:57.960" style="s2">principle of this thing oh my god that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.190" end="00:49:01.710" style="s2">right and wrong has been replaced by</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.630" end="00:49:56.190" style="s2">and only when spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.990" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">yeah i I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good I did</p>

<p begin="00:50:01.080" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">point is made lightly yeah that inside</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.320" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">the school it was a pressure cooker for</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">the last year right and there were many</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:18.840" style="s2">there many students some on staff fewer</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:22.890" style="s2">on faculty fewer on out but although</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.840" end="00:50:25.550" style="s2">there were few brave people on admin who</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.890" end="00:50:29.490" style="s2">were watching the thing and could not</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.550" end="00:50:32.520" style="s2">figure out how to stop it admin had some</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.490" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">power should have but you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.520" end="00:50:38.910" style="s2">more than anyone you were</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:42.760" style="s2">you were trying everything possible and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.910" end="00:50:45.160" style="s2">it was unstoppable and they said so in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.760" end="00:50:48.670" style="s2">as many words in as many ways there</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.160" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">began to be a cabal of first a couple</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.670" end="00:50:55.720" style="s2">and ultimately a good 10 or 14 faculty</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:58.359" style="s2">members who every time you wrote any</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.720" end="00:51:01.450" style="s2">email to the staff faculty thread the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.359" end="00:51:03.970" style="s2">old staff faculty thread they would</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.450" end="00:51:05.799" style="s2">respond almost as a unit and just pile</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.970" end="00:51:07.990" style="s2">on and accuse you of all the things</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.799" end="00:51:11.109" style="s2">we&#39;ve now become familiar with you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.990" end="00:51:12.460" style="s2">been accused of with of course no</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.109" end="00:51:14.339" style="s2">evidence because there can be no</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.460" end="00:51:19.270" style="s2">evidence for something that isn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.339" end="00:51:23.020" style="s2">yeah and you know the the hard part to</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.270" end="00:51:25.240" style="s2">understand is that this energy existed</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.020" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">on the campus and you know not unique to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.240" end="00:51:32.140" style="s2">Evergreen but it was catalyzed the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.960" end="00:51:36.099" style="s2">nucleating event was the hiring of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.140" end="00:51:37.750" style="s2">George bridges who you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.099" end="00:51:40.510" style="s2">debate amongst those of us who followed</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.750" end="00:51:45.730" style="s2">the story closely about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.510" end="00:51:49.329" style="s2">he is a diabolical or</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.730" end="00:51:51.730" style="s2">just inept and really the answer is well</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.329" end="00:51:55.299" style="s2">he&#39;s clearly inept but that&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.730" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">know you can be both and what he did was</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.299" end="00:52:01.930" style="s2">he partnered with this madness in order</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:05.410" style="s2">to advance his own agenda and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.930" end="00:52:09.069" style="s2">it unleashed this on the campus which I</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.410" end="00:52:11.230" style="s2">don&#39;t think he expected but less Purse</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.069" end="00:52:13.270" style="s2">the previous president had been holding</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.230" end="00:52:17.289" style="s2">it at bay and frankly less purse because</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.270" end="00:52:19.210" style="s2">he happened to be a black man could more</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.289" end="00:52:21.250" style="s2">easily dismiss out of hand without</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.210" end="00:52:23.559" style="s2">giving any time to these people at all</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.250" end="00:52:25.569" style="s2">any such complaints that came his way I</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.559" end="00:52:27.910" style="s2">presume he was doing it you know we</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.569" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">basically never saw it until he stepped</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.910" end="00:52:35.230" style="s2">down and we got bridges well we did see</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:38.619" style="s2">it and it&#39;s one of theirs is of idiot no</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.230" end="00:52:41.349" style="s2">not not during his tour yes but famously</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.619" end="00:52:44.200" style="s2">as one of the main buildings on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.349" end="00:52:46.570" style="s2">campus was remodeled and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.200" end="00:52:49.390" style="s2">named in his honor he came back from</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.570" end="00:52:51.070" style="s2">retirement for the dedication and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.390" end="00:52:54.550" style="s2">very same people who show up again and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.070" end="00:52:55.390" style="s2">again and again in the protests of of</p>

<p begin="00:52:55.390" end="00:53:01.180" style="s2">they still activists a student activists</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:03.369" style="s2">those same students confronted him and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.180" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">this is the place where they reveal you</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.460" style="s2">know he reasons with them and he says</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.700" end="00:53:11.770" style="s2">look I&#39;m not deaf to your concerns but</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.460" end="00:53:14.829" style="s2">there&#39;s a right way and there&#39;s a right</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.770" end="00:53:17.680" style="s2">objective and what you all are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.829" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">dangerous to this and you know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.680" end="00:53:20.970" style="s2">shut him down</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">and he invokes Martin Luther King and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.970" end="00:53:26.410" style="s2">one of the protesters says yes but dr.</p>

<p begin="00:54:09.030" end="00:54:13.060" style="s2">there are there are many types of</p>

<p begin="00:54:29.950" end="00:54:33.849" style="s2">happened because the video that went</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.990" end="00:54:35.710" style="s2">viral that the students themselves took</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.589" end="00:55:06.339" style="s2">think one of them clearly is yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.210" end="00:55:07.720" style="s2">this actually goes to a discussion I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.339" end="00:55:09.789" style="s2">been having on a number of fronts with a</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.720" end="00:55:13.329" style="s2">number of different people where I hear</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.789" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">people give advice and the advice is of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.329" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">this nature you will be better if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:28.270" style="s2">imagine that everyone is acting in good</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:31.329" style="s2">faith and my feeling about this is when</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.270" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">people even if somebody is advocating</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.329" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">something terrible very often</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:37.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:38.619" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and assuming that they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.000" end="00:55:40.180" style="s2">acting in good faith relative to what</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.619" end="00:55:43.270" style="s2">they internally believe actually works</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.180" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s helpful but if you just make this a</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:53.319" style="s2">to make yourself vulnerable to every</p>

<p begin="00:55:56.049" end="00:56:01.630" style="s2">small numbers but they do prey on those</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.750" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">who use a heuristic like that and make</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.630" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">themselves incapable of fending off an</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:11.500" style="s2">attack and so I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:15.190" style="s2">that I believe happened is that a place</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.500" end="00:56:18.849" style="s2">like evergreen accumulates people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.190" end="00:56:20.980" style="s2">are basically cowards I mean academia in</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.849" end="00:56:24.640" style="s2">general seems to but evergreen may be</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.980" end="00:56:27.940" style="s2">even worse and an assumption like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.640" end="00:56:31.420" style="s2">is basically a neon sign advertising for</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.940" end="00:56:34.869" style="s2">people who are really just in it for</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.420" end="00:56:39.660" style="s2">themselves and you know I I saw</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.869" end="00:56:41.500" style="s2">something I&#39;m Benjamin Boyce put up a an</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.660" end="00:56:43.059" style="s2">interview that he had done with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.500" end="00:56:46.869" style="s2">student of mine who was a student at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.059" end="00:56:48.670" style="s2">time the protests broke out actually is</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.869" end="00:56:52.680" style="s2">that could you put up the video of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.670" end="00:56:52.680" style="s2">George talking and then put up the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.630" end="00:56:59.950" style="s2">alright we will see if this works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.450" end="00:57:03.250" style="s2">not working that&#39;s unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.950" end="00:57:05.619" style="s2">so in any case this is a student of mine</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.250" end="00:57:08.099" style="s2">who says that she had worked as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.619" end="00:57:10.529" style="s2">waitress at a restaurant near</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.099" end="00:57:11.999" style="s2">near the college and that George would</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.529" end="00:57:14.849" style="s2">come in frequently and she would end up</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.999" end="00:57:20.549" style="s2">serving him and she describes that there</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.849" end="00:57:22.589" style="s2">is a moment at which he realizes that he</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.549" end="00:57:24.569" style="s2">has met her before and that she is an</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.589" end="00:57:26.939" style="s2">evergreen student and she describes that</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.569" end="00:57:29.609" style="s2">he puts on this smile and he asks her</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.939" end="00:57:32.029" style="s2">how her studies are going and he</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.609" end="00:57:35.400" style="s2">inquires about whether or not she is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.029" end="00:57:40.680" style="s2">liking evergreen and her comment is I</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.400" end="00:57:44.489" style="s2">just had the sense that he that that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.680" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">the moment at which he decided to care</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.489" end="00:57:48.509" style="s2">to seem like he gave a damn this reminds</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:53.219" style="s2">me of so mean of our former colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.509" end="00:57:56.729" style="s2">the probably are going someplace else</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.219" end="00:57:59.009" style="s2">with this but I was marveling reading</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.729" end="00:58:01.589" style="s2">through some of the past emails at the</p>

<p begin="00:59:06.660" end="00:59:14.300" style="s2">that&#39;s unfortunate so I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.039" end="00:59:16.830" style="s2">about this this believe all students</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.300" end="00:59:18.570" style="s2">logic that was showing up a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.830" end="00:59:22.710" style="s2">conversations and emails in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.570" end="00:59:24.810" style="s2">2016-2017 academic year and I will say</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.710" end="00:59:27.180" style="s2">that I tended to see this from exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.810" end="00:59:28.680" style="s2">the people who will talk about and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.180" end="00:59:31.740" style="s2">need to be student-centered and we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.680" end="00:59:34.290" style="s2">to be student focused and almost always</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.740" end="00:59:35.910" style="s2">when I knew anything about these faculty</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.290" end="00:59:39.000" style="s2">and for in some cases I had talked with</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.910" end="00:59:40.950" style="s2">some of them I know that as soon as the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.000" end="00:59:43.290" style="s2">doors were closed and there wasn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.950" end="00:59:45.540" style="s2">possibility that students were listening</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.290" end="00:59:48.750" style="s2">and these are exactly the faculty who</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.540" end="00:59:50.460" style="s2">were dehumanizing students refusing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.750" end="00:59:52.620" style="s2">learn their names much less anything</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.460" end="00:59:54.150" style="s2">about them and you know this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.620" end="00:59:58.320" style="s2">one of the things that was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.150" end="01:00:00.750" style="s2">possible and necessary to use Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.320" end="01:00:02.370" style="s2">in the maximally best way possible which</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.750" end="01:00:04.470" style="s2">was to take the opportunity of having a</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.370" end="01:00:06.540" style="s2">full-time program for 10 weeks or 20</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.470" end="01:00:07.830" style="s2">weeks or 30 weeks and not just learn</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.540" end="01:00:10.590" style="s2">everyone&#39;s names for that a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.830" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">days obviously but learn something about</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.590" end="01:00:15.990" style="s2">them so that you actually had an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:19.020" style="s2">sense of who they were as people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.990" end="01:00:22.350" style="s2">not brains in jars and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.020" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">developed this rubric late in the game</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.350" end="01:00:25.650" style="s2">at Evergreen at the point that I had</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:28.710" style="s2">grown quite tired of most of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.650" end="01:00:30.300" style="s2">colleagues precisely because of this and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.710" end="01:00:32.490" style="s2">said cut there should be just a you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.300" end="01:00:35.220" style="s2">I have a low bar for what it should take</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.490" end="01:00:37.500" style="s2">to be a successful faculty at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.220" end="01:00:39.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.500" end="01:00:41.100" style="s2">you should actually believe in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.480" end="01:00:42.810" style="s2">fundamental humanity of your students</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.100" end="01:00:44.430" style="s2">and you should have something real that</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.810" end="01:00:48.330" style="s2">you know that you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.430" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">communicating and so many faculty failed</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.330" end="01:00:52.110" style="s2">one or both of those one of both of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:55.110" style="s2">those rubrics and this thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.110" end="01:00:56.820" style="s2">say about your student who was waiting</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.110" end="01:00:59.370" style="s2">tables at a place where George bridges</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.820" end="01:01:01.590" style="s2">came in that she saw the mass go up yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.370" end="01:01:03.900" style="s2">which means the mass sometimes comes</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.590" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">down and this is certainly the sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.900" end="01:01:10.260" style="s2">that we had of him throughout it was not</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">who he appeared that you know hapless so</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.260" end="01:01:16.650" style="s2">total genius who knows but you know some</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:18.960" style="s2">kind of combination of the two and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.650" end="01:01:21.210" style="s2">certainly the evil genius trope would</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.960" end="01:01:25.350" style="s2">use hapless as a thing to hide behind</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.210" end="01:01:27.130" style="s2">yeah the irony of course though is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.350" end="01:01:29.800" style="s2">many of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.130" end="01:01:34.510" style="s2">leading the charge would tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.800" end="01:01:37.780" style="s2">the enemy was old white men and from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.510" end="01:01:39.940" style="s2">outside it really looks to me like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.780" end="01:01:41.620" style="s2">college they&#39;ve now announced the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.940" end="01:01:43.720" style="s2">Georgia will retire at the end of his</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.620" end="01:01:46.240" style="s2">contract they&#39;re going to give him the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.720" end="01:01:49.720" style="s2">right to teach at the college after he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.240" end="01:01:53.490" style="s2">retired which is very unusual the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.720" end="01:01:57.040" style="s2">college is now selling a false story</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.490" end="01:01:59.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s you know the the pandemic that</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.040" end="01:02:01.150" style="s2">has caused the failure and they were</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.680" end="01:02:03.490" style="s2">before that they were selling the false</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.150" end="01:02:07.090" style="s2">story that the decline in enrollment was</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.490" end="01:02:09.010" style="s2">going before bridges arrived and of</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.090" end="01:02:10.840" style="s2">course it&#39;s not that there wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.010" end="01:02:12.690" style="s2">enrollment issue but it&#39;s quite obvious</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.840" end="01:02:15.340" style="s2">from the graph that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.690" end="01:02:18.250" style="s2">precipitous catastrophe surrounding</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.340" end="01:02:23.500" style="s2">George and you know his plan for the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.250" end="01:02:26.380" style="s2">place and somehow as he&#39;s brought the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.500" end="01:02:28.720" style="s2">place to its knees and they can&#39;t bear</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.380" end="01:02:30.430" style="s2">to have a conversation with him in which</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.720" end="01:02:32.860" style="s2">they say actually George you&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.430" end="01:02:35.020" style="s2">rotten job you know don&#39;t let the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.860" end="01:02:36.370" style="s2">doorknob hit you on the way out no</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.020" end="01:02:38.080" style="s2">they&#39;re still talking about him having</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.370" end="01:02:40.600" style="s2">used wisdom throughout difficult times</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.080" end="01:02:43.900" style="s2">it&#39;s depressing they&#39;re praising the man</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.600" end="01:02:45.790" style="s2">and so they they&#39;ve liquidated a college</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.900" end="01:02:48.670" style="s2">and what did that college do that</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.790" end="01:02:51.070" style="s2">college served underserved people who</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.670" end="01:02:53.650" style="s2">did they liquidate it for so is not to</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.070" end="01:02:55.510" style="s2">embarrass Georgia bridges what kind of</p>

<p begin="01:02:55.510" end="01:03:00.040" style="s2">now how did they not notice that they</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.210" end="01:03:02.320" style="s2">were in some sense doing exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.040" end="01:03:07.770" style="s2">thing that they declared the world was</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.320" end="01:03:12.610" style="s2">guilty of that&#39;s right all right</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.770" end="01:03:14.170" style="s2">it&#39;s an hour-ish it&#39;s an hour-ish you</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.610" end="01:03:15.700" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s a ton more that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.170" end="01:03:18.820" style="s2">can talk about of course we were</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.700" end="01:03:21.070" style="s2">planning to take a break at some point</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.820" end="01:03:24.460" style="s2">and take super check questions but only</p>

<p begin="01:03:30.280" end="01:03:34.390" style="s2">that we end up talking about for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.930" end="01:03:38.140" style="s2">entire time or we may go through many of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.390" end="01:03:41.290" style="s2">them I&#39;m I feel like there&#39;s so much</p>

<p begin="01:03:46.090" end="01:03:53.140" style="s2">little bit about the expected places</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:58.030" style="s2">where we found support mostly in</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.140" end="01:04:01.960" style="s2">students and a little bit also about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.030" end="01:04:04.150" style="s2">unexpected including from Alain Nasser</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.960" end="01:04:08.080" style="s2">and let me just say one more of those</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.150" end="01:04:11.230" style="s2">and then mention some previously unknown</p>
