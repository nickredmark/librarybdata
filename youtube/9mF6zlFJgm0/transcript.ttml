<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:17.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:17.690" style="s2">experience of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:32.519" style="s2">reading a transcript actually of one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.210" end="00:00:35.129" style="s2">the the dialogues I did with them with</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.519" end="00:00:40.230" style="s2">John Becky and Jordan Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.129" end="00:00:43.019" style="s2">Christopher and we&#39;re all working on</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:44.839" style="s2">this anthology together this you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.019" end="00:00:49.309" style="s2">contributing a section to this and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.839" end="00:00:53.609" style="s2">basically about dialogue dialogue OHS</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.309" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">and in the chapter that Chris and John</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.609" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">are writing part of the part of it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">was you know laying out the transcript</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">of one of the dialogues and and I read</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">it and Chris read it and Chris mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">something that was really striking</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:14.429" style="s2">because it was really my experience too</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:21.679" style="s2">which was in reading them in reading the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.429" end="00:01:24.920" style="s2">text it was so clear how world forming</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.679" end="00:01:26.840" style="s2">the conversation was</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.920" end="00:01:29.479" style="s2">like there really was a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.840" end="00:01:33.320" style="s2">reading it you can really kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.479" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">this world start formed and in some way</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.320" end="00:01:41.960" style="s2">the world it became so obvious that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:51.590" style="s2">world were the ones who were coming to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.960" end="00:01:54.950" style="s2">character as the inter lockers in a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.590" end="00:01:57.950" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t as a parent when we were in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.950" end="00:01:59.630" style="s2">the dialogue and it&#39;s not what I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.950" end="00:02:00.289" style="s2">saying is it wasn&#39;t like being in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.630" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.289" end="00:02:05.350" style="s2">I mean clearly there was a world being</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:10.220" style="s2">through that conversation was world ik</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.350" end="00:02:12.590" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t foreground in fact I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.220" end="00:02:17.060" style="s2">it&#39;s also kind of seems obvious you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.590" end="00:02:20.450" style="s2">reading it is that you know because this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:26.170" style="s2">is what a world does right it it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.450" end="00:02:29.329" style="s2">the background or the horizon that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.170" end="00:02:33.739" style="s2">allows the particulars of that world to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.329" end="00:02:37.100" style="s2">gather right and in its withdrawal the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.739" end="00:02:42.440" style="s2">world as such the particular world of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.100" end="00:02:44.630" style="s2">the fruit fly or the sidewalk or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.440" end="00:02:48.500" style="s2">person walking down the sidewalk that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.630" end="00:02:51.290" style="s2">gets to come into appearance until in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.500" end="00:02:57.170" style="s2">some sense right the the world form a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.290" end="00:02:59.290" style="s2">formation of the conversation was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.170" end="00:03:06.519" style="s2">world of the degree that did withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.290" end="00:03:12.350" style="s2">however in what was foreground for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.519" end="00:03:14.120" style="s2">were the particular people right the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.350" end="00:03:19.480" style="s2">faces of the other and what they said</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.120" end="00:03:19.480" style="s2">and being one of the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.410" end="00:03:24.680" style="s2">and there really is this this awareness</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.819" end="00:03:26.450" style="s2">and this is part of what makes it dialo</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.680" end="00:03:28.970" style="s2">gose is that on some level there is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.450" end="00:03:31.250" style="s2">sense in which you hear yourself putting</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.970" end="00:03:33.560" style="s2">together thoughts in such a way insane</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.250" end="00:03:39.830" style="s2">things spontaneously that are so above</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.560" end="00:03:44.140" style="s2">your normal pay grade right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.830" end="00:03:44.140" style="s2">the fascinating part of it right</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.300" end="00:03:52.700" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.550" end="00:03:56.890" style="s2">and I think what well what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.700" end="00:04:00.740" style="s2">about being one of the inner lockers is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.890" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">that where I do think the background or</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.740" end="00:04:08.290" style="s2">the world bled into the foreground I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:15.160" style="s2">think is as is in the experience of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.290" end="00:04:17.720" style="s2">profound affinity felt with each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.160" end="00:04:22.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain kind of sparkling</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.720" end="00:04:24.310" style="s2">glistening sense of kind of I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.340" end="00:04:29.770" style="s2">what what to call it just other than a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.310" end="00:04:35.420" style="s2">stunning almost transpersonal affinity</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:04:38.810" style="s2">for the other it&#39;s clearly quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.420" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">ecstatic and I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.810" end="00:04:43.730" style="s2">those those moments of affinity are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:48.350" style="s2">way that the world breaks through right</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.730" end="00:04:50.090" style="s2">becomes it bleeds through the figure and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.350" end="00:04:53.180" style="s2">one could say that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:55.640" style="s2">conversation was this kind of background</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.180" end="00:04:59.140" style="s2">foreground background foreground right</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.640" end="00:04:59.140" style="s2">world forming</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:12.990" style="s2">you know I suppose what we can say I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.570" end="00:05:16.290" style="s2">noticed seeing that that one will one</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.990" end="00:05:23.820" style="s2">begins to wonder the particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.290" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">character one is in your life kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.820" end="00:05:31.860" style="s2">seems it seems like you&#39;re the person</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">I&#39;m the one walking of the one talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.860" end="00:05:44.639" style="s2">I&#39;m in the world but I wonder I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">if it isn&#39;t also the case that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.639" end="00:05:55.050" style="s2">characters that we become are as such as</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:57.389" style="s2">being a part of a conversation that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.050" end="00:06:01.400" style="s2">itself is world forming and that world</p>
