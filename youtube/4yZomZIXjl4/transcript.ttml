<p begin="00:00:51.470" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">know beginning of the 20th century maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.970" end="00:00:57.530" style="s2">in the 19th century somewhere around</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:00:59.630" style="s2">there but okay so we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.530" end="00:01:04.519" style="s2">the power dynamics between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.630" end="00:01:07.640" style="s2">correct okay so so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.519" end="00:01:09.409" style="s2">presentation I&#39;ve thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.640" end="00:01:13.730" style="s2">for a long time I there was a I had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.409" end="00:01:16.010" style="s2">philosophy professor who said that back</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.730" end="00:01:18.290" style="s2">in the Middle Ages women were in control</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.010" end="00:01:20.840" style="s2">of family men were in control of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.290" end="00:01:22.670" style="s2">state and this got me thinking for years</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.840" end="00:01:24.890" style="s2">and years also think about this and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.670" end="00:01:28.670" style="s2">never heard a voice she&#39;s podcaster and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.890" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">she said it in a she said something very</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.670" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">simple she said that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:36.470" style="s2">working in the fields in late in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:39.400" style="s2">Middle Ages basically did equal work</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.470" end="00:01:41.450" style="s2">they worked alongside of each other and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.400" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">let&#39;s not forget that women were often</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.450" end="00:01:46.790" style="s2">pregnant when they were working and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">in the late Middle Ages there there</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.790" end="00:01:51.710" style="s2">began to be changes in the tools that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:54.890" style="s2">were being used such as the plow for</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.710" end="00:01:59.479" style="s2">example and these were bigger tools</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.890" end="00:02:02.659" style="s2">which were not it simply wasn&#39;t a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.479" end="00:02:04.310" style="s2">idea for women to use them so men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.659" end="00:02:05.689" style="s2">interesting this on the side you said</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.310" end="00:02:12.190" style="s2">the plow and that&#39;s that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.689" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">phallic but it was big</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.190" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">took a certain type of you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:19.270" style="s2">basically easier for men to manage</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:20.440" style="s2">certain tools which and maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.270" end="00:02:21.640" style="s2">bigger they were herded a man they</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.440" end="00:02:24.300" style="s2">weren&#39;t really hard at matters but</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.640" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">they&#39;d they had different demands and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:35.530" style="s2">and this began because of this there</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">began a separation of of gender</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.530" end="00:02:41.650" style="s2">attachment just to tools and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:45.910" style="s2">most important thing to take note of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.650" end="00:02:48.340" style="s2">here is that the women I&#39;m guessing were</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.910" end="00:02:50.770" style="s2">were behind this in other words they</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.340" end="00:02:53.290" style="s2">endorsed it and the reason is the tools</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.770" end="00:02:56.290" style="s2">were more productive there was they</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.290" end="00:02:57.910" style="s2">produced more food for example so there</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.290" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2">was a good it was a reason for there to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.910" end="00:03:04.030" style="s2">be a gen during of tools because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.540" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">involved greater prosperity and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.030" end="00:03:09.340" style="s2">the late Middle Ages that you see ink a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">gret very very small increases in</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.340" end="00:03:17.020" style="s2">prosperity which gradually increased up</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:19.600" style="s2">through the through the 16th and 17th</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.020" end="00:03:22.390" style="s2">centuries and then in the in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.600" end="00:03:24.459" style="s2">century and 18th centuries in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.390" end="00:03:28.930" style="s2">century there&#39;s a significant increase</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.459" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">in prosperity and this is all related to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.930" end="00:03:33.160" style="s2">the technology now it wasn&#39;t something</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t problematic I mean the reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.160" end="00:03:37.330" style="s2">why Charles Dickens wrote about urban</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">poverty stuff is because it was creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.330" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">lots of social havoc if the world was</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:45.489" style="s2">changing it was changing quickly and but</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:48.540" style="s2">nonetheless there was an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.489" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">prosperity related to technology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.540" end="00:03:54.070" style="s2">this carried on right after the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:03:57.310" style="s2">century us parity just completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.070" end="00:04:00.040" style="s2">skyrocketed in 20th century but at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.310" end="00:04:02.770" style="s2">same time towards the end of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:06.750" style="s2">century and accelerating into the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.770" end="00:04:09.640" style="s2">century various other tools changed</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.750" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">changed the way of life for women so</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.640" end="00:04:14.920" style="s2">that there was a there was a balancing</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:17.980" style="s2">out of this I I guess what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.920" end="00:04:20.080" style="s2">imagine is that there was a an inflation</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.980" end="00:04:20.829" style="s2">of male status based on on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.080" end="00:04:24.250" style="s2">they were using</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.829" end="00:04:25.810" style="s2">more productive tools then then more and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.250" end="00:04:30.729" style="s2">more productive in the sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:33.250" style="s2">produced great more food scalable yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.729" end="00:04:36.250" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a scalable technology rather</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.250" end="00:04:39.370" style="s2">than just domestic technology right</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.250" end="00:04:41.009" style="s2">exactly and that had status because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.370" end="00:04:43.300" style="s2">meant that they there was less</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.009" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">starvation you know there was it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.300" end="00:04:49.509" style="s2">less hardship so this this involved a an</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:52.360" style="s2">inflation of male status through those</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.509" end="00:04:55.479" style="s2">centuries accelerating up into the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.360" end="00:04:58.150" style="s2">century but nonetheless being balanced</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.479" end="00:05:02.789" style="s2">out by the mention of other technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.150" end="00:05:05.110" style="s2">which enabled women to acquire a similar</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.789" end="00:05:06.699" style="s2">survey something similar about to to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.110" end="00:05:09.219" style="s2">acquire another kind of liberation if</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.699" end="00:05:12.279" style="s2">you will from from from the toils of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.219" end="00:05:14.759" style="s2">life so I mean the whole the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.279" end="00:05:17.590" style="s2">universe of domestic equipment such as</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.759" end="00:05:19.779" style="s2">you know and geez there&#39;s no end to even</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.590" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">running water for example running water</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.779" end="00:05:24.219" style="s2">is enormous you know there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.330" end="00:05:27.819" style="s2">of things that we we don&#39;t even think</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.219" end="00:05:29.860" style="s2">about you know and stuff like tampons</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.819" end="00:05:31.719" style="s2">and this stuff nobody thinks about how</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.860" end="00:05:32.919" style="s2">important they are but but awesome there</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.719" end="00:05:35.409" style="s2">are obvious things like dishwashers</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.919" end="00:05:36.430" style="s2">refrigerators and centralized heating</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.409" end="00:05:40.360" style="s2">you know you didn&#39;t have to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.430" end="00:05:44.669" style="s2">cut wood this there&#39;s no end to all do</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.360" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">to along this of domestic technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.669" end="00:05:52.180" style="s2">which bit-by-bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:53.830" style="s2">gave women a different different quality</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.180" end="00:05:56.110" style="s2">of life from what they had you know on</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.830" end="00:05:57.699" style="s2">New Year&#39;s previous this happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.110" end="00:05:59.500" style="s2">I just have a thought I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.699" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">that oh yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.500" end="00:06:04.089" style="s2">that that that leads to liberation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:05.620" style="s2">women but then I have thought that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.089" end="00:06:07.389" style="s2">know all those domestic chores actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.620" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">create community infant son in some oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.389" end="00:06:12.699" style="s2">my god some way and and and that women</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:16.979" style="s2">suddenly become isolated in the kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.699" end="00:06:19.629" style="s2">right in the 1950s America you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.979" end="00:06:23.349" style="s2">Mormons to be seems to be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.629" end="00:06:26.949" style="s2">kind of missing piece in all this this</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.349" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2">story right that prosperity and between</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.949" end="00:06:35.050" style="s2">quotes liberation</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.669" end="00:06:37.219" style="s2">is is simultaneous to alienation and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.050" end="00:06:41.500" style="s2">put incalculable</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.219" end="00:06:45.770" style="s2">loss of quality of qualitative life and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.500" end="00:06:49.460" style="s2">and even you might say socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.770" end="00:06:51.439" style="s2">catastrophe yeah so there&#39;s more people</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.460" end="00:06:53.389" style="s2">taking antidepressants and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.439" end="00:06:56.270" style="s2">thing you know and popping pills and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.389" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">whatever no just depression in general</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.270" end="00:07:01.189" style="s2">so we&#39;re taking we&#39;re taking stock of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:03.110" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re you know we no</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.189" end="00:07:06.740" style="s2">longer have slaves and we are no longer</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.460" end="00:07:19.939" style="s2">like you say there&#39;s so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:23.539" style="s2">dichotomy of amazing achievement you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.939" end="00:07:26.840" style="s2">know place next to terrible loss and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.539" end="00:07:27.949" style="s2">this is this is basically if we&#39;re to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.840" end="00:07:29.569" style="s2">understand the technological revolution</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.949" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">we really have to think about these both</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.569" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">these at once and try and very slowly</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:37.729" style="s2">sit through makes sense what it is you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:41.779" style="s2">know people who feel the loss tend to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.729" end="00:07:44.440" style="s2">condemn the technological revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.779" end="00:07:48.199" style="s2">people who feel the prosperity tend to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.440" end="00:07:51.949" style="s2">understate the loss and yeah so we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.199" end="00:07:54.589" style="s2">both the trick is to is to go through a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.949" end="00:07:56.990" style="s2">tray slowly and to and to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.589" end="00:07:58.580" style="s2">both and try and work out what the issue</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.990" end="00:08:00.289" style="s2">is I I absolutely agree the loss the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.580" end="00:08:03.500" style="s2">community is enormous and that it could</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.289" end="00:08:05.930" style="s2">be argued that the technological</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.500" end="00:08:08.719" style="s2">revolution I mean the blossom I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.930" end="00:08:11.569" style="s2">for example that community is arguably a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.719" end="00:08:15.050" style="s2">female thing it&#39;s it&#39;s arguably female</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.569" end="00:08:17.930" style="s2">dominators I said a few minutes back</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.050" end="00:08:19.669" style="s2">that family in the Middle Ages was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.930" end="00:08:22.939" style="s2">female dominant female were on a female</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.669" end="00:08:25.189" style="s2">dominant arguably the closest synonym we</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.939" end="00:08:27.620" style="s2">have to family medieval family is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.189" end="00:08:29.930" style="s2">community because what we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.620" end="00:08:32.269" style="s2">family today is nothing like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.930" end="00:08:34.760" style="s2">medieval family which was like a massive</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.269" end="00:08:36.890" style="s2">bunch of people you know all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.760" end="00:08:39.229" style="s2">blood and send me blood related you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.890" end="00:08:42.220" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at nice you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.229" end="00:08:45.050" style="s2">nuclear family has its has its</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.220" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">you know pathologies as well right oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.050" end="00:08:50.510" style="s2">yeah oh yeah that&#39;s also I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:52.250" style="s2">nuclear family is very very young it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.510" end="00:08:55.550" style="s2">almost yeah I mean that&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.250" end="00:08:56.960" style="s2">feature of didn&#39;t exist before the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.550" end="00:08:58.400" style="s2">century I believe the nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.960" end="00:09:00.620" style="s2">there was no such thing as a regular</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.400" end="00:09:02.360" style="s2">family in there well there was there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.620" end="00:09:03.560" style="s2">such a thing as monogamous families in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.360" end="00:09:05.270" style="s2">other words you had the same mother and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.560" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">father and your brother and sisters have</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.270" end="00:09:10.580" style="s2">same mother fucker that seems they go</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:12.170" style="s2">back to simply go back aways and so but</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.580" end="00:09:13.370" style="s2">nonetheless the kids were raised in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.170" end="00:09:15.170" style="s2">village with a whole bunch of other kids</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.370" end="00:09:16.550" style="s2">so they weren&#39;t raised in the house only</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.170" end="00:09:19.400" style="s2">by two parents they were raised by all</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:22.520" style="s2">kinds be ya know they&#39;re you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.400" end="00:09:25.130" style="s2">old cliche or proverb that it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.520" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">village to raise a kid to raise a child</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.130" end="00:09:29.990" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s very profound I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:33.050" style="s2">very it&#39;s very true statements and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.990" end="00:09:35.300" style="s2">think for our back children were raised</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.050" end="00:09:36.740" style="s2">by communities they were very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.300" end="00:09:38.570" style="s2">raised by when I was even when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.740" end="00:09:44.630" style="s2">kid you know there were constantly</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.570" end="00:09:46.700" style="s2">strangers yelling at me you know there</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.630" end="00:09:48.230" style="s2">was this constant and they weren&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.700" end="00:09:50.270" style="s2">doing they were only yelling at me they</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.230" end="00:09:53.780" style="s2">would be saying although it was a much</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.270" end="00:09:56.270" style="s2">more there was much more communication</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.780" end="00:09:58.700" style="s2">between all adults and children when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.270" end="00:10:00.890" style="s2">was oh yeah that&#39;s why perhaps our</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.700" end="00:10:04.760" style="s2">parents could let us go run on out on</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.890" end="00:10:06.680" style="s2">the streets for hours because because</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.760" end="00:10:08.420" style="s2">there was an understanding perhaps that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.680" end="00:10:12.940" style="s2">there would be some feedback from you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.420" end="00:10:15.080" style="s2">know the neighbors or so I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.940" end="00:10:18.350" style="s2">community in many ways is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.080" end="00:10:19.550" style="s2">the whole the way that women roll you</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.350" end="00:10:23.320" style="s2">know they seem to be much more people</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.550" end="00:10:27.530" style="s2">oriented man they&#39;re the whole the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.320" end="00:10:29.420" style="s2">gossip culture is is on a positive level</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.530" end="00:10:31.220" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really making of community</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.420" end="00:10:32.570" style="s2">it&#39;s you know that everybody they know</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.220" end="00:10:34.730" style="s2">about people they don&#39;t want people in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.570" end="00:10:36.950" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this network of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.730" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2">knowing about each other or women</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.950" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">knowing about these these hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.500" end="00:10:44.330" style="s2">donor to people right and and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:46.070" style="s2">the kind of it&#39;s the making of community</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.330" end="00:10:50.600" style="s2">and it does seem to me that that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.070" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">been I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.600" end="00:10:57.400" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of obvious that it&#39;s been it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:58.570" style="s2">been disintegrating and very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.400" end="00:11:02.060" style="s2">zoats</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.570" end="00:11:03.230" style="s2">perhaps perhaps we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.060" end="00:11:04.700" style="s2">reached the bottom and it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.230" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">get any worse because I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.700" end="00:11:10.550" style="s2">it can get any more so maybe people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:11.840" style="s2">gonna you know start getting out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.550" end="00:11:16.340" style="s2">houses again and talking to neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.840" end="00:11:18.080" style="s2">and stuff who knows well you live in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.340" end="00:11:19.520" style="s2">Newfoundland and you would think a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.080" end="00:11:22.280" style="s2">newfoundland would be more community</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.520" end="00:11:24.950" style="s2">oriented there&#39;s definitely I mean where</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.280" end="00:11:29.630" style="s2">I am like embarrassment I&#39;m an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.950" end="00:11:34.460" style="s2">example I stare I stare away from this</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.630" end="00:11:36.740" style="s2">is a social town so was going to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.460" end="00:11:38.300" style="s2">yeah I think that the lossy community is</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.740" end="00:11:43.400" style="s2">very much related to the technological</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.300" end="00:11:45.050" style="s2">revolution and so that arguably so</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.400" end="00:11:47.810" style="s2">arguably the technology is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.050" end="00:11:52.340" style="s2">male-dominated phenomenon and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.810" end="00:11:55.970" style="s2">been recently reversing you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.340" end="00:11:58.760" style="s2">arguably tools are male in a sense okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.970" end="00:12:01.610" style="s2">so I was reading something this morning</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.760" end="00:12:04.040" style="s2">on Twitter by a guy named Alexander bard</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.610" end="00:12:08.540" style="s2">and it was a quote and he said something</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.040" end="00:12:11.060" style="s2">like okay so you want that to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.540" end="00:12:12.200" style="s2">the the patriarchy and he said two world</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.060" end="00:12:15.380" style="s2">wars okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.200" end="00:12:17.750" style="s2">seventy million soldiers all men you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.380" end="00:12:20.110" style="s2">know killed destroyed right it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.750" end="00:12:21.980" style="s2">been destroyed the patriarchy right</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.110" end="00:12:23.690" style="s2">anyway I thought that was an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.980" end="00:12:25.670" style="s2">statement I wanted to bring it up</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.690" end="00:12:29.810" style="s2">because you&#39;re talking about male tools</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.670" end="00:12:32.840" style="s2">and obviously obviously war is is you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.810" end="00:12:36.470" style="s2">know has been dominated by men and male</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.840" end="00:12:38.360" style="s2">tools you&#39;re bringing you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.470" end="00:12:44.420" style="s2">introduced I think another subject right</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.360" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">now which is the subject of maleness and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.420" end="00:12:50.180" style="s2">sought and its relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:51.500" style="s2">sovereignty it seems to me that probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.180" end="00:12:53.900" style="s2">the greatest impetus for the development</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.500" end="00:12:55.730" style="s2">of technology was sovereignty in other</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.900" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">words protecting your lands from from</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.730" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">invasion</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:03.660" style="s2">and from from the enemy from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:07.949" style="s2">and it does also seem to bear Leo be</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.660" end="00:13:11.249" style="s2">estat the war is something which seems</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.949" end="00:13:14.089" style="s2">to be very quickly moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.249" end="00:13:17.189" style="s2">something like redundancy in other words</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.089" end="00:13:19.949" style="s2">you know and when nuclear arms</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.189" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">especially it makes this obvious but</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.949" end="00:13:26.069" style="s2">also conventional arms or have become so</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:28.829" style="s2">deadly so effective that people people</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.069" end="00:13:30.779" style="s2">are not very inclined to go to war no I</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.829" end="00:13:32.999" style="s2">you know there&#39;s still Wars happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.779" end="00:13:34.620" style="s2">but way less than you used to be and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.999" end="00:13:36.529" style="s2">it takes really it seems to me is for</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.620" end="00:13:38.939" style="s2">the for the whole world to be armed with</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.529" end="00:13:40.949" style="s2">drones and it seems to me that&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.939" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">matter of time before most that most the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.949" end="00:13:45.779" style="s2">world&#39;s countries have have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:47.850" style="s2">effective you know drones and then we</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.779" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">the war is going to be taken over by</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.850" end="00:13:50.339" style="s2">robots basically yeah something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:52.620" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.339" end="00:13:55.529" style="s2">and it&#39;ll also make war we don&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.620" end="00:13:57.540" style="s2">other words the the necessity to prepare</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.529" end="00:14:00.660" style="s2">for war which was essentially mail thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.540" end="00:14:04.110" style="s2">seems to be redundant it&#39;s we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.660" end="00:14:05.759" style="s2">there anyway and that that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.110" end="00:14:07.439" style="s2">alienating thing for men because they</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.759" end="00:14:09.660" style="s2">had such an important role which was to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.439" end="00:14:13.529" style="s2">protect the communities of their</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.530" end="00:15:49.810" style="s2">ways to get males to develop and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.330" end="00:15:52.860" style="s2">become men and to become you know and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.810" end="00:15:55.030" style="s2">pursue and find a purpose in life and to</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.730" end="00:16:05.080" style="s2">little bit much I think you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.400" end="00:16:08.680" style="s2">a it&#39;s a necessity for this to happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.080" end="00:16:11.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s my take on that but it may be</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.680" end="00:16:13.180" style="s2">the case that were we&#39;re swinging it</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.770" end="00:16:17.830" style="s2">seems to me we&#39;re in a female-dominated</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.180" end="00:16:22.570" style="s2">age anyway that may not be a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.830" end="00:16:24.430" style="s2">provided that men are not for one</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.570" end="00:16:27.100" style="s2">heinous which is one of my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.430" end="00:16:28.450" style="s2">issues with feminism and two that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.100" end="00:16:31.060" style="s2">they&#39;re not that they&#39;re that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.450" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">developing in their developing property</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.060" end="00:16:34.900" style="s2">and becoming men and what doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:37.000" style="s2">so what does it mean to develop</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.900" end="00:16:39.940" style="s2">masculinity in the in the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.000" end="00:16:41.770" style="s2">as opposed to what it was in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.940" end="00:16:43.990" style="s2">century or they&#39;re you know or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.770" end="00:16:47.470" style="s2">Middle Ages are well that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.990" end="00:16:52.930" style="s2">question so what does masculinity mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.470" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">today like I have a sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.930" end="00:16:57.520" style="s2">equally important you know I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:16:59.260" style="s2">a truism to femininity let the two are</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.520" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">complementary and would you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.260" end="00:17:03.130" style="s2">fully developed to the hilt right right</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:06.280" style="s2">it&#39;s true less strong men and strong</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.130" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">women not us not domineering women and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.280" end="00:17:14.770" style="s2">and pathetic man or or or you know or</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:21.140" style="s2">you know alpha men and and and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.770" end="00:17:24.500" style="s2">you know I defined for myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.140" end="00:17:27.860" style="s2">what I call the gentleman the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.500" end="00:17:29.809" style="s2">evolution of men is it I mean I learned</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.860" end="00:17:32.179" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought a lot about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.809" end="00:17:33.920" style="s2">past year and it was related to you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.179" end="00:17:35.450" style="s2">all this learning about psychometrics</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.920" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">through people like Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.450" end="00:17:40.250" style="s2">tremendous drug preachers and others as</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:46.370" style="s2">well that Karen strong and prepped month</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.250" end="00:17:48.860" style="s2">on and a few others the my definition of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.370" end="00:17:52.600" style="s2">the gentleman which is what we should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.860" end="00:17:58.630" style="s2">working on it has five points</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.600" end="00:17:58.630" style="s2">responsibilities in culture confidence</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.750" end="00:18:04.790" style="s2">integrity and there&#39;s always a fifth I</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.929" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">always forget the fifth responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.790" end="00:18:10.100" style="s2">competence culture in other words you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">you know if you don&#39;t know if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.100" end="00:18:12.860" style="s2">know your literature you got at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:14.540" style="s2">know your hockey scores there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.860" end="00:18:17.059" style="s2">there&#39;s culture for every level of male</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.540" end="00:18:18.919" style="s2">yeah and so he needs he needs to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.059" end="00:18:20.870" style="s2">he&#39;s gotta have culture gone so</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.919" end="00:18:26.210" style="s2">competence culture integrity</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.870" end="00:18:27.110" style="s2">responsibility and so something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.210" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.110" end="00:18:32.950" style="s2">points points us in a direction to for</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.620" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">men to look at what they need to do to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.950" end="00:18:39.530" style="s2">you know they have to fulfill these</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:43.160" style="s2">criteria you know what do men do in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.530" end="00:18:45.049" style="s2">face of the female principle is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.160" end="00:18:48.770" style="s2">kind of beginning question of mine in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.049" end="00:18:51.830" style="s2">mind so the complete you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.770" end="00:18:52.940" style="s2">complete individual integrates both the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.830" end="00:18:55.970" style="s2">me meant the for male and female</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.940" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">principals into him or her mmm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.970" end="00:18:59.870" style="s2">so if you&#39;re a man then you you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">integrate the female principle into you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.870" end="00:19:05.570" style="s2">and the same thing for women and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:09.740" style="s2">it&#39;s arguably the individual is someone</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.570" end="00:19:13.640" style="s2">who who transcends the well you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.740" end="00:19:17.960" style="s2">integrate but but not be dominated by it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.640" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2">like that&#39;s animus the anima is is when</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.960" end="00:19:21.799" style="s2">you&#39;re dominated with when a male is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:24.260" style="s2">dominated by the female the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.799" end="00:19:26.059" style="s2">female spirit and the Animus is when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.260" end="00:19:28.520" style="s2">know you know there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.059" end="00:19:29.900" style="s2">hyper masculinity that develops in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.520" end="00:19:32.030" style="s2">woman you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.900" end="00:19:34.790" style="s2">we put that on there but we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.030" end="00:19:37.370" style="s2">about this already but but it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.790" end="00:19:39.470" style="s2">that a woman has to develop assertive</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.370" end="00:19:41.390" style="s2">male qualities to survive in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.470" end="00:19:43.910" style="s2">and that&#39;s obvious that a man has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.390" end="00:19:46.220" style="s2">develop you know certain certain caring</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.910" end="00:19:51.110" style="s2">you know classically female qualities I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.220" end="00:19:53.270" style="s2">think there&#39;s also something you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.110" end="00:19:56.150" style="s2">up prior to modernity sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.270" end="00:19:58.250" style="s2">community dyad okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.150" end="00:19:59.270" style="s2">now maybe you want that was the second</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.250" end="00:20:00.860" style="s2">one and you&#39;ve already talked a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.270" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">bit about sovereignty and community so</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.860" end="00:20:05.030" style="s2">maybe maybe you want to go over that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.620" style="s2">little bit okay yeah that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.030" end="00:20:08.990" style="s2">what I said men were in charge of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.620" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">state women in charge of community</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.990" end="00:20:12.920" style="s2">there&#39;s one big feminist argument is</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.809" style="s2">that they weren&#39;t allowed to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.920" end="00:20:23.480" style="s2">property I think that I think a closer</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.809" end="00:20:26.330" style="s2">analysis of that shows that property was</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.480" end="00:20:29.480" style="s2">a something very much tied to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.330" end="00:20:31.400" style="s2">sovereignty you know and so sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.480" end="00:20:33.800" style="s2">first of all the Kings at the top but</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.400" end="00:20:35.390" style="s2">really everything is sovereignty is</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.800" end="00:20:38.809" style="s2">compartmentalize right down to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.390" end="00:20:40.250" style="s2">bottom and this is part of the basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.809" end="00:20:42.790" style="s2">the protection of the security of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.250" end="00:20:47.570" style="s2">place it allows it to be managed the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.790" end="00:20:52.340" style="s2">land and it keeps it strong against as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.570" end="00:20:54.860" style="s2">as a bulwark against the enemy the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.340" end="00:20:58.160" style="s2">on the outside and this allows for</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.860" end="00:21:00.890" style="s2">community inside it to thrive and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.160" end="00:21:04.010" style="s2">this is a this is a dyad what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.890" end="00:21:07.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a yin-yang dynamic and so so to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.010" end="00:21:09.890" style="s2">be primarily concerned with security to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.400" end="00:21:12.980" style="s2">end the end and that is primarily a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.890" end="00:21:17.990" style="s2">concern of order which permeates the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.980" end="00:21:20.059" style="s2">entire territory and allows for all</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.990" end="00:21:23.059" style="s2">other things all other engagements other</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.059" end="00:21:26.059" style="s2">interactions too to just freely freely</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.059" end="00:21:29.660" style="s2">move about inside the context of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.059" end="00:21:31.940" style="s2">sovereignty I don&#39;t like to wear</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.660" end="00:21:33.590" style="s2">patriarchy I think that&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.940" end="00:21:37.070" style="s2">a sort of a hateful feminist word and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.590" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s born from out of out of a filial</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.270" end="00:22:46.220" style="s2">talks about how the abolition of slavery</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.330" end="00:22:49.610" style="s2">was really preceded by the development</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.220" end="00:22:51.800" style="s2">of sovereignty inside in Europe and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.610" end="00:22:54.700" style="s2">basically this is a fascinating video</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.800" end="00:22:58.820" style="s2">history I had I had no idea of this the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.700" end="00:23:00.050" style="s2">Europe is exclusively responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.820" end="00:23:02.740" style="s2">the abolition of slavery in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.050" end="00:23:05.630" style="s2">now they&#39;re still slaves but you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:07.730" style="s2">basically at one time every corner of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.630" end="00:23:09.590" style="s2">the earth had slaves everything was</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.730" end="00:23:12.050" style="s2">slavery was big was here there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.590" end="00:23:14.570" style="s2">slavery slaves and Buddhist monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.050" end="00:23:17.090" style="s2">in Tibet and for example and then the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.570" end="00:23:20.540" style="s2">Europeans what they did they they</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.090" end="00:23:23.900" style="s2">developed regional sovereignty in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.540" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">and they which allowed them to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.900" end="00:23:28.550" style="s2">out the the the tribes next door from</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:31.070" style="s2">invading them all the time and abducting</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.550" end="00:23:33.380" style="s2">people for slaves to take them as laves</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.070" end="00:23:35.630" style="s2">and then once they discovered the great</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.380" end="00:23:37.370" style="s2">virtues of no longer being enslaved and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.630" end="00:23:40.460" style="s2">they and they related this to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.370" end="00:23:43.850" style="s2">sovereignty and they their sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.460" end="00:23:46.490" style="s2">this was also simultaneous toric lee to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.850" end="00:23:49.840" style="s2">the great burgeoning of the of European</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.490" end="00:23:53.810" style="s2">imperial power and so they took this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.840" end="00:23:56.250" style="s2">recognition of benefit from you know not</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.810" end="00:23:59.190" style="s2">allowing themselves to be means late</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.250" end="00:24:00.450" style="s2">turned imposed its abolition on the rest</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.190" end="00:24:03.900" style="s2">of the world through their imperial</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.450" end="00:24:07.710" style="s2">measures and the word thomas ola says</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.900" end="00:24:08.940" style="s2">that there were no economic incentives</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.710" end="00:24:10.680" style="s2">for this it was simply a moral</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.940" end="00:24:12.990" style="s2">imperative which grew out of European</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.680" end="00:24:15.900" style="s2">imperialism which grew out of European</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.990" end="00:24:19.320" style="s2">sovereignty so sovereignty abolished</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.900" end="00:24:22.290" style="s2">slavery and sovereignty it didn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.320" end="00:24:24.270" style="s2">abolish slavery it achieved a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.290" end="00:24:28.290" style="s2">bunch of other things too so anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.270" end="00:24:30.120" style="s2">thinks that men were were I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.290" end="00:24:33.450" style="s2">all in other words this was all a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.120" end="00:24:36.330" style="s2">function of the further development of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.450" end="00:24:38.760" style="s2">the male principle and it would seem to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.330" end="00:24:40.620" style="s2">me that the notion of sovereignty and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.760" end="00:24:42.210" style="s2">will always be important someone said to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.620" end="00:24:45.240" style="s2">me the other day it was true but I do</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.210" end="00:24:47.460" style="s2">like the paradox I just a feminism isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.240" end="00:24:51.110" style="s2">it I mean all of these things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.460" end="00:24:55.110" style="s2">liberated the woman you know were</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.110" end="00:24:57.390" style="s2">firstly developed by men you know which</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.110" end="00:24:58.740" style="s2">is so men are men are actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.390" end="00:25:04.980" style="s2">interested in the liberation of women</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.740" end="00:25:08.520" style="s2">right absolutely so so so all the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.980" end="00:25:11.790" style="s2">you know all the medicine all the you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.520" end="00:25:14.070" style="s2">know politics and stuff is was so so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.790" end="00:25:16.710" style="s2">liberation of women is not just women</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.070" end="00:25:19.640" style="s2">liberating themselves from men it&#39;s men</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.710" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">and women together liberating women</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.640" end="00:25:26.460" style="s2">absolutely and the during the enduring I</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:30.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the word is hanging I</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.460" end="00:25:34.170" style="s2">suppose of feminism about them being</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.570" end="00:25:37.350" style="s2">second second-class or something is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.170" end="00:25:40.170" style="s2">me completely abominable and they they</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.350" end="00:25:43.380" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to they seem not to they seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.170" end="00:25:46.680" style="s2">to be willfully denying this process</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.380" end="00:25:48.540" style="s2">which led to why is this happening</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.680" end="00:25:50.730" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s baby hunt and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.540" end="00:25:52.620" style="s2">Beyond behind that like I I think they</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.730" end="00:25:53.970" style="s2">just like condemn it and say oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.620" end="00:25:56.550" style="s2">those bad feminists you know those</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.970" end="00:25:59.490" style="s2">extreme feminists like what why is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.550" end="00:26:01.080" style="s2">why is why is this so all pervasive you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.490" end="00:26:03.210" style="s2">know why is it so awkward why is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.080" end="00:26:05.540" style="s2">sort of I said in this Andry right</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.210" end="00:26:09.000" style="s2">because it feels like misandry it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.540" end="00:26:09.970" style="s2">why is it so all pervasive at this at</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.000" end="00:26:12.580" style="s2">this time</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.970" end="00:26:15.250" style="s2">well one I mean I thought I already</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.580" end="00:26:16.990" style="s2">discussed the the inflation of the male</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.250" end="00:26:19.420" style="s2">status turn because of technology and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.990" end="00:26:22.090" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that involved so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.420" end="00:26:24.850" style="s2">not this there was a really a separation</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.090" end="00:26:26.410" style="s2">of status but prosperity came with it so</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.850" end="00:26:28.240" style="s2">there was kind of an endorsement from</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.410" end="00:26:29.710" style="s2">women so I think there&#39;s a resentment of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:30.970" style="s2">that what a thing is not only not only</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.710" end="00:26:33.040" style="s2">covered in relatively short period of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.970" end="00:26:37.060" style="s2">history and I think in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.040" end="00:26:38.710" style="s2">correct himself well so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.060" end="00:26:40.590" style="s2">resentment over that period of history</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.710" end="00:26:43.870" style="s2">which I suppose you could argue is</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.590" end="00:26:49.630" style="s2">understandable but then I think they</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.870" end="00:26:51.040" style="s2">also feminists of also conflated the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.630" end="00:26:54.910" style="s2">notion and this is where we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.040" end="00:26:58.510" style="s2">about agency and hypo agency the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.910" end="00:27:01.150" style="s2">idea that women don&#39;t mm-hmm haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.510" end="00:27:04.120" style="s2">really had a voice in history well I</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.150" end="00:27:13.240" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s strong evidence</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.120" end="00:27:16.150" style="s2">that female hypo agency is is something</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.240" end="00:27:18.130" style="s2">that worked for them for a long time now</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.150" end="00:27:20.290" style="s2">the fact that they went hypo agency is I</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.130" end="00:27:24.190" style="s2">think I have a general idea of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.290" end="00:27:25.570" style="s2">sort of the sense that one one not only</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.190" end="00:27:27.370" style="s2">does not a voice but doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.570" end="00:27:29.770" style="s2">need to have a voice in other words</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.370" end="00:27:31.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to articulate doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.770" end="00:27:32.890" style="s2">doesn&#39;t particulate one selves and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.330" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re the power behind the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.890" end="00:27:36.490" style="s2">throne kind of thing right something</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:40.900" style="s2">like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.490" end="00:27:44.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a public voice and nor does</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.900" end="00:27:47.040" style="s2">nor does she in this case have a desire</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.680" end="00:27:50.560" style="s2">to have a public voice there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.040" end="00:27:54.280" style="s2">Thursday and a kind of a sense of which</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.560" end="00:27:56.620" style="s2">it works for you know and this it would</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.280" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">appear that this is there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.620" end="00:28:00.550" style="s2">women who want to have a public voice I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:04.660" style="s2">have absolutely no issue with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.550" end="00:28:07.990" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but it would seem to me that</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.660" end="00:28:11.410" style="s2">the women who choose to have a public</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.990" end="00:28:13.930" style="s2">voice and who pursue it will always be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.410" end="00:28:16.420" style="s2">minority they may well be an important</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.930" end="00:28:18.850" style="s2">minority but they and there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.420" end="00:28:21.070" style="s2">case that maybe feminism in recent years</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.850" end="00:28:25.270" style="s2">is a case from the important</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.070" end="00:28:26.980" style="s2">of women who wish to to have a voice</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.270" end="00:28:29.830" style="s2">which death agency we should do</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.980" end="00:28:31.960" style="s2">publication and that&#39;s fine I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.830" end="00:28:34.030" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s more than fun it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.960" end="00:28:36.100" style="s2">that anybody who wishes to have public</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.030" end="00:28:37.690" style="s2">agency should should choose with us</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.100" end="00:28:39.460" style="s2">because we&#39;re complex and there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.690" end="00:28:41.590" style="s2">kinds of different types of people with</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.460" end="00:28:45.700" style="s2">different capacities and yeah there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.580" end="00:29:19.830" style="s2">by Karen strong about this very subject</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.900" end="00:29:29.050" style="s2">psychology but basically the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.170" end="00:29:31.480" style="s2">women are not going to want to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.050" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">public agency they&#39;re perfectly happy to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.480" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">have to live more discrete lives you</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.770" end="00:29:52.870" style="s2">that&#39;s where and it&#39;s see I&#39;m winning</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.220" end="00:29:55.780" style="s2">I&#39;m perfectly willing to put my neck out</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.950" end="00:30:16.840" style="s2">what they prefer and there was there</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.550" end="00:30:22.630" style="s2">will be an important minority who won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.840" end="00:30:28.540" style="s2">be that way so and Karen explains this</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.630" end="00:30:30.610" style="s2">in evolutionary terms the the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.540" end="00:30:32.690" style="s2">discrete woman</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.610" end="00:30:35.899" style="s2">first of all she</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.690" end="00:30:38.539" style="s2">quietly she heard she did not attract a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.899" end="00:30:41.509" style="s2">lot of attention she was not given she</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.539" end="00:30:45.079" style="s2">was she was kept in a safer zone by</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.509" end="00:30:47.389" style="s2">being so and the expressive man was was</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.079" end="00:30:49.669" style="s2">you know it was evolutionary advantage</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.389" end="00:30:53.869" style="s2">from the point of view of procreation</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.669" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">that means passing on his genes to be to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.869" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">live dangerously to be out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:59.749" style="s2">to be picking his neck out in all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:01.399" style="s2">of different ways and that&#39;s what agency</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.749" end="00:31:04.699" style="s2">really is you&#39;re constantly taking</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.399" end="00:31:05.749" style="s2">chances you and your you don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.699" end="00:31:07.940" style="s2">if you if you have the public life</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.749" end="00:31:09.199" style="s2">you&#39;re always you know putting your foot</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.940" end="00:31:11.089" style="s2">in your mouth so to speak you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.199" end="00:31:13.129" style="s2">that&#39;s what public life is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.089" end="00:31:16.969" style="s2">constantly in this in this dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.129" end="00:31:19.099" style="s2">world and and not only so so the minute</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.969" end="00:31:21.139" style="s2">that is the separation between age dizzy</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.099" end="00:31:23.449" style="s2">and hypo agency the woman hangs pegs</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.139" end="00:31:25.789" style="s2">around the hearth and this will increase</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.449" end="00:31:27.949" style="s2">the probability that she will pass on</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.789" end="00:31:29.779" style="s2">the her genes she&#39;s her her importance</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.949" end="00:31:32.809" style="s2">around young children as extremely is</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.779" end="00:31:36.139" style="s2">very high she had to remain safe in</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.809" end="00:31:37.909" style="s2">order to to children to survive to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.139" end="00:31:40.339" style="s2">adulthood so as to pass on their genes</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.909" end="00:31:43.069" style="s2">and the man all he had to do was</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.339" end="00:31:45.529" style="s2">impregnate the woman and then he could</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.069" end="00:31:47.959" style="s2">be killed a few days later you know off</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.529" end="00:31:49.909" style="s2">doing some dangerous thing and so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.959" end="00:31:51.229" style="s2">was a both it was an evolution from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.909" end="00:31:52.759" style="s2">point of view of passing on your genes</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.229" end="00:31:55.699" style="s2">it was an evolutionary advantage for</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.759" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">both genders mm-hmm when I was listening</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.699" end="00:31:59.749" style="s2">to Brett Weinstein talk about that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.749" style="s2">was he was talking about that as this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.749" end="00:32:05.509" style="s2">you know this is this is a truth right</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.749" end="00:32:07.209" style="s2">about biology right but we have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.509" end="00:32:10.279" style="s2">of overcome that because biology is</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.209" end="00:32:12.739" style="s2">tyrannical my biology is terrible like</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.279" end="00:32:15.069" style="s2">it as it in the sense of how it works</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.739" end="00:32:23.709" style="s2">without let&#39;s say a human consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.069" end="00:32:26.359" style="s2">intervening aware of biological</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.709" end="00:32:28.999" style="s2">biologically determining factors in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.359" end="00:32:30.469" style="s2">human condition so most definitely I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.999" end="00:32:32.889" style="s2">most definitely believed in society I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.469" end="00:32:36.109" style="s2">absolutely believe in social construct</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.889" end="00:32:37.459" style="s2">these are these are absolutely these are</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.109" end="00:32:38.959" style="s2">clear to me I also believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.459" end="00:32:40.940" style="s2">intervention of reasoning which is all</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.959" end="00:32:42.999" style="s2">other set of that&#39;s a whole other realm</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.940" end="00:32:46.040" style="s2">of interaction you know intellect</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.999" end="00:32:54.050" style="s2">intellect so the intellectual the social</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.040" end="00:32:56.030" style="s2">biologically exist hierarchy so yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.050" end="00:32:57.560" style="s2">no no I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.030" end="00:33:00.560" style="s2">biological determinist but I am saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.560" end="00:33:05.810" style="s2">that these predispositions exist which</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.560" end="00:33:09.470" style="s2">mean that women will remain will</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.810" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">continue to seek out avenues of hi-po</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.470" end="00:33:14.990" style="s2">agency inside the social constructs that</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.990" end="00:33:19.220" style="s2">liberating they are yeah it&#39;s funny how</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.870" end="00:33:25.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between ideology</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.220" end="00:33:28.790" style="s2">and actual behavior right I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.240" end="00:33:30.950" style="s2">what am I trying to say it seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.790" end="00:33:34.430" style="s2">seems like yes we human beings are not</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.950" end="00:33:37.640" style="s2">conscious enough right generally to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.430" end="00:33:39.530" style="s2">behave you know in an enlightened manner</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.640" end="00:33:41.330" style="s2">right they&#39;re still they&#39;re still we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.530" end="00:33:44.210" style="s2">still in the darkness right we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.330" end="00:33:47.030" style="s2">we&#39;re still we&#39;re still we&#39;re so 90</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.210" end="00:33:48.980" style="s2">percent unconscious I mean most of us so</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.030" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">all of these will happen no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.980" end="00:33:55.400" style="s2">our ideological your constructs we put</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:57.770" style="s2">we put on we overlay exactly and it also</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.400" end="00:34:00.200" style="s2">may not be desirable for the mean for us</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.770" end="00:34:03.920" style="s2">to be on every sane conscious that might</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.200" end="00:34:06.020" style="s2">be that we just don&#39;t sane maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.920" end="00:34:07.490" style="s2">only designed to have this little</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.020" end="00:34:09.470" style="s2">trickle of consciousness going through</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.490" end="00:34:11.060" style="s2">reality so that we can actually learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.470" end="00:34:13.879" style="s2">things or whatever it&#39;s so so the rest</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.060" end="00:34:15.110" style="s2">of us is just on autopilot and so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.879" end="00:34:17.659" style="s2">kind of explained it&#39;s a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.110" end="00:34:21.409" style="s2">predisposition stuff right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.659" end="00:34:23.419" style="s2">know like yeah so that&#39;s that their</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.409" end="00:34:25.639" style="s2">theory lies the argument further for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.419" end="00:34:27.590" style="s2">predisposition we rely on our</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.639" end="00:34:30.530" style="s2">predisposition so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.590" end="00:34:34.340" style="s2">consciously do some tiny little thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.530" end="00:34:34.940" style="s2">right yeah so do you want me to look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.340" end="00:34:37.490" style="s2">the list again</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.940" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">oh yeah sexual violence and sexual</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.490" end="00:34:44.840" style="s2">attraction that&#39;s interesting well okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">this guy let me can I start that off</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.840" end="00:34:49.399" style="s2">okay what&#39;s the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:56.860" style="s2">ravishing in an enlightened way and like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.399" end="00:34:56.860" style="s2">let&#39;s say rape yeah you&#39;re a swell</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.790" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.349" end="00:35:08.619" style="s2">this is another evolutionary psychology</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:10.599" style="s2">argument because women are women are</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.619" end="00:35:12.220" style="s2">seem to be desperate to be safe and to</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.220" end="00:35:17.380" style="s2">like who want so many rules just to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.799" end="00:35:20.549" style="s2">sure that you know that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.380" end="00:35:23.470" style="s2">transgress this this this space right</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.549" end="00:35:25.240" style="s2">there is something in a rather system</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.470" end="00:35:29.529" style="s2">that has to be about transgression I</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.240" end="00:35:33.789" style="s2">mean on some level so so so you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.529" end="00:35:36.039" style="s2">are we moving towards a you know sexual</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.789" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2">police state or you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.039" end="00:35:47.529" style="s2">what&#39;s going on yeah that&#39;s just I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:49.990" style="s2">I was gonna say about this was about me</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.529" end="00:35:53.109" style="s2">- for example was was precisely this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.990" end="00:35:56.260" style="s2">subject of violence in sex it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.109" end="00:36:02.549" style="s2">to me that violence is inextricable from</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.260" end="00:36:04.029" style="s2">from sex and and the reason is totally</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.549" end="00:36:06.520" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.029" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">although the benefits were evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.520" end="00:36:17.319" style="s2">and that means that women who were</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:21.609" style="s2">attracted to more dangerous men violent</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:33.400" style="s2">to very to a whole variety of what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.690" end="00:37:36.650" style="s2">would bluntly call violence in men is</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.400" end="00:37:38.470" style="s2">evolution to the beast like beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.650" end="00:37:43.220" style="s2">that&#39;s again the beauty and the beauty</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.300" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">process they developed this periodic</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.740" end="00:38:40.340" style="s2">interchange and in it there&#39;s a given</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.470" style="s2">moment in that film where she realizes</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.340" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">that she&#39;s found a place in his heart</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.470" end="00:38:47.090" style="s2">and that he will never hurt her and</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.830" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">arousal bias and she knows that he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:38:58.400" style="s2">Currys the craziest darkest serial</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.400" end="00:39:03.290" style="s2">cannibal but at the same time she knows</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.290" end="00:39:08.450" style="s2">is that&#39;s like completely so it&#39;s taming</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.900" end="00:39:11.390" style="s2">the predator right it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s aiming</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.450" end="00:39:13.020" style="s2">the uber predator or the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.390" end="00:39:18.690" style="s2">most dangerous man right</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.020" end="00:39:20.820" style="s2">so this this cut this I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.690" end="00:39:24.270" style="s2">very important insight in in critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.820" end="00:39:25.650" style="s2">the me to movement because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.270" end="00:39:29.640" style="s2">performative contradiction here women</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.650" end="00:39:31.350" style="s2">are to be fair they don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.640" end="00:39:33.690" style="s2">totally unconscious why am i attracted</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.350" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">to this man why why my truck - like and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.690" end="00:39:36.510" style="s2">so they&#39;re drawn to him they&#39;re drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:38.130" style="s2">him they you know they end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.510" end="00:39:40.430" style="s2">closed doors and then you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.130" end="00:39:44.580" style="s2">they&#39;re very surprised by what happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.430" end="00:39:47.310" style="s2">and so this this these fifty shades of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.580" end="00:39:49.800" style="s2">gray inside sexuality their attraction</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.310" end="00:39:52.380" style="s2">to this and their desire to their their</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.800" end="00:39:55.380" style="s2">temptation to enter into that world so</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.380" end="00:39:58.950" style="s2">as to take to tame him so that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.380" end="00:40:00.540" style="s2">this and it&#39;s let&#39;s be fair here this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.950" end="00:40:03.390" style="s2">these are these are deeply unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.540" end="00:40:05.100" style="s2">draws this is not this is not something</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.390" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">that&#39;s she&#39;s ready it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.100" end="00:40:12.540" style="s2">that she&#39;s reasoning in her these are</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:14.369" style="s2">and see male male sexuality is not super</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.540" end="00:40:18.140" style="s2">where we&#39;re most attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.369" end="00:40:20.940" style="s2">sixteen-year-old girls and the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.140" end="00:40:22.740" style="s2">being created back in time it increases</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.940" end="00:40:24.330" style="s2">the chance that she will live long</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.740" end="00:40:26.520" style="s2">enough to raise children best live long</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.330" end="00:40:29.730" style="s2">enough to pass on her genes</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.520" end="00:40:33.420" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s you know it it would be many</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.730" end="00:40:35.100" style="s2">ways way more intelligent to to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.420" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of real arguments to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.100" end="00:40:39.510" style="s2">be attracted to it what wise are more</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:41.640" style="s2">seasoned in many ways far more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.510" end="00:40:45.780" style="s2">woman whose but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.640" end="00:40:48.450" style="s2">this this teenage this teenage blossom</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.780" end="00:40:51.540" style="s2">blossoming female which which completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.450" end="00:40:55.380" style="s2">in a totally unconscious way grabs the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.540" end="00:40:57.570" style="s2">male and that it&#39;s you know so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:40:59.790" style="s2">these are both completely irrational</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.570" end="00:41:02.250" style="s2">well maybe the point here is is is</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.790" end="00:41:06.119" style="s2">agency and and the point is agency and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.250" end="00:41:10.470" style="s2">responsibility and and blame and all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.119" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">that right yeah so so so it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.470" end="00:41:16.820" style="s2">the me to movement is entirely has</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">entirely been based on blaming you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.820" end="00:41:22.050" style="s2">pathological men and then you have a few</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:23.700" style="s2">pathological men who are really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.050" end="00:41:25.890" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously really bad and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.700" end="00:41:28.680" style="s2">you blame everybody all men you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.890" end="00:41:30.779" style="s2">all men sort of you know and most most</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.680" end="00:41:33.059" style="s2">most you know people like me and you are</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.779" end="00:41:37.499" style="s2">kind of you know ordinary guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.059" end="00:41:42.559" style="s2">on don&#39;t are somewhat offended by it by</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.499" end="00:41:45.749" style="s2">being you know put into that I say</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.559" end="00:41:49.140" style="s2">pathology of just because you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.749" end="00:41:51.539" style="s2">we have you know the male erection right</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.140" end="00:41:54.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like the lack of perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.539" end="00:41:59.039" style="s2">this this particular is this dimension</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.839" end="00:42:00.089" style="s2">of violence and sex that that the lack</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.039" end="00:42:02.309" style="s2">of perspective on that it just</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.089" end="00:42:03.630" style="s2">infuriates me and the the hypocrisy of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.309" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">it just you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.630" end="00:42:09.569" style="s2">well maybe see is it the idea that sex</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:11.910" style="s2">is dangerous right it&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.569" end="00:42:13.469" style="s2">just something you like you just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.910" end="00:42:16.739" style="s2">cook up you know and you&#39;re a little</p>

<p begin="00:42:16.739" end="00:42:20.789" style="s2">game well it also it wasn&#39;t for nothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.140" end="00:42:22.200" style="s2">that we put it in a cage on a leash a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.789" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">long time ago it&#39;s not for nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.200" end="00:42:27.719" style="s2">we have just do we have marriage you</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:30.749" style="s2">mean they have this checks and balances</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.719" end="00:42:32.729" style="s2">so as to contain sexuality so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.749" end="00:42:37.229" style="s2">it&#39;s an old story that sexuality is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.729" end="00:42:40.349" style="s2">beast and and sort of that pandora boxx</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.229" end="00:42:44.279" style="s2">isn&#39;t it it&#39;s like yeah well like this i</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.349" end="00:42:46.199" style="s2">mean learning about this female</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.420" end="00:42:57.690" style="s2">was a major revelation to me it just it</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.339" end="00:43:00.509" style="s2">was just completely it was it was it the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.690" end="00:43:03.209" style="s2">absolute eureka and actually this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.509" end="00:43:04.829" style="s2">another feature in the feminist critique</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.209" end="00:43:07.799" style="s2">where they&#39;re dead wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.829" end="00:43:09.569" style="s2">there could picture are key because or</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.799" end="00:43:12.029" style="s2">basically most attracted to a cocktail</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.569" end="00:43:13.349" style="s2">of status and the capacity not</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.029" end="00:43:15.630" style="s2">necessarily violence but the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.349" end="00:43:16.979" style="s2">for violence and then it was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.630" end="00:43:20.569" style="s2">capacity for violence</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.320" end="00:45:50.980" style="s2">sense that that they be in control of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.150" end="00:45:52.869" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.980" end="00:45:54.520" style="s2">pretty stunning thing to learn that only</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.869" end="00:45:56.980" style="s2">4% men pass on the keys</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.520" end="00:45:59.590" style="s2">but anyway what that means is that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.980" end="00:46:06.600" style="s2">had been women have been for countless</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.590" end="00:46:10.270" style="s2">millennia selecting this male trait of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.600" end="00:46:12.670" style="s2">capacity for violence and status you</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.270" end="00:46:16.390" style="s2">know greater confidence to know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.670" end="00:46:22.150" style="s2">whatever big status you know and well</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.390" end="00:46:25.180" style="s2">this basically is the this basically is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.150" end="00:46:28.920" style="s2">what has reinforced the the social</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.180" end="00:46:31.720" style="s2">structures of sovereignty among this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.920" end="00:46:35.859" style="s2">in other words female sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.720" end="00:46:38.500" style="s2">is the reinforcing factor of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.859" end="00:46:42.220" style="s2">it is you know it breeds sovereignty so</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.500" end="00:46:45.730" style="s2">to speak and so this idea that soy</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.220" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">breeds let&#39;s say can we can we unpack</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.730" end="00:46:55.060" style="s2">the sword sovereignty a bit it breeds</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:57.490" style="s2">individualistic strong-willed men or it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.060" end="00:46:58.750" style="s2">also breeds minded men who can function</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.490" end="00:47:01.990" style="s2">well the militaries and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.750" end="00:47:03.700" style="s2">stuff competence but also breeds it has</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.990" end="00:47:06.010" style="s2">it has a negative after-effects such as</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.700" end="00:47:07.180" style="s2">violence towards women and men beating</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.010" end="00:47:08.980" style="s2">down their women and telling them</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.180" end="00:47:11.740" style="s2">they&#39;re second-class citizens it has</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.980" end="00:47:14.980" style="s2">this it has this negative as well but</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.740" end="00:47:15.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s it it could despite the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.980" end="00:47:18.850" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.400" end="00:47:20.440" style="s2">it was bred into the men that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.850" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">disposition was bred into them the men</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.440" end="00:47:25.480" style="s2">by female sexual selection you see what</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:27.880" style="s2">I&#39;m saying so this and this is all</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.480" end="00:47:30.850" style="s2">ultimately unconscious so the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.880" end="00:47:32.530" style="s2">men have kept women down is not quite</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.850" end="00:47:36.340" style="s2">right because women have been choosing</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.530" end="00:47:40.030" style="s2">this type of man who will assert himself</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.340" end="00:47:41.980" style="s2">and power well it always seems like men</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.030" end="00:47:44.410" style="s2">have a certain kind of hubris about</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.980" end="00:47:46.750" style="s2">being in control but they&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.410" end="00:47:48.700" style="s2">in control like you know you see a guy</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.750" end="00:47:51.640" style="s2">and his wife and the guys always being</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.700" end="00:47:54.730" style="s2">you know he&#39;s always he&#39;s always in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.640" end="00:47:58.210" style="s2">lesser sort of you know looming roles of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.730" end="00:48:00.670" style="s2">his wife he I see that a lot I see a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.210" end="00:48:02.859" style="s2">of men are very very very much</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.670" end="00:48:03.890" style="s2">emotionally controlled by their by their</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.859" end="00:48:06.380" style="s2">wives you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.890" end="00:48:07.519" style="s2">so so they that&#39;s very that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.380" end="00:48:11.089" style="s2">you&#39;re not even allowed to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.519" end="00:48:15.259" style="s2">that because the whole emphasis is on is</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.089" end="00:48:16.759" style="s2">on men controlling women but but seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.259" end="00:48:18.920" style="s2">to be that the reverse is true that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.759" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">there is a there is a power dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.920" end="00:48:23.720" style="s2">that&#39;s working but both ways and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:25.339" style="s2">only real difference is is I guess is I</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.720" end="00:48:30.859" style="s2">guess male physical strength and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.339" end="00:48:32.480" style="s2">capacity for before for for for violence</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.859" end="00:48:34.759" style="s2">but I mean in 10 you know but</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:38.779" style="s2">pathological violence right but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.759" end="00:48:40.609" style="s2">otherwise this business of male female</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.779" end="00:48:42.890" style="s2">power dynamics in relation I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.609" end="00:48:45.799" style="s2">money like that&#39;s such a messy subject I</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.890" end="00:48:49.940" style="s2">don&#39;t go there but I totally agree I</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.799" end="00:48:54.289" style="s2">don&#39;t lead true you know female powers</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.940" end="00:48:59.150" style="s2">very psychological and they will powers</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.289" end="00:49:01.130" style="s2">physical and it&#39;s well I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.150" end="00:49:04.609" style="s2">the one of the aspects of female power</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.130" end="00:49:09.739" style="s2">is to constantly deny key male power and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.609" end="00:49:12.069" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s a psychological that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.739" end="00:49:15.499" style="s2">just not growing up fully yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.069" end="00:49:17.299" style="s2">not being a fully grown person to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.499" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">able to take responsibility for your</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.299" end="00:49:23.779" style="s2">entire for your behavior you know and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:25.910" style="s2">your emotionality the like Camille</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.779" end="00:49:27.650" style="s2">Talia&#39;s desire to make women strong</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.910" end="00:49:29.749" style="s2">women is to you know get over that kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.650" end="00:49:32.239" style="s2">of bullshit it&#39;s it is it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.749" end="00:49:33.380" style="s2">dry of course there are people snow men</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.239" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">two victims in the world</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:41.150" style="s2">totally convinced that women do not have</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.749" end="00:49:42.589" style="s2">number men by the way in victim each in</p>

<p begin="00:49:47.450" end="00:49:51.529" style="s2">feature of feminism which I find</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:53.630" style="s2">repulsive you know they&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.529" end="00:49:55.789" style="s2">going on about female victims and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.630" end="00:49:59.150" style="s2">don&#39;t seem don&#39;t seem acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.789" end="00:50:01.099" style="s2">fact that men are victims yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.150" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">don&#39;t believe for one second that women</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.099" end="00:50:06.170" style="s2">outnumber men as victims in the world I</p>

<p begin="00:50:27.110" end="00:50:30.860" style="s2">know how to say that but and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.970" end="00:50:32.050" style="s2">women are victims to be there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.860" end="00:50:36.670" style="s2">both victims</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.050" end="00:50:42.440" style="s2">Branko codependency victimology is is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.670" end="00:50:44.990" style="s2">goes both ways right so the real trick</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.440" end="00:50:47.390" style="s2">is for people to be filled fulfill the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.990" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">potential everybody and then when people</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.390" end="00:50:52.550" style="s2">whose potential is fulfilled they you</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:56.450" style="s2">you you get the sense of the fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.550" end="00:51:00.680" style="s2">life a very dynamic they&#39;re expressing</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.450" end="00:51:03.890" style="s2">right there you can you know like life</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.680" end="00:51:06.860" style="s2">is full and that&#39;s you know you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.890" end="00:51:08.500" style="s2">when someone is we have a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.860" end="00:51:10.940" style="s2">sense of when someone is not trying</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.500" end="00:51:13.190" style="s2">whether they&#39;re male or female and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.940" end="00:51:14.450" style="s2">that third task is to be cool about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.190" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">business of making people thrive</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.450" end="00:51:21.440" style="s2">including ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:23.180" style="s2">so it&#39;s very simple approach the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.440" end="00:51:24.950" style="s2">question is that what makes men thrive</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.180" end="00:51:26.540" style="s2">and what makes what makes women thrive</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.950" end="00:51:31.460" style="s2">and is there a difference is the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.540" end="00:51:33.260" style="s2">thing the psychometrics you know the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.460" end="00:51:38.780" style="s2">five personality test and stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.260" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">learned that was a major</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.780" end="00:51:44.150" style="s2">iOpener and so that that was really</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:45.350" style="s2">interesting man and more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.150" end="00:51:49.010" style="s2">ideas women are more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.350" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">aesthetics you know many more certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.010" end="00:51:54.410" style="s2">things will reverse did people these</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:55.700" style="s2">these are the avenues of development in</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.410" end="00:52:00.170" style="s2">other other there are other differences</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.700" end="00:52:05.600" style="s2">too but the the you know those are those</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.170" end="00:52:08.510" style="s2">are the biggies women are more neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.600" end="00:52:10.040" style="s2">than men which means they&#39;re in it when</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.510" end="00:52:12.320" style="s2">when rendered that&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.040" end="00:52:13.910" style="s2">negative thing but when rendered on when</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.320" end="00:52:15.560" style="s2">you turn that into a positive things it</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.910" end="00:52:17.090" style="s2">means that they&#39;re more vigilant to</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.560" end="00:52:20.090" style="s2">danger I think which is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.090" end="00:52:22.520" style="s2">intelligence yeah Esper I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.090" end="00:52:26.330" style="s2">about that that&#39;s the positive aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.520" end="00:52:29.160" style="s2">neuroticism is that a lot hyper-vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.330" end="00:52:31.230" style="s2">correct and and looking out for</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.160" end="00:52:33.150" style="s2">danger and so that&#39;s it intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.230" end="00:52:35.880" style="s2">dominant one according to the big flat</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.150" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">just on a neurotic person and and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.880" end="00:52:42.450" style="s2">think that I&#39;ve drawn I was upset when I</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:46.680" style="s2">first learned that but I&#39;ve more or less</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.450" end="00:52:48.510" style="s2">figured out that it has it&#39;s a huge part</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.680" end="00:52:50.940" style="s2">of my intelligence son I&#39;m constantly</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.510" end="00:52:56.039" style="s2">seeking out possible dangers you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.940" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of how I roll</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.039" end="00:53:02.339" style="s2">obviously it was a Seidel realm what</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:03.210" style="s2">people are thinking and how the way you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.339" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">know people are thinking could be</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.210" end="00:53:09.109" style="s2">dangerous that kind of thing so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:09.109" style="s2">an erotic thing to be doing all the time</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.280" end="00:53:19.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s good yeah so yeah so there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.970" end="00:53:21.329" style="s2">different avenues of development I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.470" end="00:53:25.619" style="s2">the traditional avenues like teaching</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.329" end="00:53:28.349" style="s2">men like you said martial arts in terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.619" end="00:53:30.569" style="s2">of how we can get out of this this big</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.349" end="00:53:33.299" style="s2">swing right now where people people seem</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.569" end="00:53:34.619" style="s2">to be asleep and especially men it</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.299" end="00:53:38.970" style="s2">seemed to be asleep they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.619" end="00:53:40.529" style="s2">escapist how they can carry on you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.970" end="00:53:42.779" style="s2">the word sovereignty I also think is</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.529" end="00:53:45.299" style="s2">related to the to to individualism</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.779" end="00:53:50.309" style="s2">becoming an individual becoming an</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.299" end="00:53:54.569" style="s2">undivided soul and undivided being is is</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.309" end="00:53:58.010" style="s2">to become a sovereign being though you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.569" end="00:54:00.089" style="s2">know its sovereignty really is</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.010" end="00:54:02.609" style="s2">transforming rather than disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.089" end="00:54:04.470" style="s2">its it there&#39;s a sense in which it is we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.609" end="00:54:06.270" style="s2">did turn a traditional sovereignty in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.470" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">other words being able to fight wars is</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.270" end="00:54:11.309" style="s2">now redundant but maybe there are mental</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:13.529" style="s2">wars maybe there&#39;s psychological wars</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.309" end="00:54:14.339" style="s2">you notice maybe there&#39;s wars against</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.529" end="00:54:16.490" style="s2">poor health</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.339" end="00:54:20.329" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s more was against the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.490" end="00:54:26.430" style="s2">environmental destruction he&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.329" end="00:54:27.869" style="s2">we can we sovereignty remains a an</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.430" end="00:54:29.970" style="s2">extremely important thing is just that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.869" end="00:54:31.619" style="s2">its meaning is transformed it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.970" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">longer the business of going off and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.619" end="00:54:35.369" style="s2">telling people but it might be the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:38.460" style="s2">business of killing has some some</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.369" end="00:54:40.619" style="s2">killing bad ideas exactly something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.460" end="00:54:41.829" style="s2">that or killing a killing conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.619" end="00:54:44.950" style="s2">madness and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.829" end="00:54:47.289" style="s2">in the society or you know hunting just</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.950" end="00:54:49.930" style="s2">taking somewhat of a risk taking someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.289" end="00:54:52.450" style="s2">risk right taking men got make men more</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.930" end="00:54:56.200" style="s2">inclined to take more risks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.450" end="00:54:57.640" style="s2">the there was a great interview and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.200" end="00:55:00.430" style="s2">probably heard it to David fuller</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.640" end="00:55:02.920" style="s2">together honey where she talked about</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.430" end="00:55:05.069" style="s2">the ash test now I only just know once I</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.920" end="00:55:08.259" style="s2">was listening again we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.069" end="00:55:09.880" style="s2">understand it would be better but she</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.259" end="00:55:11.380" style="s2">basically said that the ash test was</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.880" end="00:55:14.140" style="s2">about in lis fifties or something it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.380" end="00:55:17.769" style="s2">a test for conformism and they tested</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.140" end="00:55:19.209" style="s2">they found that men were basically 75</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.769" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">percent conformist in it and it had to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.209" end="00:55:24.339" style="s2">do with they were they were asked these</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:26.140" style="s2">questions they were able to see how the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.339" end="00:55:28.479" style="s2">people before them answered the question</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.140" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">it was kind of like a trick yeah I saw</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.479" end="00:55:32.950" style="s2">that the first seven people before them</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:35.890" style="s2">had answered the question in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.950" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">way so they were and and it was a trick</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.890" end="00:55:39.849" style="s2">because the way the seven people before</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:40.390" style="s2">them answered was wrong was the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.849" end="00:55:42.430" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.390" end="00:55:45.400" style="s2">and then they went ahead and gave the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.430" end="00:55:47.979" style="s2">same wrong answer so they and so they</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.400" end="00:55:50.109" style="s2">were testing conformism they found that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.979" end="00:55:53.519" style="s2">men were very conformist and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.109" end="00:55:55.989" style="s2">the percentage was seventy five percent</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.519" end="00:55:58.029" style="s2">but then they did the test a number of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.989" end="00:55:59.739" style="s2">years later on women exclusively and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.029" end="00:56:03.369" style="s2">found that women were more conformed she</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.739" end="00:56:08.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t say how much but it was a it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.369" end="00:56:11.229" style="s2">a kind of a surprising results to the to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.410" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">you know to that inquiry and so she well</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.229" end="00:56:15.130" style="s2">it may it make sense it&#39;s it&#39;s logical I</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:17.890" style="s2">mean if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a guy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.130" end="00:56:21.449" style="s2">physically stronger and so so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.890" end="00:56:24.449" style="s2">more likely to go out on a limb I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.449" end="00:56:28.900" style="s2">if you&#39;re a woman you you&#39;re you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.449" end="00:56:31.209" style="s2">you know you have to be hyper vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.900" end="00:56:33.489" style="s2">about children and how people are and</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.209" end="00:56:36.039" style="s2">then so so you you have that the rules</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.489" end="00:56:37.900" style="s2">matter much more right whereas it</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.039" end="00:56:40.569" style="s2">measures a man can sort of play around</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.900" end="00:56:42.219" style="s2">with the rules you can amend men like to</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.569" end="00:56:44.589" style="s2">do that they like to go it and could</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.219" end="00:56:46.529" style="s2">have bend the rules a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.589" end="00:56:49.900" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s my point women do too but</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.529" end="00:56:50.259" style="s2">more men more right here&#39;s here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.900" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.259" end="00:56:55.400" style="s2">we think</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">being risk takers but the ash test shows</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.400" end="00:57:02.599" style="s2">that most men are not oh yeah so in</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:03.740" style="s2">other words it&#39;s a it&#39;s a small minority</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.599" end="00:57:05.750" style="s2">of men</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.740" end="00:57:07.190" style="s2">most men are conformist they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.750" end="00:57:07.430" style="s2">to stick their neck out they want to fit</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.190" end="00:57:11.690" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.430" end="00:57:14.539" style="s2">oh yeah and the ash tests also showed</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.690" end="00:57:16.130" style="s2">that even more women are not that way so</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.539" end="00:57:18.650" style="s2">in other words is not that men are the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.130" end="00:57:20.510" style="s2">risk that group takers it&#39;s just that no</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.650" end="00:57:24.280" style="s2">but I mean there are more bits that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.510" end="00:57:24.280" style="s2">there are more men who are likely to</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.240" end="00:57:36.680" style="s2">that as well wait we just have to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:39.410" style="s2">over this problem with with there being</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.680" end="00:57:44.210" style="s2">differences like there&#39;s differences so</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.410" end="00:57:46.849" style="s2">what I mean you leave people alone you</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.210" end="00:57:51.319" style="s2">don&#39;t judge if a man wants to be a house</p>

<p begin="00:57:53.630" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">and you don&#39;t judge it the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.400" end="00:58:01.940" style="s2">with women if a woman wants to be out in</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.369" style="s2">this out in the workforce and she wants</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.940" end="00:58:06.920" style="s2">to hire a nanny to raise her kids then</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.369" end="00:58:11.029" style="s2">that&#39;s her business business but hers</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.920" end="00:58:13.670" style="s2">and and if she hold on hold on there</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.029" end="00:58:17.180" style="s2">well maybe there there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.670" end="00:58:23.329" style="s2">that&#39;s bad for children yes but if she</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.180" end="00:58:26.770" style="s2">chose it here&#39;s the thing she is a she</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.329" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">she has agency she has free choice and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.770" end="00:58:37.970" style="s2">maybe maybe she&#39;ll marry man but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:39.529" style="s2">truth is no we can criticize people for</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:42.309" style="s2">being good and bad parents but the truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.529" end="00:58:45.980" style="s2">is people have their disposition</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.309" end="00:58:48.020" style="s2">maternal and she has children I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.980" end="00:58:49.609" style="s2">got to live with that reality so it</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.020" end="00:58:53.210" style="s2">might be better for the kid to be with</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.609" end="00:58:57.349" style="s2">the nanny or something yeah we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.210" end="00:58:59.119" style="s2">is things are complex but in other words</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.349" end="00:59:00.990" style="s2">you but that doesn&#39;t mean that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.119" end="00:59:04.650" style="s2">don&#39;t make bad choices</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.990" end="00:59:06.119" style="s2">mean that you know we we have the usual</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.650" end="00:59:07.980" style="s2">social pressures to make people behave a</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.119" end="00:59:09.930" style="s2">little bit better when out where I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.980" end="00:59:12.840" style="s2">pointing out is the another paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.930" end="00:59:16.650" style="s2">feminism is that maternal ISM maternity</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.840" end="00:59:19.290" style="s2">is is looked down upon right yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.650" end="00:59:23.570" style="s2">and so the PERT though the woman who</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.290" end="00:59:28.080" style="s2">wants to be a mother is is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.570" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">discriminated against often and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.080" end="00:59:45.450" style="s2">can&#39;t really do that because because of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:47.160" style="s2">that however I do have something to say</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.450" end="00:59:50.160" style="s2">about maternity which is a complex thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.160" end="00:59:51.570" style="s2">and this screen this spring your</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.160" end="00:59:59.990" style="s2">thoughts but I found very disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.570" end="01:00:03.150" style="s2">facts so so man this is not the you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.990" end="01:00:06.180" style="s2">arguably I&#39;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.150" end="01:00:09.030" style="s2">thinking about the eradication of child</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.180" end="01:00:12.930" style="s2">mortality actually medication chocolate</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.030" end="01:00:16.619" style="s2">charity is arguably the most important</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.930" end="01:00:18.180" style="s2">human achievements period yeah if</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.619" end="01:00:19.800" style="s2">anybody else wants to argue that there</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.180" end="01:00:22.500" style="s2">is a more important human achievement</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.800" end="01:00:23.790" style="s2">than fine but it would it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.500" end="01:00:27.960" style="s2">strong argument that there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.790" end="01:00:29.609" style="s2">nothing matches that you know back not</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.960" end="01:00:31.530" style="s2">that back in history damn good point</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.609" end="01:00:36.270" style="s2">actually yeah not that far back in</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.530" end="01:00:40.859" style="s2">history most kids died we didn&#39;t hurt</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.270" end="01:00:43.830" style="s2">each other and that&#39;s a crazy and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.859" end="01:00:46.890" style="s2">it ended this is actually a huge feature</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.830" end="01:00:49.230" style="s2">of what we call female liberation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.890" end="01:00:51.810" style="s2">amazing how little it gets discussed I</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.230" end="01:00:53.970" style="s2">mean they were very very busy</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.810" end="01:00:56.730" style="s2">mostly failing to keep young children</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.970" end="01:01:00.060" style="s2">alive for a long long time and they had</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.730" end="01:01:02.580" style="s2">they were a major social machine that</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.060" end="01:01:04.740" style="s2">was their role it was an enormous role</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.580" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">absolutely enormous role and then it</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.740" end="01:01:11.160" style="s2">ended poof in a very in a very short</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:13.620" style="s2">period of history it was obscured to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.160" end="01:01:15.480" style="s2">fair to be fair to</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.620" end="01:01:17.580" style="s2">the lack of recognition of his</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.480" end="01:01:19.650" style="s2">achievement it was obscured by the wars</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.580" end="01:01:21.330" style="s2">that happened during the the the you</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.650" end="01:01:24.540" style="s2">know first happens when you century and</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.330" end="01:01:27.300" style="s2">so that was a time of great great tumult</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.540" end="01:01:29.550" style="s2">you know there was lots of reasons not</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.300" end="01:01:32.310" style="s2">to be celebrating you know we should</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.550" end="01:01:35.220" style="s2">have a week if not it&#39;s not several</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.310" end="01:01:39.230" style="s2">weeks in the course of the year to for</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.220" end="01:01:39.230" style="s2">festivities to celebrate the eradication</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.060" end="01:01:52.790" style="s2">anyway so what happened and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.420" end="01:01:52.790" style="s2">traditional female role was suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:02:01.370" style="s2">enormously the grave role was suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.280" end="01:02:03.780" style="s2">chopped down it was it just disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.370" end="01:02:05.700" style="s2">and so speak if you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.780" end="01:02:09.000" style="s2">the technological revolution in radical</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.700" end="01:02:12.330" style="s2">alienation it seems to me that there is</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.000" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">in the loss of purpose so so loss of</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.330" end="01:02:16.050" style="s2">purpose great a great alienation but</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:18.450" style="s2">let&#39;s take this another step further</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.050" end="01:02:20.220" style="s2">this is this is something that a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.450" end="01:02:23.610" style="s2">disturbing regime on the Stars things</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.220" end="01:02:27.270" style="s2">about this this is where its theory</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.610" end="01:02:29.880" style="s2">Freud was very worried loved us he you</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.270" end="01:02:31.890" style="s2">know with with their the loss of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.880" end="01:02:35.580" style="s2">great role they were very very busy they</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.890" end="01:02:37.290" style="s2">were also they they didn&#39;t add the</p>

<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:46.920" style="s2">fuckin all funny and then all of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.850" end="01:02:48.390" style="s2">sudden they have opens time and not only</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.920" end="01:02:51.780" style="s2">that they don&#39;t have any children and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.390" end="01:02:54.900" style="s2">they survive well what do they do they /</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.930" end="01:03:10.140" style="s2">maternity which has alienated maternity</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.380" end="01:03:13.050" style="s2">maternity it seems to me is best defined</p>

<p begin="01:03:13.050" end="01:03:20.370" style="s2">it this way it&#39;s best defined as the</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.740" end="01:03:24.110" style="s2">urgent drive to keep young children from</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.370" end="01:03:24.110" style="s2">perishing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.450" end="01:03:29.819" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t exist anymore well yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.180" end="01:03:32.430" style="s2">does exist I see it in my wife all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.819" end="01:03:35.730" style="s2">time it&#39;s very intense well it&#39;s now the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.430" end="01:03:38.700" style="s2">one child but but but but it&#39;s varied</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.730" end="01:03:41.579" style="s2">it&#39;s still there yes it was not the</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.700" end="01:03:43.559" style="s2">drivers only around for millennia and</p>

<p begin="01:05:43.260" end="01:05:49.930" style="s2">well one argument about one of my</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.650" end="01:05:51.490" style="s2">arguments feminist technology is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.930" end="01:05:53.470" style="s2">they&#39;re angry because they were</p>

<p begin="01:05:55.240" end="01:05:57.990" style="s2">off too well</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.830" end="01:06:05.890" style="s2">what is freedom let&#39;s say freedom</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.720" end="01:06:11.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t if you&#39;re liberated what are you</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.890" end="01:06:14.620" style="s2">gonna do right that&#39;s the thing freedom</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.740" end="01:06:16.240" style="s2">is not the whole story meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.620" end="01:06:19.720" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s the whole Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.240" end="01:06:22.660" style="s2">Pederson thing to fill the void where</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.720" end="01:06:24.130" style="s2">mere freedom you know because if we just</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.660" end="01:06:27.250" style="s2">gave you freedom wait we&#39;re just we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.130" end="01:06:31.660" style="s2">just gonna go crazy right yeah also have</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.250" end="01:06:34.420" style="s2">to you know total freedom is something</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.660" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">like I mean freedom can be fun and</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.420" end="01:06:37.840" style="s2">intent more intelligent ways but there</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:40.060" style="s2">is a sense in which freedom simply means</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.840" end="01:06:42.660" style="s2">nihilism just means nothing means</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.060" end="01:06:45.160" style="s2">meaninglessness and that&#39;s that moment</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.660" end="01:06:46.900" style="s2">that&#39;s a disturbing definition of</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.160" end="01:06:48.970" style="s2">freedom that we have to very quickly get</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.900" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">past you know you visited her the brief</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.970" end="01:06:56.170" style="s2">moment you see oh I don&#39;t want that no</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:58.870" style="s2">responsibilities you know just get drunk</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.170" end="01:07:04.120" style="s2">all the time on a beach trees or the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.870" end="01:07:05.590" style="s2">rest of my life I mean that&#39;s not nobody</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.120" end="01:07:08.410" style="s2">it&#39;s more profound than that is that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.590" end="01:07:10.900" style="s2">do have a lot of freedom rights we do</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.410" end="01:07:16.510" style="s2">have a lot of freedom but but we have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.900" end="01:07:17.260" style="s2">problem with meaning right yes use</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.510" end="01:07:21.730" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.260" end="01:07:23.500" style="s2">huge huge that&#39;s that&#39;s on both the male</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.730" end="01:07:25.210" style="s2">and female side you know men have this</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.500" end="01:07:27.190" style="s2">existential problem of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.210" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">I think women also have I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.190" end="01:07:32.470" style="s2">a different nature to both both to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:33.970" style="s2">meaning crisis right John Varick I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.470" end="01:07:36.250" style="s2">his name is he talks about the zombie</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.970" end="01:07:37.780" style="s2">you know the zombie craze right and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.250" end="01:07:40.030" style="s2">zombie craze just it&#39;s just meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.780" end="01:07:42.510" style="s2">it&#39;s people who have freedom but no</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.030" end="01:07:45.220" style="s2">meaning and all they do is consume right</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.510" end="01:07:47.110" style="s2">it&#39;s human brains and they consume</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.220" end="01:07:48.730" style="s2">whatever and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.110" end="01:07:52.060" style="s2">pathology but</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.730" end="01:07:54.460" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah no absolutely yeah once</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.060" end="01:07:58.180" style="s2">again the the technological revolution</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.460" end="01:08:00.310" style="s2">and its relationship to what we would</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.180" end="01:08:03.490" style="s2">think of as traditional male and female</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.310" end="01:08:06.790" style="s2">redundancy creates a brand-new reality</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.490" end="01:08:09.670" style="s2">which is new that&#39;s a new reality</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.790" end="01:08:14.050" style="s2">yeah male and female redundancy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.670" end="01:08:17.710" style="s2">yeah and traditional yeah but probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.050" end="01:08:20.190" style="s2">better and traditional male and female</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.710" end="01:08:26.370" style="s2">we don&#39;t see have been our products</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.190" end="01:08:29.350" style="s2">technological revolution and this is and</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.370" end="01:08:31.779" style="s2">this is enormous and we were reading</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.350" end="01:08:34.060" style="s2">from it and it&#39;s it was further than</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.779" end="01:08:37.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s human redundancy actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.060" end="01:08:39.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you think about it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.600" end="01:08:42.790" style="s2">scary yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the it</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.250" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">would be becomes a completely</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.790" end="01:08:48.040" style="s2">unconscious sort of creature right and</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:50.560" style="s2">as all of all of the work is or all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.040" end="01:08:52.900" style="s2">the the functions you know become</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.560" end="01:08:55.390" style="s2">redundant one of the good things about</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.900" end="01:08:59.259" style="s2">this a I scared</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.390" end="01:09:01.390" style="s2">which I&#39;m terrified of is it may be such</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.259" end="01:09:10.870" style="s2">a big problem that it&#39;ll it&#39;ll get men</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.390" end="01:09:15.640" style="s2">and women just just stop I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.870" end="01:09:22.270" style="s2">will you know it&#39;ll to collaborate to</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.640" end="01:09:24.370" style="s2">close I just don&#39;t believe that first of</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.270" end="01:09:25.779" style="s2">all women are more victims a greater</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.370" end="01:09:28.750" style="s2">victims than men in history I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.779" end="01:09:31.540" style="s2">believe that for one second I</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.750" end="01:09:33.850" style="s2">I believe that the burgeoning of male</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.540" end="01:09:37.420" style="s2">status the the inflation of men that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.850" end="01:09:40.330" style="s2">came at a great price to men as much as</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.420" end="01:09:42.250" style="s2">to women so the idea that men had it</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.330" end="01:09:44.049" style="s2">good for a few centuries and limited I</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.250" end="01:09:47.200" style="s2">mean there were centuries of</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.049" end="01:09:48.940" style="s2">unprecedented war it was it there was it</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.200" end="01:09:51.599" style="s2">was it was a totally imbalanced and</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.940" end="01:09:55.290" style="s2">difficult difficult time</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.599" end="01:09:58.679" style="s2">so it simply was the result of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.290" end="01:10:01.500" style="s2">confusion rapid technological change and</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.679" end="01:10:02.639" style="s2">which is continuing to this day to this</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.500" end="01:10:07.079" style="s2">day we&#39;re very confused about</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.639" end="01:10:09.030" style="s2">technological change and so so the fact</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.079" end="01:10:10.829" style="s2">that men were in charge of political</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.030" end="01:10:13.699" style="s2">power and this is somehow an injustice</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.829" end="01:10:16.230" style="s2">is a another</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.699" end="01:10:16.860" style="s2">misra it&#39;s just a misunderstanding the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.230" end="01:10:18.840" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.860" end="01:10:21.239" style="s2">I mean someone had to first of all</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.840" end="01:10:22.340" style="s2">create and run political power and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.239" end="01:10:24.630" style="s2">actually a terrible responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.340" end="01:10:27.210" style="s2">usually involves you know the king</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.630" end="01:10:31.469" style="s2">usually gets his head cut off at the end</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.210" end="01:10:34.469" style="s2">of his read so this this you know I</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.469" end="01:10:38.070" style="s2">don&#39;t think many women envied that role</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.469" end="01:10:40.530" style="s2">they saw exactly what it was they saw</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.070" end="01:10:43.679" style="s2">the man training to go to war and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.530" end="01:10:46.079" style="s2">you know exactly resentful that the men</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:49.099" style="s2">were out there you know training on time</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.079" end="01:10:49.099" style="s2">and then going off to war</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.810" end="01:10:58.619" style="s2">so this is and it&#39;s only later when when</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.560" end="01:11:02.940" style="s2">the the war redundancy begins to become</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.619" end="01:11:06.060" style="s2">within view that begins its journey</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.940" end="01:11:09.270" style="s2">towards men well you know if we want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.060" end="01:11:13.770" style="s2">if we want to rescue it or salvage any</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.270" end="01:11:15.599" style="s2">any part of feminism perhaps we this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.770" end="01:11:18.090" style="s2">what my thought was is it you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.599" end="01:11:21.389" style="s2">to throw the whole thing out because in</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.090" end="01:11:24.360" style="s2">terms of in terms of in terms of the you</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.389" end="01:11:26.550" style="s2">know of free choice and free everything</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.360" end="01:11:29.639" style="s2">you know free free self-determination</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.550" end="01:11:33.300" style="s2">for women that&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s a truism</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.639" end="01:11:34.170" style="s2">to say right that that&#39;s you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.300" end="01:11:37.590" style="s2">okay with that</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.170" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just that it&#39;s just that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.590" end="01:11:42.599" style="s2">resentment has to go it&#39;s like it seems</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:44.699" style="s2">like it seems that this is there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.599" end="01:11:49.699" style="s2">politics of resentment that is so</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.699" end="01:11:49.699" style="s2">utterly utterly utterly toxic</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.710" end="01:11:55.630" style="s2">two relationships between my first say</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.900" end="01:11:58.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard say that we&#39;re in the age of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.630" end="01:12:01.210" style="s2">the female shadow and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.630" end="01:12:03.340" style="s2">interesting way to look at it and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.210" end="01:12:08.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a reason to be optimistic because</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.340" end="01:12:10.330" style="s2">uh yeah because when you to be to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.800" end="01:12:13.180" style="s2">passing through the age of between a</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.330" end="01:12:14.860" style="s2">shadow is is to be in the process of</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.180" end="01:12:17.620" style="s2">becoming aware of the female shadow and</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.860" end="01:12:19.480" style="s2">then then they&#39;re passed again</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.620" end="01:12:20.950" style="s2">yeah I agree with that III I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.480" end="01:12:22.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s happening that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.950" end="01:12:23.950" style="s2">sounds right to me like the female</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.510" end="01:12:26.260" style="s2">shadow has to come out like it has to</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.950" end="01:12:28.300" style="s2">come out yeah like a like otherwise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.260" end="01:12:32.370" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just guess it has to come out</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.300" end="01:12:35.140" style="s2">and perhaps all this stuff is you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.370" end="01:12:39.100" style="s2">me too etc it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of a necessary</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.140" end="01:12:45.360" style="s2">sort of explosion of what has to come</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.100" end="01:13:14.200" style="s2">out on some bands like it to displace</p>

<p begin="01:13:28.120" end="01:13:31.600" style="s2">I had to this was hard this was really</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.250" end="01:13:34.210" style="s2">hard on me there couple years ago I</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.600" end="01:13:36.280" style="s2">really felt that there was a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.210" end="01:13:40.860" style="s2">which I was being knocked down too much</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.280" end="01:13:44.830" style="s2">and so what looks like learned the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.860" end="01:13:46.990" style="s2">biology of women that was a major I open</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.830" end="01:13:48.790" style="s2">it and then I could see that this was</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.990" end="01:13:50.950" style="s2">going to this was gonna blow all or he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.790" end="01:13:53.050" style="s2">gonna pass yet entrenched in some Dark</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.950" end="01:13:55.060" style="s2">Age which which in which men don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:13:55.060" end="01:13:59.050" style="s2">thing if that happens and there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.670" end="01:14:01.300" style="s2">of signs that men are improperly</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.050" end="01:14:02.160" style="s2">developing today so in there is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.300" end="01:14:04.650" style="s2">there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.160" end="01:14:06.690" style="s2">the necessity to criticize this and to</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.650" end="01:14:09.000" style="s2">articulate the way forward for men and</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.690" end="01:14:11.970" style="s2">women but you know men have to be able</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.000" end="01:14:15.000" style="s2">to figure out how they can go forward in</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.970" end="01:14:16.980" style="s2">this particular social climates the the</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.000" end="01:14:19.110" style="s2">way is simply to develop your potential</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.980" end="01:14:22.430" style="s2">find out who you are what your</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.110" end="01:14:24.840" style="s2">capacities are and develop them</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.430" end="01:14:27.360" style="s2">especially in an age of possible mass</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.840" end="01:14:30.390" style="s2">redundancy work we don&#39;t see you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.360" end="01:14:34.230" style="s2">you you should develop something even if</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.390" end="01:14:39.180" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t pay you know let&#39;s say if</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.230" end="01:14:43.040" style="s2">you&#39;re musical you should about yeah one</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.180" end="01:14:49.070" style="s2">very very dangerous part of feminism is</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.040" end="01:14:53.790" style="s2">the idea that the male psyche is so</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.070" end="01:14:56.610" style="s2">patriarchal that he that his it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.790" end="01:14:58.980" style="s2">completely lame like almost everything</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.610" end="01:15:00.870" style="s2">he says is laden with with patriarchal</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.980" end="01:15:03.840" style="s2">assumptions so so in other words</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.870" end="01:15:07.080" style="s2">basically according to the feminists the</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.840" end="01:15:10.650" style="s2">man the male psychological structure</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.080" end="01:15:14.520" style="s2">basically needs to be dismantled so a</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.650" end="01:15:17.820" style="s2">feminist not often this but but there</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.520" end="01:15:20.940" style="s2">are feminists out there strong our core</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.820" end="01:15:24.690" style="s2">feminists who see it as a moral</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.940" end="01:15:26.690" style="s2">imperative to dismantle the male male</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.690" end="01:15:29.730" style="s2">psychological structure which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.690" end="01:15:35.460" style="s2">fundamentally pathological it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.730" end="01:15:36.900" style="s2">so it will only create I know what it</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.460" end="01:15:40.080" style="s2">will create I have the words for it it</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.900" end="01:15:42.870" style="s2">will create hell on earth yes yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.080" end="01:15:44.580" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing there is no that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.870" end="01:15:47.970" style="s2">one of the worst ideas that has ever</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.580" end="01:15:50.700" style="s2">been and and there&#39;s a lot of feminists</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.970" end="01:15:53.010" style="s2">who believe this and when I say</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.700" end="01:15:55.680" style="s2">feminists like glued male feminists they</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.010" end="01:15:57.900" style="s2">believe it and it&#39;s a very very bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.680" end="01:16:00.300" style="s2">it&#39;s an absolutely miserable onion and</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.900" end="01:16:02.370" style="s2">the way to counter that is to articulate</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.300" end="01:16:06.600" style="s2">properly what the word sovereignty means</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.370" end="01:16:08.910" style="s2">and then to also point out female sexual</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.600" end="01:16:11.439" style="s2">selection is actually played an</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.910" end="01:16:12.880" style="s2">extremely important role in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.439" end="01:16:14.969" style="s2">and the reinforcements of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.880" end="01:16:16.630" style="s2">over the generation after generation</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.969" end="01:16:19.329" style="s2">throughout millennia</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.630" end="01:16:22.419" style="s2">so it&#39;s in other words the women are</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.329" end="01:16:25.179" style="s2">very they breed its sovereignty intimate</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.419" end="01:16:27.729" style="s2">and this and and this is like benefit</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.179" end="01:16:29.349" style="s2">this is ultimately a something very</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.729" end="01:16:31.869" style="s2">beneficial to the to the human condition</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.349" end="01:16:34.979" style="s2">provided that it is fully understood and</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.869" end="01:16:34.979" style="s2">it&#39;s fully important</p>
