<p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">i think it may qualify as ben it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">late early august i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s only the beginning of the end yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">it is that all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:35.360" style="s2">let&#39;s just get right into it we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">couple of questions from episode 37</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.360" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve got uh one from earlier that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.079" end="00:00:41.440" style="s2">kept on forgetting to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:43.120" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve got one from the discord</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.440" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">so i have told the find people at</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.120" end="00:00:46.879" style="s2">discord who were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:48.640" style="s2">in voting on questions i said we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.879" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">going to do a voting system in general</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.640" end="00:00:52.719" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">um up to one um also the cat does not</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">get a vote no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:59.920" style="s2">um but up to one one question</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">a week if they want to vote on uh we</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.920" end="00:01:04.000" style="s2">will answer it here so we&#39;ve got one</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">like that here so you guys can oh no you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">get ears you can see the ears right okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">um there we go um</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">first question all right from episode 37</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">uh did consciousness and big brains</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">evolve in homo sapiens it would seem</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">that sapiens babies being useless for</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">years would have been an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">end so i said last time wow that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">question this warrant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:30.400" style="s2">whole lifetimes of research um but</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">i i did promise that we&#39;d come back to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">it and talk a little bit about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">uh and you&#39;re looking at me like you got</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">you got it in five words or less you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:41.119" style="s2">name that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">answer in five words yeah i think we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">do this i mean you know it synonymizes</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">well it doesn&#39;t synonymize but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:51.159" style="s2">combines consciousness and big brains</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">and i think we know the answer for</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.159" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">disproportionately big brains which</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.719" style="s2">comes from</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">so i&#39;m borrowing from dick alexander</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">my phd advisor who argued</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">that there was an arms race between</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">human populations that there&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">called ecological dominance at which</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">human beings become</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">the most important hostile force for</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">other human beings and at that point</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">thinking about what competitor groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">are going to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">counteracting it with your own clever</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">strategies becomes the way to get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">and so basically human against human</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.760" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">population level</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">conflict resulted in an arms race that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">enlarged our brains so we could out</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">think each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">and i would argue that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">fits that model that consciousness is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">tool</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">deployed for novelty and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">that basically in order to out-think</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">human competitor&#39;s consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">therefore collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">engagement on abstract questions was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">key tool</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m going to add two things here</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to clarify one thing you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">said which is you use the term hostile</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">which is a reference to darwin&#39;s term</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">hostile forces</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">where he was imagining i think he split</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">it into biotic and abiotic although</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a later</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">uh addition he was looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">hostile forces that individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">species were having to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">and seeing things like weather and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">climate and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">predators and competitors and pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">uh and parasites and seeing that these</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">were the selective forces</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">uh that species were evolving uh you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2">know basically away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">it or enabling themselves to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.840" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">respond to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">and dick alexander&#39;s one of dick</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">alexander&#39;s many remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">contributions to understanding of human</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">evolution was to see</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">uh impart uh humans as</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">our own most significant hostile force</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">in human evolution so that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">point just slightly clarifying uh for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">those who didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">you know who might have imagined that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">you were just saying hostile forces</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">because it seemed like the right words</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">i think they are the right words but</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">this is a literally a darwinian term</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">and then i would also say to the second</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">part of this question and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">wrapped up together</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">it would seem that homo sapiens babies</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">being useless for years would have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">an evolutionary dead end</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">um this this gets at the question of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">effectively why why parental care you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">know why</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">on a a continuum of ways to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">would you ever go away from i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">going to have as</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">many kids as possible but because that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">means that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">way more than i a parent could ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">engage with</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">i&#39;m never going to probably meet any of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">them so lots and lots of kids totally</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">anonymous to the parents</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:39.199" style="s2">all the way to what we see in humans and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">some other species</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">where you have very few children at a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">time and every one of them is precious</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">and you invest</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">remarkably in them as you move um you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">one of the ways that some of you will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">familiar with this has been called is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">um excuse me r versus k selection but as</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">you move</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">over towards that sort of human dolphin</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">wolf other great apes uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">um elephant end of the spectrum uh you</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">end up with not just more and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">parental care but more and more uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">altricial children so we all know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">word precocious</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">you know a kid who seems to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">speak in full sentences before you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">expecting them to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not exactly the same word but a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">precocial</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">infant in a species is one that can like</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">neo-right-wingers and considers that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">giving it a chance</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">considers that to be sufficiently giving</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">it a chance unbiased research so</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">basically he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">what do i do do i do i need to leave</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">um he also adds later um</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">that they&#39;re both people of color but</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">he&#39;s got some white in them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">she&#39;s never done it but he&#39;s afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">if they had kids together it would</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">this would this would start getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">crowded out in an argument these sorts</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">you know most fundamental racial</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">differences so what to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">well i mean seems to me one of two</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:18.080" style="s2">is very likely going on one is</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">that this is a very dire indicator of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.080" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">failure that there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">in the relationship we&#39;re in the human</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">being well in the person&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">that to the extent of the girlfriend</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">yeah to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">that uh i mean you know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">dismissed as right-wingers</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">you know since before idw was a thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">the problem is it doesn&#39;t withstand</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">scrutiny of the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s one thing for a person</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">to have this mistake and impression</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s another thing for them to retain</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">the mistaken impression when confronted</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">with the ample evidence that for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">idw has many left-wingers in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">would argue it&#39;s more left-wingers than</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">right-wingers</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">right that is relatively easy to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">and somebody who doesn&#39;t change their</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">position in the face of evidence i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">could be other objections but you should</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">drop that one and if you don&#39;t drop that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">one it&#39;s because there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">that&#39;s holding on to it maybe though</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">then maybe maybe what we could offer</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">is and you know without knowing either</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">these people maybe it&#39;s impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">you know how</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">how could he have that conversation like</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">how could he approach such a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">conversation it may be that when she</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">comes at him</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">like this he has the sense of like i am</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">not allowed to speak i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">engage this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">i&#39;m expected to be silent here because</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">she&#39;s making this point that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">allowed to object to like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">what could be done to even just open up</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">of a of a two-way channel as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">what sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">him receiving this and feeling like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">my god what have i gotten myself into</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">except she&#39;s so wonderful in these other</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">regards</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">well so that was what i was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">about the other possibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">okay the other possibility is that this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">is not a failure of her</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">cognitive model it&#39;s a failure in social</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">space where the cost of admitting that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to idw stuff in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">circles</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">is so high that there are people and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.120" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">now hearing a lot of these stories of</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">know better but are holding to some</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:15.200" style="s2">else to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">and you know in fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.200" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">we are now receiving troubling</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">indications that people who have</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">overwhelming them with this woke stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:29.680" style="s2">and you know people who were</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">clear-headed are losing their</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">their clear-headedness and so look</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">is the most important decision you will</p>

<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">and it is important</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">that it be built out of something sound</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">and what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">is if your girlfriend is suffering from</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">fear of what her social group will make</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:01.200" style="s2">her awareness or openness to hearing idw</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.200" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">whatever stuff it might be then you need</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">a place in your relationship where you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">can be honest with each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t put her in a bind when</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">she talks to other people she may not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">able to solve</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">her social bind and she may not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">walk away from people she values who are</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">or broken on this issue so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">you know the ability when you close the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">door of your house to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">talk about what&#39;s really going on even</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">if you can&#39;t you know i mean look this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">has happened in every one of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">tragic situations</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the reason that you know the stasi</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">and the soviets you know did so much</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">spying on their own population</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">is that people very frequently knew what</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">was going on and even if in public they</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">maintained their discipline and talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">parties that were oppressing them in</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">private they spoke about the truth</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">and it seems to me that that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">necessary and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">you need to have a space where you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">converse honestly</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">where you you can&#39;t no matter how much</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">of an introvert and how self-sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">uh and i can i i count myself pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">strongly in both of those things you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">need to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">at least one and preferably more but at</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">least one person</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">to whom you can speak totally honestly</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">about what it is that you think might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:22.959" style="s2">and not fear reprisal in the outside</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">world as a result</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.959" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">yeah not fear being outed in a social</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">environment so if it were me i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">probably say</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">you know look honey what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t add up and i&#39;m i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">that the reason that you would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t add up</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">is because this is a very frightening</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:41.920" style="s2">moment and people have</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">gotten really aggressive about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.920" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">stuff but let&#39;s talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">really is true and then talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">predicament that knowing what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">true puts you in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">in the outside world i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">if she can hear that but if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">what&#39;s going on it&#39;s it&#39;s at least a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">strong possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">um she will register it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">all right next question this this from</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">the discord</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:10.320" style="s2">how uh trigger warning no</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">um this uses a word that i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.320" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">so i had to look it up so as i read it</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:15.839" style="s2">if you see if you hear a word you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">know don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll define it</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.839" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">how does the discrepancy between</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:21.040" style="s2">biological and cultural sexual maturity</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">lead to harmful paraphilias</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.040" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">such as ephebophilia how can we use</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">evolutionary theory to square this</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">equation and reduce the harm to our</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">society&#39;s youth</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">so ephemophilia being the particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">type of paraphilia like you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">particular kind of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">that is defined as being attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">sort of mid to late adolescence</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">so how does the discrepancy mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">biological and cultural sexual maturity</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">um lead to to such a thing and i how i</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">read this</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">question is um at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">we have uh men and women</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">who we have 18 to 25 year olds</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">who inhabit the bodies of adults but</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">often are not yet adults so they</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">cultural sexual maturity lags behind</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">biological sexual maturity</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">uh and this is uh potentially dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not even sure i would put it</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">that way i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">there is a question about so we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">frequently about the fact that men have</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">two reproductive strategies</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:23.199" style="s2">one of those strategies is what one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">my students</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.199" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">labeled so and go so in go</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">is just purely a matter of delivering a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">gamete and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">not taking responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">consequences this is a bargain</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">for men evolutionarily speaking it also</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">is not likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">historically to have been a very common</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">successful mode</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">outside of rape where men force the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">situation and war</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">now war which includes outside of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">extreme situations</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">yeah right so in normal functioning</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">societies</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">um women are selected not to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">reproduce with men who won&#39;t commit</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">because the cost of raising offspring is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">so high</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">that um the fact that women are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">limiting sex that they deliver something</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:09.839" style="s2">of high value in this regard means they</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">are in a good bargaining position to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.839" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">demand</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">commitment etc but because reproducing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">without commitment is such</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">a bargain for men evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">men cannot resist the implication that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">it might be possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">and so what we have is this coupled with</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">the fact that birth control</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">now makes it possible for women to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">engage in sex without nearly so much</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">danger of ending up with a baby that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">they can&#39;t raise</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">um these things have combined to lower</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">the bar to having sex and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">has resulted in new mores arising</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">with respect to who one is allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">have sex with</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">and the problem is that basically the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">rules as we now have them</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">are well if woman can sense then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">okay</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">just are predatory from the point of</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">um that young women who do not yet have</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">to actually understand why they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">commanding so much attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">what its meaning is to you know to suss</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">out that they&#39;re being lied to by men</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">something is going on that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">but basically to me the way i read this</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">at the heart of that you know you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">you never had the experience of coming</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">and i will say that um</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">you know everyone within a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">certain distance of societal beauty</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">uh who comes of age uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">at least until the last i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">what it&#39;s going to be 10 or 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">maybe um has this experience that at one</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">level feels very sudden</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">you go from child and you still feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">like a child and now you are just the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">object of so much</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">attention and you cannot escape it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">this is this is the real part of what</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">the male gaze is right you cannot escape</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">and when you are fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">in your own self and you&#39;re out there</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">engaging with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">and you know if you&#39;re lucky and smart</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">you have to be both and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">avoid having any really bad interactions</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">with you know actual predators which</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">most of the people most of them men</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:43.679" style="s2">looking at young women are not predators</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">by a large</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">degree but you learn to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.200" style="s2">by being out there and experiencing it a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.200" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">right and i&#39;m not saying that that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">wonderful in any way but you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">learn to figure out how to navigate and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:02.720" style="s2">especially because of all the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">infantilization that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.720" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">and because so much of the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">activity is happening behind screens</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">you have you have this just you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">constant display</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">of the you know fully new biosexualized</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">bodies</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">of young women who think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">where their worth comes from</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">and they all they get are the comments</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">back which are some combination</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">of you know repugnant and disgusting and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">apparently congratulatory but</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">they&#39;re not real and it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">tell one anonymous account from another</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">what who are these guys and how do i</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">well and you know the other thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">i think on the female side we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">completely failing to convey something</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">that one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">uh older female relatives would once</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">have conveyed very clearly which is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">men and women or no men looking for</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">for sex and men looking for women for</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">partnership</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">are in very different states of mind men</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">ought to have a very low bar</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">evolutionarily speaking men ought to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">have a very low bar</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">for desirability for some to have sex</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">with somebody and a very high bar</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">for wanting to partner with somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">raise a family and so in that second</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">phase men are very much like women they</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">set of priorities but they have very</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">high standards they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">choosy in this other phase they may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">very so if you&#39;re a female and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">that attracting male sexual attention is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">not one thing it&#39;s two different things</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">then the point is and one of them takes</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">nothing and it actually potentially puts</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">you in harm&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">right in fact we know beauty counts a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">lot but youth counts a lot too and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:48.960" style="s2">women come online sexually they discover</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.960" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">there&#39;s i have all of this power i can</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">detect that i can screw up a room full</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">of people by</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">you know my behavior so a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">tragically that may be the height</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">of power that most women experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:07.360" style="s2">in their life is the sexual power that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">comes from</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.360" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">the youth and the fact that in ancestral</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">circumstances that was just simply a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">measure of how many offspring they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.600" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">likely to be able to produce in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">and it uh if you prioritize maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">that power</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">which inherently comes when you&#39;re young</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">it will get in the way of you learning</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">the things that you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">in order to actually have more</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">interesting kinds of power over which</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">you have some control</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">and for which you would deserve some</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">credit exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">the problem though is that because</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">constructed so poorly a woman who</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">foregoes</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">the exercise of that purely sexual</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">youth-based power</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.159" style="s2">is not necessarily in a situation to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">the kinds of skills and knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">insight that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">cause her to have more power later in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">life when it was about something</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">that she had brought to the world right</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">so anyway we&#39;ve got this tragic</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">situation we don&#39;t tell women look</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested in men that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">kind of attention you will get</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">from uh flashing your boobs or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">is real but it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">translate into you will find a mate who</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">worthy of you and uh and all of that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">convey that lesson and we we arm women</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">poorly</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">we simply teach you know to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">that that&#39;s taught it&#39;s simply taught as</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:35.120" style="s2">be modest right like have modesty</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">without identifying that there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">that like male attention as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">as you just said is not one thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not one thing and the trivial</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">version isn&#39;t really worth</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">attracting it&#39;s too easy to attract and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t translate into anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">right so anyway what i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">in a world in which there is just power</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that men</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">are focused on young women especially</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">when it&#39;s in the phase</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">about women that they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">continue to care about which has to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.039" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">with fertility pure and simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">and so it is not the same thing the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">uh men of all ages in that phase</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">in that mental state are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">very young women</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">is a problem civilization should not be</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">encouraging that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">and to the extent that we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">encouraging that it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">deranged the sexual landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">created a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">may not be illegal but is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">predatory in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">you know it&#39;s men taking advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">women who don&#39;t know better</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">next question totally different topic</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">hypothesis on kovid risk cholesterol</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">and other sterols are foundational to</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">d-group vitamins</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">hormones cellular structure i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">exactly what the relationship is there</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">common statins lower total ldl</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">interfering with normal function without</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">addressing damaged and oxidized</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">ldl thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">i feel like there&#39;s a connection i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">know what statins are</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">i think doing this is off the top</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">okay i believe there&#39;s some evidence</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">that statins are actually increasing</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">covered risk</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">so that&#39;s the thing that that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">true for this to track for me for this</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">question to track so i think i recall</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">reading that somewhere a month or so ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">i hope it wasn&#39;t something we said here</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">which guess i&#39;ve totally forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">right well yeah so be it um but in any</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">case i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">mechanistic hypothesis for why that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">would be the case</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">akin to the um why do uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">proton pump inhibitors increase covet</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">from our last q a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">yeah so what if if if that&#39;s right if</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">the missing piece</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">uh in the question is that statins use</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">of statins</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">is associated with an increased risk of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">either contracting</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">or a degree of of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">disease the badness of the disease</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">of covid uh what do we think of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">i mean i guess potential</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">i just don&#39;t know i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">enough about the molecular biology to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">totally assess it at first pass</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:10.400" style="s2">it looks reasonable like each of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">seem like causal lengths that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.400" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">plausible</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">well i&#39;ll tell you um if this were class</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">i would tell you</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">yeah the next thing you need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">figure out what the prediction is of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">this hypothesis that distinguishes it</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">other potential explanations and so i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:27.360" style="s2">be very curious if there is a unique</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">well for instance like are there other</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">common drugs that are given to lower</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">total ldl</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">such that um you know if statins do this</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">and this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:39.760" style="s2">um and the missing piece of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.279" style="s2">that we&#39;ve identified is correct</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.760" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">um the prediction would be that those</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.279" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">other drugs that also lower total</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">ldl would have the same effect and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">they would also be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">a higher risk of covin so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">that would be one prediction or</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">that lower ldl without a drug oh good</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">yeah yeah next question</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">hawaii has instated a new emergency</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">order on oahu</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">all beaches parks and trails are closed</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">as outside is safer do you guys think</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">the purpose of this is more to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">discourage tourists the 14-day</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">quarantine for visitors is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">ignored</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">well that&#39;s a good hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">yeah the other hypothesis is that this</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">comes from the same confusion that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">people seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">where they&#39;re almost mistaking a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">signaling function um for</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">an epidemiological intervention like</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">look at me i&#39;m careful i&#39;m wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">mask even though i&#39;m outside</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">alone yeah we&#39;re serious about covered</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">bad stuff is going to happen we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">serious about</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">you can tell we&#39;re serious because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">yeah so i hate that this is going on but</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">we see it every time</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">we go out we run into people i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">got that i got the side eye today i was</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">out walking in a park</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">um alone and someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">uh someone walked by in a mask it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">just the two of us in the park</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">and she glared at me i wasn&#39;t wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">mask of course i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">right like for god&#39;s sake you need to i</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m not who she thinks i am and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t wearing my star or i was and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">all of this is has become so</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">tribal yeah tribal and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">we are foregoing opportunities that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">need to avail ourselves of because at</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">outside is so hospitable um but i was</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">going to say the last time we went</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">kayaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">two guys walking down a beach</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">um wearing masks you know more than six</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">feet apart the two guys are</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">scampering or bouldering yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">wearing masks you know it&#39;s not only are</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">they outdoors there&#39;s a breeze</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">there&#39;s the sun is shining and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">unless they lived right there they</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">got there in the same car i mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">they were masks in the car but you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">it&#39;s possible they were protecting</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">themselves from each other is my point</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">if if not that though there was no</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">i agree but i i don&#39;t think they needed</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">to to protect themselves from each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">yeah on the beach</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">so the point is look you&#39;ve got some</p>

<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">reasons the us seems to be screwing up</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">the covet response so badly</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">is that we have a low tolerance for um</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">being told what to do especially being</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">that the individualism which is so much</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.000" end="00:27:28.000" style="s2">is our achilles heel when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">epidemiological stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">you know frankly wearing a mask isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:36.399" style="s2">it kind of sucks i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.279" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">good but i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.399" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">as you know it&#39;s far short of gulag</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">you know it is i mean i was i mean you</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">mean we&#39;re now mandated to but i was</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">wearing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">in grocery stores hardware stores before</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">it was mandated</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">um because it was clearly the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">thing to be doing but i hate it and as</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">soon as i&#39;m clear of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">their the hvac you know not as soon as i</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">walk out the door but as soon as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">clear of anything that feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">blowing stuff out from the store</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">i take it off sooner than than most</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">people do</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">well but look this is in part</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">a failure of the market we should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">delivering something that does the job</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have this impact and in</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">fact i was going to propose</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">winter is coming um what we need are</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">scarves that work</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">imagine that this came down to a scarf</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">that you wrapped around your face and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">everybody understood that that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">functional and that it was constructed</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">of the sorts of materials that would do</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">this job effectively and then the point</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">suddenly this isn&#39;t a mask right</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">but interesting we need to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">you know i&#39;m watching all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:48.960" style="s2">people wearing you know their mask</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">under their chin when they don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.960" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">on and it&#39;s just like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">comfortable it looks crazy</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">and you know we just don&#39;t have infinite</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">tolerance for that stuff so what we need</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">is something</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">that we do have infinite tolerance for</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">and in the meantime we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">the period of time we&#39;re not threatened</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">you know by taking the thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">off and feeling like okay good you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">i i guarantee you professional skiers</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:16.240" style="s2">do not go to bed with their ski boots on</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">you know they take them off</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.240" end="00:29:19.679" style="s2">and that allows them to tolerate the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">boots you know when they&#39;re working but</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.679" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be safer if they were ready</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.279" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">to ski at any moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">slightly you never know but</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">but anyway yeah we should be we should</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">be borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">so that we can spend on it when we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">okay another uh covered question between</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">mild and asymptomatic cases</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">and newly discovered t cell immunity i</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">don&#39;t know about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">is is spread wider than we thought and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">close to burning out before a vaccine is</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">cases are declining in texas florida and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">arizona</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">former hot spots such as new york city</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">sweden pakistan and italy seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">heard immunity</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple claims in here that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">i just don&#39;t know about i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">newly discovered t-cell immunity or that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">cases are declining in those three</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:07.039" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">um i would since you you know more</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.039" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">mostly i i will</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">let you answer this primarily but i will</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">say the concept of hurt immunity is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">is a dangerous one um we we know the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">tests</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">suck so we really don&#39;t know who has</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">been exposed that didn&#39;t test positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">at the time and even if you didn&#39;t test</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">positive at the time if you hadn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:26.880" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to doubt it but um</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.880" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">the antibody tests are terrible as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">but herd immunity is a concept that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">makes terrific</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">sense if your model is did you die or do</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.320" style="s2">and as we&#39;ve said over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">there&#39;s there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.320" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">growing concerns about um</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">serious symptoms systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">harmed even after you&#39;ve survived covet</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">and of course we have no idea what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:58.640" style="s2">actual long-term damage might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">yeah and i feel quite certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.640" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">that i do not feel certain we will be</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">able to detect this on the basis of how</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">crummy our data is on who actually had</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">this thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">but i feel quite certain that given the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:12.480" style="s2">massive damage that seems to accompany</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">these cases</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">in many ways even people who didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">symptoms seem to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">risk</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">brain damage and heart damage yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">this is going to knock years maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">decades off people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">yep and we are not tracking that well so</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">what i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">it is possible that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">herd immunity has some utility here and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">that we would you know your question is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">will we get there before a vaccine is</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">possibly however we will get there at</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">what cost</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">if some large fraction of the population</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">has had this disease and is going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">have chronic health conditions for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">rest of their lives and live</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">shorter lives as a result then what a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">terrible price for</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">herd immunity so um</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">not sure but it&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">something we should bank on</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">indeed</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">huge generational divide in the</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">more of a more of a comment although</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">it is telling that i don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">the person who&#39;s writing</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">lives um but that it was medicare that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">split the democratic party and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">you know this may be an aspect of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:54.000" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t been talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">it seems like it&#39;s woke</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.000" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">that is that is going to be splitting</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">the democrats</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">and is so polarizing people away from</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">the democrats but that there are going</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">to be splinter issues all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">different it&#39;s basically becoming what</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">you know maybe it was always true</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">but it felt in the 90s uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">like the republicans were a collection</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">of special interest groups that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">really have a lot to do with one another</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">you know what what were the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">two-way enthusiasts doing with the white</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">evangelical christians inherently you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">know what was the connection there</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">but increasingly clearly the democrats</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">are are this</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">a bunch of special interest groups that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">are that are together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">unfortunately seeming to try to unite</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">under this sort of intersectional</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">woke flag it&#39;s a natural outgrowth</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">of the abandonment of uh basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">wages and protections for workers as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">signature issue yep</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">thanks for being a beacon of</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">do you think mankind view ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">our race in a sufficiently evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">is it possible that our perception of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">reality is far less accurate than we</p>

<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">um well i want to completely understand</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">what we do is we have a distortion</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">that has been adaptive in past</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">that distortion was never accurate and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">in fact i&#39;ve argued that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">self is itself a distortion built to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">you to behave in ways that are adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">for something</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">that one would call lineage the problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">that our distortion which is adaptive is</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">built for an environment we don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s out of place and distorted</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">which makes it very difficult for us to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">we should have which would either be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">new distortion</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">that worked for our modern environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">or an undistorted view</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">that would allow us to correct for</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">whatever errors</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">through analytically understanding them</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">and we have neither so basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">we are involved in an infinite cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">self-harm</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">that um is uh pretty needless</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">but this is part of a big part of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to address in the book that</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">we&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">right um provide uh sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">access to the evolutionary toolkit such</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">individuals can begin to assess the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">hyper novel situation that we&#39;re in and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">uh that thread the needle between</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">harkening back to traditional solutions</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">that continue to work</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">and looking for better solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">have not been imagined before</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">pooled batch group those are all</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">alternative synonyms i think pooled</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">batch and group pcr testing</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">could cheaply and frequently test</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">everyone in developed countries</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">can you please validate and magnify this</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">idea among your media and elite media</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">circles</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know what it means to test</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">everybody you could see</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:05.920" style="s2">whether or not there was anybody in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:09.040" style="s2">group that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">uh infected and then you need to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">start punching it down right yep um and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">yeah i guess</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">it will work</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">depending on what the background rate of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">infection is or</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">of pass infection is um</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">you would need different sizes of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">initial groups to maximize the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">efficacy and the efficiency of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">um because well i won&#39;t go into the math</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">yeah you know it would require a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">tinkering but i absolutely agree that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:42.480" style="s2">um i guess i haven&#39;t heard it called all</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">those things but pooled pcr testing</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">uh where you collect whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">saliva right sometimes blood um</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">um or is pcr always blood no no then</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">i had no pcrs is i had a nasal swab</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">nasal swell okay so</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">mucosal membrane stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">yeah you collect from you know hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">of people at a time and just do</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">one test um this it could cheaply and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">frequently test everyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">the questions again and still and always</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">is how reliable is the test</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">so this would be a way of getting more</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">people tested faster</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">and anytime you had a positive you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">have to go in and you know split a group</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">of 2000 into 10 groups of uh 200 and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">you know sorted out that way but um it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">still requires that the testing is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">hyper accurate and we just don&#39;t i see</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">no evidence of it being so</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">yeah i mean the number of anecdotes</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">every day i hear more anecdotes</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">from people i know and people i only</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">know online but like</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">saying yep my doctor declared me an</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">official false negative</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">visual false negative yeah the hell so i</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">think uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">i would have to look into whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">it actually was the case but i have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">sense that this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">um a case of massive market failure</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">where you know a a public effort to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">produce tests might have produced</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:03.680" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about not the failure not</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">the failure to pool pcr testing but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.680" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">failure</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">of the test themselves the low quality</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">of the tests</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">is a result i think of many private</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">efforts to generate a test</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">that were saleable because there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">anything much better</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">and yes i don&#39;t know what would have</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">happened if a much better test</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">had emerged would it have succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">uh competitively but at some level</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">this didn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">it you know unless there&#39;s some reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t make a good test</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">uh this was the biggest failure of all</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">because it just blinded you at every</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">level you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">tell what damage there was you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">tell how it spread because you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t have good data on who didn&#39;t who</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">didn&#39;t have it nope there are no there</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">there can no there can not be good data</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">now yeah from earlier there could be</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">good data going forward at some point</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">presumably</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">love the show just bought the de cameron</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">thanks for expanding my reading list</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">are certain values such as individual</p>

<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">and the change focused left</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:19.599" style="s2">can these values reverse in different</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">contexts such as the ussr versus the us</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.599" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">or historically</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">yeah i think this is why we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">debate or at least we&#39;re having a debate</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">about classical liberals who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">conservative</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">which is that these things were uh once</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">liberal values they</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">they succeeded and now conservatives are</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">defending them</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">so yes we have a confusion between</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">our relative terms about which direction</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">we should go in our absolute terms about</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">values but yes they can reverse this</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">does confound me like</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">i think anyone with any sense of history</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">understands that for instance</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">parties come to change what they stand</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">for over time right</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">but the idea that left versus right you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">know having</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">you know being more focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">individual rights and freedom versus</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">being more focused</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">on making sure that everyone in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">society has</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">some human rights and being more focused</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">perhaps on justice</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">but in both cases understanding that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">freedom loving people on</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">the right and the justice loving people</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:23.760" style="s2">on the left recognize that there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">trade-offs and that there&#39;s no one on</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.760" end="00:40:26.800" style="s2">the right who doesn&#39;t also understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">the value of justice nor is there anyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:29.839" style="s2">who is on the left doesn&#39;t also</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">understand the value of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">that those those seemed stable to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">but even that seems to be increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">muddled well it does make conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">increasingly difficult as well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">wondering if this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">thing we were wrestling with in the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:46.640" style="s2">first hour</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">where it seems that these even these</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.640" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">things are being lost</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">because actually we&#39;re now having a</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">conversation without content</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">yeah um yeah maybe that&#39;s it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">another request to invite a guest neil</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">okay so i&#39;ll just put both of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">suggestions in yellow for us to return</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">great are cosmetics an extended human</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">phenotype</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">women often use cosmetics to increase</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">their attractiveness to men</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">historically how do cosmetics for men</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">fit in here like war paint or</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">face paint interesting question so just</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">to frame it</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">the reference to an extended human</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">phenotype is a reference to an idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">first posited by dawkins in a book of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">the same name</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:49.680" style="s2">82 maybe it was a second book early 80s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">called the extended phenotype</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.680" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">uh in which he argued uh that for</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">instance the dam of a beaver</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">is part of its extended phenotype that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">is uh no</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">less the product of or you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">beaverish stuff than</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">the fur on the beaver or its heart um</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">and it was an it was an extension of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">model of how to understand the products</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">so our cosmetics and extended human</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">phenotype in that model for sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t say for sure really yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.760" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">because the implication of extended</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">phenotype</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">is that the genes are causing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">alteration</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">in the world and so you know oh i guess</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">okay so since you stricto dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">extended fian type sensu stricto not so</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">since ulato yeah so um you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:39.119" style="s2">the argument that dawkins and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">had yeah several octobers ago in chicago</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.119" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">was i argued that religion was extended</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.000" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">phenotype in other words that the genes</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">set this thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">in motion and that it was advancing</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">their interests which he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">agree with but um cosmetics</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">could be that and they are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">related in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">females are human females are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">ornamented sex and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">true physiologically but it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">at the level of adornment</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">you know um so uh with the exception of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">things like war paint</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">right like when we we see men um</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">decorating themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">in times of celebration in times of war</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">but the question is well and actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">and with with things not on their bodies</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">with ornaments like cars yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">question in this case</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">though is there&#39;s some tendency</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:31.760" style="s2">there physiologically females are</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">ornamented</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.760" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a tendency to behaviorally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">anatomically there&#39;s a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">augment that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.359" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">a cultural tendency a long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:41.599" style="s2">cultural tendency to augment that across</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">many cultures</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.599" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">right and then there&#39;s um you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">she&#39;s born with it maybe it&#39;s maybelline</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">bullshit which is really an economic</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">factor in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">the thing isn&#39;t driven by uh the women</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:56.079" style="s2">necessarily it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">in large measure driven by the profit</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.079" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">motive</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">of yeah people so often aren&#39;t women so</p>

<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">it and so you don&#39;t have a choice you</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">the question more broadly of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">why gender identity is replacing sex</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:53.119" style="s2">is exactly i think that&#39;s spot on in</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.119" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">the question that um why do we even call</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">it why do we call it gender dysphoria</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">this isn&#39;t gender dysphoria gender is</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">the behavioral manifestation of sex</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">in every other species gender exists</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">outside of humans it absolutely does</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">people who tell you it&#39;s a human</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">creation no they&#39;re wrong we call it sex</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">and it is the behavioral manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">that is typical for the sex that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">were born to</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">so gender dysphoria that&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">being a tomboy</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">but that&#39;s not what gender dysphoria</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">especially is understood by</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">uh you know by the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">therapeutic manuals</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">is understanding to be what what they</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:33.760" style="s2">really mean is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">sex dysphoria and calling it gender</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.760" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">dysphoria is part of the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">now add to that people with periods and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">pregnant people</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">and yeah this is this is gaslighting and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s regressive</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s misogynistic and it&#39;s nasty</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">and it all comes in this cloak of aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">we loving and inclusive and no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">so why does it make you so angry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">because you&#39;re being manipulated and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">you&#39;re being manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">by a threat and the problem is you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:07.520" style="s2">um megan murphy is no longer on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">because she insisted that men weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">women right</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">how dare she that&#39;s a measure of threat</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">and the idea of well</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">the idea that um some men have periods</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:45.760" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">this is designed to out you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.760" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">designed to get you</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">to either submit or to say something</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">categorize and stigmatize</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">well the point is look i don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">which thing you say right</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">at is</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">we are at the conversation that has no</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">right what what is the claim that some</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">men have periods</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">except for a delineator of whether</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">you are going to submit or</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">be hunted as a witch that&#39;s that&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">purpose is to get you to declare a side</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">its purpose is not to assert something</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:50.720" style="s2">factual which was is what it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">it is it&#39;s a factual claim that isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.720" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">factual claim</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">so that that&#39;s all true and that may be</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">that&#39;s at least one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">important pieces of it um but it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">having ramifications</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">in the real world on our young people</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">that is going to create um a significant</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">fraction of a whole generation that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">extraordinarily damaged i saw uh i saw a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">picture</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">protest presumably</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">you know one of the protests that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.240" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">happening right now that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.839" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">supposedly about</p>

<p begin="00:51:19.440" end="00:51:23.119" style="s2">the point is you send your kid to school</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.760" end="00:51:24.880" style="s2">and that puts you in the hand</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.119" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">puts the kid in the hands of somebody</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">and the fact is it&#39;s unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">and your family has the right to tell</p>

<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">that because he cannot possibly last</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">to be differently adaptive to novelty</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">this is a great question um long ago</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:54:58.400" style="s2">i was working on a project about</p>

<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">um but we have for instance talked about</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">what is the game called</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">llama among the maya um</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">who were before that maybe even the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">olmec um</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">had some version of it right yep so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">going to say something about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">yeah the mesoamerican ball game the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">llama is a very difficult game</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:40.880" style="s2">it still exists you will see on temples</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">very frequently a ring a small ring</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.880" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">sticking sideways off of a building on</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:49.040" style="s2">sides the court often has slanted sides</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">the idea was to get the ball through</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like basketball but you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re throwing right not no i</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:58.000" style="s2">think really</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">well the modern game of ulama involves</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.000" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">like hitting it with your</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">hip it&#39;s a really difficult oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">right it&#39;s more like soccer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">yeah yeah um but anyway let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">in general these games have to pay back</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.799" end="00:56:12.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of cost involved in</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">the case of ulama the cost</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.720" end="00:56:16.799" style="s2">as we understand it involves either the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">winners or the losers depends which</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.799" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">culture and at which moment in history</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">were put to death which is um you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">a lesson in perverse incentives at some</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.920" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a pretty a pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:31.920" style="s2">game there&#39;s also um</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">uh some interesting stuff that unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.920" end="00:56:35.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">i believe it&#39;s borneo there are some</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.280" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">you know where there&#39;s like an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">regress</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">uh revenge and so the idea is that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:51.280" style="s2">have to avenge the deaths</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">of people who were killed by the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.280" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely the case in papua new</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">guinea maybe this is pop one again i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">thinking about it or not</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">public is huge but in some of the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">right in papua new guinea</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.839" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a highly diverse island but yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">any case</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">the point is you only count the last</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">and so the point is you&#39;re always you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:11.839" style="s2">never even</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.160" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">because you&#39;re only counting the last</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.839" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">um but another place where we need a</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:18.480" style="s2">little bit of math well</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">no i&#39;m not so sure of that i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.480" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">if actually that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s terribly wasteful but</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">that this is a mechanism for making sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:30.160" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you just disengage and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">you stop making war on your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.160" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">right your enemy could get really strong</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">while you&#39;re not paying attention and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">the next time you make war they could</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:37.520" style="s2">obliterate you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">so what if you negotiated that you were</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.520" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">eliminating the last you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">eventually the last death so you were</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">always dead even</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">always either on active offense or</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">active defense</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">right as a at a village level or a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">population level right which would keep</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">two populations from ever getting out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">sync with each other i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">this is a more general problem any i</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">at all what&#39;s going on or even if i</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">necessarily have the setup correct but</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:04.960" style="s2">the point is games are complex</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:07.040" style="s2">they are expensive when you consider the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">massive investment of time and energy</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.040" end="00:58:10.960" style="s2">that is put into them</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">they persist over evolutionary time they</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.960" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">morph they&#39;re clearly adaptive so they</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:16.400" style="s2">have to be paid for by some</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:18.880" style="s2">some benefit that&#39;s even greater and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.400" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">surely in many cases it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.880" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">with uh keeping your skills sharp for</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">warfare getting a team of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:27.599" style="s2">to be able to understand what each other</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:30.960" style="s2">are going to do on a battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">um so no doubt all of those games any</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">persistent game</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">is going to have an adaptive explanation</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">and the question is are they all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">same probably not</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:41.200" style="s2">any of them are probably about war yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">but uh no and the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.200" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">you know the the militant moderate here</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.599" end="00:58:47.920" style="s2">who asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">specifies game not sport and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.920" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">sport obviously has element of game and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">games is</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">as i as i have defined it basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">sport absent the physical</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:59:01.280" style="s2">um so it is precisely potentially about</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">as the question asks providing practice</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.280" end="00:59:04.480" style="s2">for the part of the brain that contends</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:05.920" style="s2">with hypothetical situations</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.480" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">right and you know sport can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.920" end="00:59:08.960" style="s2">hypotheticals as well but they have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">be you know perfectly staged and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.960" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">choreographed whereas</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:14.559" style="s2">um the kinds of games that don&#39;t involve</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">actual physical negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.559" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">um are abstract in the head yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:24.799" style="s2">next question did dark skin originally</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">evolve for antimicrobial protection</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.799" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">rather than uv protection</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">does it get shed excuse me does it get</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">shed when pathogens are less abundant</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">for instance when populations move away</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:36.160" style="s2">from the tropics i heard trivers allude</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.160" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">for instance in africa some very</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:40.480" style="s2">dark-skinned ethnicities have</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">historically lived in the forest in</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">constant shade</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">thanks love you both so this from echo</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:52.480" style="s2">uh i have this sort of fig glimmering</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:53.359" style="s2">um of bob making this argument and i</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.480" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">have not gone</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.359" end="00:59:59.119" style="s2">i i can&#39;t recall um</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">i mean i i trust that echo is reporting</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.119" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">accurately what he has</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:06.319" style="s2">said and that he was accurate in</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">claiming</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.319" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">that within african populations some of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:12.400" style="s2">the most dark-skinned people are</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">actually understory dwellers</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.400" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">which would seem to suggest that there</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">is at least some other benefit</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.319" end="01:00:20.319" style="s2">uh to dark skin rather than uv</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">protection</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.319" end="01:00:24.079" style="s2">yeah um there was a lot of contingencies</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:26.559" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.079" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">yeah i have my my doubts about this and</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.559" end="01:00:31.040" style="s2">so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.760" end="01:00:32.720" style="s2">yes melanin has a cost to produce um</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.040" end="01:00:34.240" style="s2">so to the extent that that cost is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.720" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">being paid back you would expect it to</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.240" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">quickly reduced on the other hand it may</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">you know how long have these populations</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">lived that way and is the benefit</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">do they spend 100 of their time in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:52.319" style="s2">understory</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">is the benefit if they you know cross</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:55.760" style="s2">between patches of forest and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:58.079" style="s2">exposed to intense sunlight for</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.760" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">you know a small number of days a year</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.079" end="01:01:01.040" style="s2">would that justify the maintenance</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">because the real question is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.040" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">avoidance of damage</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.520" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know i think the fact that dark</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">skin is often</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">lightened in populations that have moved</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">from africa in particular is probably</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:18.640" style="s2">the result</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">of interbreeding um more than anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.640" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know what i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">is the microbial uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:29.119" style="s2">question it&#39;s not obvious yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">an alternative uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.119" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">alternative hypothesis for the benefit</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:34.000" style="s2">but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:36.160" style="s2">there&#39;s an implied mechanism there that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:37.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t spelled out sufficiently for us to</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.160" end="01:01:40.480" style="s2">assess right yeah did it evolve from</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.920" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">antimicrobial protection</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.480" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just trying to imagine how that</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">would work is it</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:48.960" style="s2">just simply a thermal question</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:50.400" style="s2">that because it&#39;s black it heats up</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.960" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">faster and it would</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.400" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">create an extreme environment is there</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">something about a topical fever</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:02:00.240" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:01.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a hypothesis anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:04.240" style="s2">hypothetical it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.119" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">hypothesis cova decide what is a model</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.240" end="01:02:08.160" style="s2">which we can improve our current</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">education system do you foresee ways of</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.160" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">receiving accreditation outside of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:14.319" style="s2">universities in the future</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">i love you too thanks um it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.319" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:22.559" style="s2">you know i i i was i should</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">i should dredge it up but i saw today uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.559" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">one of the most amazing rube goldberg</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">mechanisms i&#39;ve ever seen it was made</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">out of stuff that was clearly</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:34.960" style="s2">you know sourced at goodwill or</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">something it wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">a really refined one but it was</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:40.640" style="s2">elaborate it went all the way around</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:41.359" style="s2">this entire house and down into a forest</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.640" end="01:02:43.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.359" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">um anyway it was amazing and i was</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.359" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">thinking to myself</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">how smart would you end up if this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:50.880" style="s2">what you did</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:52.559" style="s2">instead of school you know because</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.880" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">basically there were you know dozens of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.559" end="01:02:55.359" style="s2">different mechanisms for getting things</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">to trigger other things</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.359" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">and you would learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">and there are of course things that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">would not learn that way that you would</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">want to supplement with maybe some other</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">but the point is you know i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:09.520" style="s2">whether we can rescue the system of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">education it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.520" end="01:03:13.359" style="s2">targeted at the wrong thing it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">not built to make you smarter</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.359" end="01:03:18.160" style="s2">and there are lots of things that do</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:18.960" style="s2">make you smarter and the question is can</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.160" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.960" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">uh find people who are capable of i</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">don&#39;t even want to say teaching because</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:26.960" style="s2">it may not be teaching</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:27.839" style="s2">but capable of facilitating learning and</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.960" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">teaching aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.839" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">the same thing they have they should</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">have considerable overlap</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:37.359" style="s2">but what you want is children</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:38.480" style="s2">and then adults who are know how to</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.359" end="01:03:40.960" style="s2">teach themselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.480" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">and who are excited about doing so right</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.960" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s not even two</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.079" end="01:03:47.280" style="s2">things it&#39;s like look you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:49.760" style="s2">here&#39;s an object you would like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.280" end="01:03:50.880" style="s2">produce here are the tools with which it</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.760" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">is produced</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.880" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">here are some instructions on how to use</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">those tools</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.880" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">do you have what it takes to get from</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:04:00.079" style="s2">the tools and the raw materials to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">object that you want to have produced</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">now it&#39;s exposing exposing children to</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:09.359" style="s2">uh that they might or might not yet have</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">the facility</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">and tools to solve across a wide variety</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:18.880" style="s2">of domains you know physical domains</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.520" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">out out in the woods inside in</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:23.599" style="s2">labs with words with math</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">all of these different domains many of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.599" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">which have been just excluded from</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.960" end="01:04:28.480" style="s2">school with</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:29.039" style="s2">music with sport all of these things you</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.480" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.039" end="01:04:34.799" style="s2">things like sport are often mocked</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:36.640" style="s2">for being in education at all and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.799" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">you know of course as soon as sports got</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.640" end="01:04:40.559" style="s2">sort of demoted then we started seeing</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">recess cut so now we&#39;ve got this just</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.559" end="01:04:45.599" style="s2">sort of brands and jars model now</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:47.920" style="s2">we need fully embodied kids who are</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.599" end="01:04:49.440" style="s2">excited to actually engage with whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.920" end="01:04:50.960" style="s2">it is that is being done</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">and same thing when you know arts</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.960" end="01:04:55.359" style="s2">programs are being cut well you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">is art as important as you know they</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.359" end="01:04:58.079" style="s2">learn to read</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.559" end="01:05:00.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know every kid needs to learn</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.079" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">how to read but um do they really</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.079" end="01:05:03.520" style="s2">need to learn how to spell at this point</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:05.599" style="s2">is that more important than</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.520" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">being with you know their classmates</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.599" end="01:05:08.960" style="s2">making music</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">every now and again or regularly i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.960" end="01:05:13.760" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:17.039" style="s2">well you know at the point you get to</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.760" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">their classes i just think</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.039" end="01:05:20.880" style="s2">the model is broken at the reason that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:23.520" style="s2">you should do</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.880" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">x is because we told you to and it will</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.520" end="01:05:26.079" style="s2">be bad for you not to and it&#39;ll be good</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:28.079" style="s2">for you to do it</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.079" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just a lousy motivational</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.079" end="01:05:31.039" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">and there are lots of good motivational</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.039" end="01:05:34.319" style="s2">structures where somebody actually feels</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:36.640" style="s2">good about accomplishing something</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.319" end="01:05:37.359" style="s2">for some reason other than you know the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.640" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">teacher</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.359" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">patted him on the head yeah hey buddy</p>

<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:03.520" style="s2">create economic collapses</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">or in my opinion covid social unrest and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.520" end="01:06:07.440" style="s2">recession</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:09.119" style="s2">will converge this winter yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.440" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">that&#39;s i think unfortunately not too</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.119" end="01:06:14.160" style="s2">risky a prediction</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">covid economic collapse and so uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.160" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">covid social unrest and recession uh</p>

<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">that 2015 marked the turning point for</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.760" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">campus protests</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:48.480" style="s2">was that your experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.720" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">so he his sort of two-pronged claim</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.400" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">as i remember it was that along with</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:07:01.359" style="s2">greg lukianov was that 2013 or so</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">is when people started to see uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.359" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">the beginnings of the unraveling of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:06.720" style="s2">population of people on campus and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">people were beginning to ask for trigger</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.720" end="01:07:10.640" style="s2">warnings</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">and safe spaces and things like that and</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.640" end="01:07:16.160" style="s2">then 2015</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:17.599" style="s2">is when uh the protests you know campus</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.160" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">much like apparently portland is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.599" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">protest city campuses are always protest</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.119" style="s2">places like protests will happen on</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">campuses every now and again</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.119" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">um but that the nature of them changed</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:29.039" style="s2">around 2015</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:31.200" style="s2">and you know i think anecdotally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.039" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">a that&#39;s a match for us but i think more</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.200" end="01:07:35.760" style="s2">interesting is sort of tracking back</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:37.599" style="s2">like what what all was in place and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.760" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">know and we&#39;ve i&#39;ve used this language</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.599" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">of a perfect storm</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">a lot um but you know broken k-12</p>

<p begin="01:07:50.000" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">make sure that they don&#39;t know how to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:53.680" style="s2">adults and putting them in screens all</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:56.079" style="s2">day long</p>

<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">of course they are yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.520" end="01:08:05.839" style="s2">to know for one thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.480" style="s2">um we only had access to one college</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.839" end="01:08:09.280" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.480" end="01:08:10.319" style="s2">yeah and what we saw was very atypical</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.280" end="01:08:13.839" style="s2">because of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.319" end="01:08:16.560" style="s2">our very vibrant and um</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.839" end="01:08:17.440" style="s2">non-crazy community which was composed</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.560" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">of a bunch of stars</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.440" end="01:08:19.920" style="s2">our particular students because</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:21.520" style="s2">obviously there were parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.920" end="01:08:23.359" style="s2">evergreen community that were</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.520" end="01:08:25.040" style="s2">quite crazy clearly and there were</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.359" end="01:08:27.839" style="s2">clearly things being taught in</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.040" end="01:08:28.719" style="s2">some quadrants of the campus uh that</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.839" end="01:08:31.359" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.719" end="01:08:32.239" style="s2">nonsense and metastasized yeah worse</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.359" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">than nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.239" end="01:08:38.560" style="s2">uh pernicious yeah malignant nonsense um</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s a little hard to say but uh i</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.560" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">think he</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:44.080" style="s2">uh he and lukiana for in the ballpark</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:47.679" style="s2">with respect to the tipping point yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.080" end="01:08:49.440" style="s2">absolutely many youtubers generate</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:51.279" style="s2">income from live in-person events with</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.440" end="01:08:52.640" style="s2">fans such as golf tournaments etc</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.279" end="01:08:54.159" style="s2">have you considered leading a hike for</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.640" end="01:08:55.839" style="s2">patrons who donate significantly or</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.159" end="01:08:59.040" style="s2">something similar</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.839" end="01:09:02.480" style="s2">yeah we have we&#39;ve talked about leading</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.040" end="01:09:06.319" style="s2">what we were calling evolution weekends</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.480" end="01:09:07.440" style="s2">in and around portland uh and we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.319" end="01:09:10.159" style="s2">talked about leading</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.440" end="01:09:11.040" style="s2">uh trips farther afield to places like</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.159" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">tippatini</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.040" end="01:09:18.000" style="s2">in the ecuador and amazon um you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">maybe maybe at some point it can be very</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.000" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">stimulating to have a discussion about</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:24.159" style="s2">evolution while looking at monkeys</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">yes yes especially if they are squirrel</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.159" end="01:09:28.560" style="s2">monkeys or marmosets</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:29.520" style="s2">or td monkeys or okay all of them don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.560" end="01:09:31.600" style="s2">mean night monkeys</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.520" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">yeah heller monkey&#39;s not as interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.600" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">yeah but they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:37.600" style="s2">but yeah um it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.839" end="01:09:38.880" style="s2">weird to me that we have a cat right in</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.600" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">front of us and that they can&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.880" end="01:09:42.159" style="s2">cat</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:43.679" style="s2">oh no you know they can see his ear yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.159" end="01:09:45.120" style="s2">what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.679" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">a little bit on screen yeah okay two</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.120" end="01:09:49.759" style="s2">more questions for today uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.080" end="01:09:51.520" style="s2">i have a theory that mask wearing is</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.759" end="01:09:53.440" style="s2">more accepted in asian countries</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.520" end="01:09:54.640" style="s2">partly because they look for emotions in</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.440" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">the eyes</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.640" end="01:09:59.520" style="s2">what do you think i think we all look</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.360" end="01:10:02.239" style="s2">for emotions in the eyes</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:03.360" style="s2">don&#39;t we do you so the the question i</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.239" end="01:10:06.400" style="s2">think presumes</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.360" end="01:10:08.080" style="s2">that asian cultures are more prone to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.400" end="01:10:11.360" style="s2">looking for emotion in the eyes</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.080" end="01:10:13.199" style="s2">and you know maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.360" end="01:10:15.440" style="s2">therefore that they are less likely to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.199" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">show emotion than the rest of their face</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.440" end="01:10:18.880" style="s2">such that covering the rest of the face</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:21.679" style="s2">is less of a hit</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.880" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">sort of emotionally and cognitively for</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.679" end="01:10:26.400" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">well all it has to be is more</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.400" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">in order for this to make sense um but</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">it raises a deeper question</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:36.239" style="s2">let&#39;s say for example or uh for the sake</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:38.719" style="s2">of argument that</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">this is correct and that asians</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.719" end="01:10:42.080" style="s2">typically</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:44.320" style="s2">uh do read more emotion in the eyes is</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.080" end="01:10:47.280" style="s2">that because there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.320" end="01:10:49.280" style="s2">asians that is genomically prone to this</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.280" end="01:10:51.760" style="s2">or is that because</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.280" end="01:10:52.560" style="s2">emotionality is conveyed in the eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.760" end="01:10:54.159" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.560" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">in the same way that we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.159" end="01:10:57.040" style="s2">tonal language and have a hard time</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:10:59.360" style="s2">learning one</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.040" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">do they learn to convey emotions with</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.360" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">the eyes in ways that people from</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:05.199" style="s2">cultures that don&#39;t do this don&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:08.960" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.199" end="01:11:10.719" style="s2">uh they are predisposed</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.960" end="01:11:12.080" style="s2">i guess what i would say so it&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.719" end="01:11:12.960" style="s2">it you&#39;re saying if if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.080" end="01:11:15.600" style="s2">correlation</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.960" end="01:11:16.880" style="s2">you might you might uh your default</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.600" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">assumption would be the cause and effect</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.880" end="01:11:20.800" style="s2">of reversed from</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">what the question is supposing well i</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.800" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say cause and effect reversed i</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:24.560" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:26.800" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s some arbitrary reason</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.560" end="01:11:28.719" style="s2">emotion gets conveyed in every culture</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.800" end="01:11:30.320" style="s2">it may be conveyed on different channels</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.719" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">it may be that asian cultures convey it</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.320" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">more in the eyes i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:35.520" style="s2">true but let&#39;s say it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.760" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">and then covid comes along and it just</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:39.199" style="s2">interfaces with this arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">cover your mouth cover your mouth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.199" end="01:11:44.080" style="s2">your nose we could do that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.960" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">um then uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.080" end="01:11:48.400" style="s2">it would be less disruptive so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:50.400" style="s2">it&#39;s plausible</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.400" end="01:11:51.760" style="s2">but i&#39;d be i&#39;d be really curious a</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.400" end="01:11:53.679" style="s2">whether the claim is right and</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.760" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">the observation has to be true and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.679" end="01:11:56.719" style="s2">we can talk about whether or not the</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">hypothesis that would explain the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:01.440" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">might be true yeah yeah final question</p>

<p begin="01:12:05.040" end="01:12:07.679" style="s2">do you ever find yourself holding back</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.480" end="01:12:10.000" style="s2">from adventures because it would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.679" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">unsafe for a woman</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.000" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">so this is there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:16.560" style="s2">said here</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.120" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">and um you know i have enjoyed traveling</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.560" end="01:12:20.800" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:22.800" style="s2">a lot and it is risky and you do take on</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.800" end="01:12:25.760" style="s2">risk by doing so</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.800" end="01:12:26.400" style="s2">but you also end up in situations that</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.760" end="01:12:29.679" style="s2">are good</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.400" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">that you cannot end up in if you are</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.679" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">are with someone so</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:36.480" style="s2">holding back on adventures because would</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">be unsafe i&#39;m sure i&#39;ve made those</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.480" end="01:12:41.600" style="s2">decisions i mean i think you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:43.440" style="s2">you&#39;d be a fool to not recognize um that</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.600" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">you know as as a woman traveling alone</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.440" end="01:12:46.640" style="s2">there are particular risks</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:48.159" style="s2">um that you are taking that are unlike</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.640" end="01:12:49.600" style="s2">the risks that you would be taking if</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.159" end="01:12:50.800" style="s2">you were a man traveling alone</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.600" end="01:12:54.880" style="s2">and so you have to make different</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.800" end="01:12:54.880" style="s2">decisions sometimes but um</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:13:01.040" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve i was gonna i guess the</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.880" end="01:13:02.640" style="s2">story i was just about to</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.040" end="01:13:03.920" style="s2">tell hasn&#39;t been told publicly so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.640" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">not gonna say it yet we&#39;ve written it</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.920" end="01:13:07.360" style="s2">into the book so i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.840" end="01:13:10.719" style="s2">share that one here we&#39;ve definitely</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.360" end="01:13:10.719" style="s2">when we&#39;ve been traveling together</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.800" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">we have run into situations where i was</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.040" end="01:13:18.960" style="s2">incredibly grateful that we were</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:21.199" style="s2">together and that i wasn&#39;t alone but i</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.960" end="01:13:23.120" style="s2">i always have to wonder what would i</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.199" end="01:13:25.440" style="s2">have done differently in the run-up</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.120" end="01:13:26.640" style="s2">you know i have been that combination of</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.440" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">lucky and smart</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.640" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">and i have i have not i have not been</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">hurt um</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:34.239" style="s2">in any of these situations in any in any</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">real way</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.239" end="01:13:38.800" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t you can&#39;t just be smart</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:41.120" style="s2">and you certainly can&#39;t just be lucky</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.800" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">because you can&#39;t depend on luck and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.120" end="01:13:45.760" style="s2">there is no guarantee</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:47.679" style="s2">but you do have to decide in advance</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">what your tolerance</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.679" end="01:13:53.760" style="s2">is and also get a real sense of what the</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">background culture</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.760" end="01:13:58.000" style="s2">is um you know for instance it was</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:13:58.880" style="s2">advised when we started working in latin</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.000" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">america and</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.880" end="01:14:01.760" style="s2">a couple of seasons we were in different</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:02.560" style="s2">parts of latin america we were both down</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.760" end="01:14:04.480" style="s2">there at the same time we were in</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.560" end="01:14:07.120" style="s2">different countries sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.480" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">um when we were in grad school you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.120" end="01:14:09.679" style="s2">with the this is before we were married</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.480" end="01:14:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s oh you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.679" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">you know women should wear a wedding</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.960" end="01:14:13.600" style="s2">band whether or not they&#39;re married like</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">just you know because it helps</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.600" end="01:14:17.840" style="s2">it helps fend off unwanted attention</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:19.600" style="s2">well that fends off unwanted attention</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.840" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">exactly as long as the person can ask</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.600" end="01:14:22.640" style="s2">the question well he&#39;s not here is he so</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:24.400" style="s2">you need a boyfriend right</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.640" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">so it does it doesn&#39;t actually work like</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.400" end="01:14:28.719" style="s2">none of these simple signals</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:29.360" style="s2">actually do the trick um you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.719" end="01:14:32.080" style="s2">prepared</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.360" end="01:14:32.880" style="s2">actively to defend yourself and to move</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.080" end="01:14:35.600" style="s2">out of a cond</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.880" end="01:14:37.280" style="s2">out of a situation if if it&#39;s not if</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.600" end="01:14:38.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not safe and you i did have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.280" end="01:14:40.560" style="s2">change where</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">i was actually based um a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.560" end="01:14:46.960" style="s2">times when i was doing field work alone</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:48.960" style="s2">in costa rica um because um the</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.960" end="01:14:51.199" style="s2">the dude who owned the place where i was</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.960" end="01:14:53.120" style="s2">staying proved not to be trustworthy</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.199" end="01:14:54.719" style="s2">and like i said i never got hurt never</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.120" end="01:14:56.560" style="s2">got hands on me but it could have well</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.719" end="01:14:59.280" style="s2">ended up differently if i had not</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.560" end="01:15:00.400" style="s2">taken the sort of spidey sense i was</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.280" end="01:15:03.679" style="s2">getting and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.400" end="01:15:07.040" style="s2">some some more clear indicators</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.679" end="01:15:09.600" style="s2">seriously so um</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.040" end="01:15:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be context specific but</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.600" end="01:15:14.000" style="s2">the idea that um</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.360" end="01:15:15.760" style="s2">you know not you know being gender</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.000" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">non-conforming and being sort of you</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.760" end="01:15:18.719" style="s2">know a badass and</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:20.400" style="s2">carrying a machete around like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.719" end="01:15:21.840" style="s2">not sufficient you know if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.400" end="01:15:23.360" style="s2">woman it&#39;s just different you just have</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.840" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">different risks</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.360" end="01:15:30.159" style="s2">than if you&#39;re a man with all risk it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:33.199" style="s2">important um that you</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.159" end="01:15:34.239" style="s2">we have a thing shorthand is the theory</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.199" end="01:15:37.840" style="s2">of close calls</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.239" end="01:15:38.719" style="s2">which is as you engage in something</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.840" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.719" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">things tend to go wrong slightly before</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:44.239" style="s2">they go severely wrong and if you regard</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:45.840" style="s2">the fact that they didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.239" end="01:15:47.040" style="s2">catastrophically wrong as evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.840" end="01:15:48.320" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something right you will</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.040" end="01:15:49.679" style="s2">end up with them ultimately going</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.320" end="01:15:52.640" style="s2">catastrophically wrong</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.679" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">and if you take the data that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.640" end="01:15:55.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:57.360" style="s2">near misses and things as evidence of</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.840" end="01:15:58.400" style="s2">what you might change then you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:00.320" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.400" end="01:16:02.000" style="s2">discover where the hazards are and how</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.320" end="01:16:03.199" style="s2">to avoid them so yeah it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.000" end="01:16:03.600" style="s2">interesting that you raised that here</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.199" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.600" end="01:16:06.239" style="s2">we&#39;ve obviously we&#39;ve talked about that</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">a lot we&#39;ve talked about with our kids a</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.239" end="01:16:09.520" style="s2">lot this theory of close calls</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.840" end="01:16:11.440" style="s2">and i&#39;ve always thought of it with</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.520" end="01:16:14.159" style="s2">regard to the abiotic stuff</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.440" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">right with regard to the the waves and</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.159" end="01:16:18.159" style="s2">the tree falls</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:20.880" style="s2">and the rising water and the rivers and</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.159" end="01:16:21.520" style="s2">you know these these things that happen</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.880" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.520" end="01:16:25.679" style="s2">respond in no way depending on how you</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:27.520" style="s2">respond to them right like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.679" end="01:16:28.080" style="s2">they don&#39;t change their behavior because</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.520" end="01:16:30.400" style="s2">you were</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.080" end="01:16:31.360" style="s2">fierce or careful or smart or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.400" end="01:16:33.600" style="s2">you just have to have been</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.360" end="01:16:35.199" style="s2">out of the way or be able to get out of</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.600" end="01:16:38.800" style="s2">the way as it happens</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.199" end="01:16:42.080" style="s2">in a social situation is different</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.800" end="01:16:45.280" style="s2">right um and uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.080" end="01:16:48.719" style="s2">you can learn the sort of categories of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.280" end="01:16:51.760" style="s2">people you know the vast majority of um</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.719" end="01:16:53.120" style="s2">you know walking down a street in some</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.760" end="01:16:55.440" style="s2">latin american capital</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.120" end="01:16:57.120" style="s2">and getting a lot of attention from men</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.440" end="01:16:58.560" style="s2">the vast majority of them have no</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.120" end="01:17:00.080" style="s2">intention of doing anything more than</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.560" end="01:17:02.080" style="s2">that how do you figure out</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.080" end="01:17:04.000" style="s2">who the tiny percentage of people who</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.080" end="01:17:05.120" style="s2">would and making sure that you never end</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:08.239" style="s2">up alone</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.120" end="01:17:10.400" style="s2">um in a dark alley with such people um</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.239" end="01:17:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t necessarily track you</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.400" end="01:17:15.520" style="s2">that lesson doesn&#39;t necessarily track to</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.280" end="01:17:16.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re in egypt or if you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.520" end="01:17:18.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re in some other place in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.640" end="01:17:21.040" style="s2">world with very different cultural norms</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.400" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">around behavior between the sexes those</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.040" end="01:17:23.920" style="s2">are two different things though</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:25.440" style="s2">i agree that the lessons of latin</p>

<p begin="01:17:25.440" end="01:17:31.440" style="s2">translate to the middle east but um</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.040" end="01:17:33.520" style="s2">the theory of close calls still works</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.440" end="01:17:35.440" style="s2">you know and you can even detect</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.520" end="01:17:36.640" style="s2">you know there may be parts of town</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.440" end="01:17:38.880" style="s2">where you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.640" end="01:17:40.480" style="s2">safe and you don&#39;t know them and the</p>

<p begin="01:17:43.360" end="01:17:47.360" style="s2">move in this direction goes up</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:48.880" style="s2">is one of these things where you will</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.360" end="01:17:50.560" style="s2">attack you will be uncomfortable before</p>

<p begin="01:17:50.560" end="01:17:54.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s not to say that you know you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.159" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">always encounter the thing that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.400" end="01:17:58.880" style="s2">kill you on the first go just out of</p>

<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:03.040" style="s2">you do tend to get indicators before you</p>

<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:06.960" style="s2">that&#39;s crippling and well and this</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.520" end="01:18:08.480" style="s2">actually maybe this is this is part of</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.960" end="01:18:09.520" style="s2">it i mean i assume the way that this</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.480" end="01:18:11.120" style="s2">question is asked and the fact that</p>

<p begin="01:18:11.120" end="01:18:13.600" style="s2">assume that they already know this but</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:15.600" style="s2">one of the things that is so</p>

<p begin="01:18:17.679" end="01:18:21.520" style="s2">and such</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.560" end="01:18:23.120" style="s2">is this assumption that um the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.520" end="01:18:24.159" style="s2">women are more at risk if they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:18:27.199" end="01:18:31.280" style="s2">and we object to that right and like you</p>

<p begin="01:18:31.280" end="01:18:35.679" style="s2">that is just true and i&#39;m not justifying</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.800" end="01:18:37.199" style="s2">the fact you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.679" end="01:18:39.040" style="s2">you said when we were on rogan together</p>

<p begin="01:18:39.040" end="01:18:43.600" style="s2">sure it would be great if you could ride</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.360" end="01:18:45.600" style="s2">naked down you know down the street</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.600" end="01:18:47.679" style="s2">um as a woman but you can&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.600" end="01:18:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not the world we live in</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.679" end="01:18:50.719" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it would be great we</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.360" end="01:18:53.679" style="s2">should live in a world so</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.719" end="01:18:55.360" style="s2">safe that you&#39;re walking through the</p>

<p begin="01:18:58.400" end="01:19:02.400" style="s2">and naked is not taken as consent by</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.640" end="01:19:04.239" style="s2">anybody right but you&#39;d be a fool to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.400" end="01:19:07.280" style="s2">it you&#39;d be a fool to do it</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.239" end="01:19:10.320" style="s2">and excuse me</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.280" end="01:19:13.440" style="s2">um recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.320" end="01:19:14.719" style="s2">keeping keeping hyper aware of your</p>

<p begin="01:19:23.120" end="01:19:26.480" style="s2">and obviously that&#39;s different if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.560" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">in a public place that you know where</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.480" end="01:19:29.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of you know at</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.600" end="01:19:31.120" style="s2">a club for instance versus walking away</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.600" end="01:19:32.320" style="s2">from the club back home</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.120" end="01:19:34.080" style="s2">on streets that are increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.320" end="01:19:35.760" style="s2">deserted but it&#39;s neighborhoods you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.080" end="01:19:38.800" style="s2">and therefore you have some sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.760" end="01:19:40.080" style="s2">versus leaving such a place in a city</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.800" end="01:19:41.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re visiting you don&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="01:19:41.600" end="01:19:45.840" style="s2">airbnb or a hotel these are three very</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.080" end="01:19:48.080" style="s2">different situations and in each case</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.840" end="01:19:50.960" style="s2">what you need to do is have a model of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.080" end="01:19:51.280" style="s2">how the world responds to you especially</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.960" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.280" end="01:19:54.800" style="s2">the scene in which you&#39;re in you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:56.640" style="s2">how you&#39;re dressed and how you are</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.800" end="01:19:58.159" style="s2">presenting and what time of night it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.640" end="01:19:59.840" style="s2">whether or not you have any friends with</p>

<p begin="01:19:59.840" end="01:20:04.640" style="s2">not being outraged the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.679" end="01:20:07.920" style="s2">world may do something horrifying to you</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.640" end="01:20:09.679" style="s2">even though that is awful but actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.920" end="01:20:11.520" style="s2">taking as much responsibility as you can</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.679" end="01:20:13.120" style="s2">to make sure that you reduce the chances</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.520" end="01:20:13.679" style="s2">that something horrible happens to you</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.120" end="01:20:16.719" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.679" end="01:20:17.199" style="s2">is not in any way victim blaming it is</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.719" end="01:20:19.920" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.199" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">okay now you&#39;re taking as much</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.920" end="01:20:26.000" style="s2">responsibility as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:27.199" style="s2">for the un for the inequitable outcomes</p>

<p begin="01:20:27.199" end="01:20:30.719" style="s2">that result from being a woman versus</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.880" end="01:20:32.480" style="s2">being a man wandering alone</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.719" end="01:20:34.080" style="s2">you know late at night or in some just</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.480" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">deserted place because you traveled</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.080" end="01:20:37.440" style="s2">somewhere alone</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:38.719" style="s2">it actually strikes me that it is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.440" end="01:20:42.159" style="s2">perfect analog</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.719" end="01:20:44.000" style="s2">for the general conflict between</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.159" end="01:20:45.280" style="s2">the personal responsibility side which</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.000" end="01:20:46.000" style="s2">conservatives tend to see and the</p>

<p begin="01:20:50.560" end="01:20:55.440" style="s2">let&#39;s say for example that you turn out</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.520" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">to be a woman</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.440" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">as i did yes quite and for this i am</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:03.360" style="s2">grateful as well but</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:04.480" style="s2">you&#39;re a woman you</p>

<p begin="01:21:04.480" end="01:21:08.239" style="s2">face two things one is the question of</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.040" end="01:21:10.639" style="s2">how you will</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.239" end="01:21:12.080" style="s2">walk through the world and the other is</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.639" end="01:21:14.560" style="s2">whether the world</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:16.320" style="s2">requires things of you that it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.560" end="01:21:18.719" style="s2">right should you be safe</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.320" end="01:21:20.719" style="s2">in any city in the world dressed however</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.719" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">you feel like being dressed</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.719" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">at all times of day and night yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.239" end="01:21:28.320" style="s2">we should want that world right but you</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">don&#39;t live in that world so should you</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.320" end="01:21:32.320" style="s2">say well it&#39;s not my responsibility to</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:34.800" style="s2">make me safe society</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.320" end="01:21:36.480" style="s2">should make me safe we all agree to that</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.800" end="01:21:38.159" style="s2">so therefore i&#39;m going to address</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.480" end="01:21:39.840" style="s2">however i will dress i&#39;m going to ignore</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.159" end="01:21:41.120" style="s2">what time of day it is what part of town</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:42.159" style="s2">i&#39;m in etc etc</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.120" end="01:21:44.880" style="s2">and if something happens that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.159" end="01:21:47.840" style="s2">civilization&#39;s fault well</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.880" end="01:21:48.560" style="s2">no the point is let&#39;s say that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.840" end="01:21:51.280" style="s2">invest</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.560" end="01:21:52.719" style="s2">in the societal responsibility side how</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.280" end="01:21:54.320" style="s2">much are you likely to make yourself</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.719" end="01:21:56.239" style="s2">safer</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.320" end="01:21:57.760" style="s2">almost none so if you say well anything</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.239" end="01:21:59.280" style="s2">you say about how i might be dressed in</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.760" end="01:22:01.679" style="s2">what part of town and all that</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.280" end="01:22:02.880" style="s2">is you victim blaming then you are</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.679" end="01:22:06.239" style="s2">making yourself</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.880" end="01:22:06.960" style="s2">uh vulnerable whereas if you invested</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.239" end="01:22:09.040" style="s2">entirely</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.960" end="01:22:11.199" style="s2">in the personal responsibility side you</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.040" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">have a huge impact on how much danger</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.199" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:15.600" style="s2">and so the point is both things are true</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:19.360" style="s2">yeah right both things are true</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.600" end="01:22:20.239" style="s2">no i yeah i have maybe this is the place</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.360" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">to end</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.239" end="01:22:23.440" style="s2">this is an anecdote but i have this</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:26.000" style="s2">memory uh from</p>

<p begin="01:22:43.440" end="01:22:46.400" style="s2">friday and saturday nights</p>

<p begin="01:22:59.199" end="01:23:03.040" style="s2">about seeing all of these smith women</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.199" end="01:23:06.560" style="s2">who were so vocal about their</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.040" end="01:23:08.159" style="s2">feminist um feelings and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.560" end="01:23:10.800" style="s2">dolling themselves up and teetering</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.159" end="01:23:13.840" style="s2">around in heels which are inherently</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.800" end="01:23:15.920" style="s2">um you know not good shoes</p>

<p begin="01:23:49.760" end="01:23:53.440" style="s2">late at night on a friday or saturday</p>

<p begin="01:23:58.239" end="01:24:00.880" style="s2">i&#39;m a woman too but i&#39;m not dressed like</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.600" end="01:24:01.600" style="s2">that and i&#39;m not drunk and i could</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.880" end="01:24:04.320" style="s2">potentially</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.600" end="01:24:05.280" style="s2">help her get wherever she&#39;s going and i</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.320" end="01:24:06.719" style="s2">did end up like</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.280" end="01:24:09.280" style="s2">seeing her get into a building but my</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.719" end="01:24:11.199" style="s2">thought was for god&#39;s sake like</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.280" end="01:24:12.560" style="s2">this is what friends are for for one</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.199" end="01:24:14.080" style="s2">thing like she never should have been</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.560" end="01:24:16.400" style="s2">alone in that situation</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.080" end="01:24:17.360" style="s2">but god forbid something had happened to</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.400" end="01:24:18.800" style="s2">her</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.360" end="01:24:21.040" style="s2">no nothing ever should have happened to</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.800" end="01:24:24.480" style="s2">her but the combination of being</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.040" end="01:24:26.320" style="s2">alone at night drunk in shoes that would</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.480" end="01:24:27.199" style="s2">never have allowed her to make a fast</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.320" end="01:24:28.960" style="s2">getaway</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.199" end="01:24:30.639" style="s2">all would have contributed to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.960" end="01:24:32.159" style="s2">that she would have been hurt and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.639" end="01:24:34.159" style="s2">so grateful that i didn&#39;t see this woman</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.159" end="01:24:36.960" style="s2">get hurt but that scene is just</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.159" end="01:24:38.719" style="s2">emblazoned in my memory as like that is</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.960" end="01:24:39.679" style="s2">someone who is not taking the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.719" end="01:24:42.000" style="s2">care of herself</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.679" end="01:24:43.199" style="s2">as she should be and so like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.000" end="01:24:45.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.199" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re traveling right that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.280" end="01:24:48.000" style="s2">know you</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:50.080" style="s2">you just don&#39;t put yourself in that</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.000" end="01:24:50.880" style="s2">situation yeah if you just simply</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.080" end="01:24:54.159" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.880" end="01:24:54.880" style="s2">um predators exist and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.159" end="01:24:56.960" style="s2">we can do</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.880" end="01:24:58.320" style="s2">to eliminate them 100 we should do</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.960" end="01:25:00.159" style="s2">better than we do but</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.320" end="01:25:01.679" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be predatory men and</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.159" end="01:25:04.719" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.679" end="01:25:07.360" style="s2">uh you know the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.719" end="01:25:08.560" style="s2">the deer with the limp exactly because</p>

<p begin="01:25:08.560" end="01:25:12.960" style="s2">vulnerable individual so</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.400" end="01:25:13.600" style="s2">you know allowing yourself to be that is</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.960" end="01:25:16.159" style="s2">uh</p>
