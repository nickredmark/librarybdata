<p begin="00:00:28.920" end="00:00:37.530" style="s2">thank you thank you very much it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:42.510" style="s2">nice to be here and to see you all come</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.530" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">out to spend a couple of hours thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.510" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">about difficult things there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">an appetite for that which is really</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:01:01.800" style="s2">so let&#39;s exploit it so I started working</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">on the ideas that I outlined in 12 rules</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.800" end="00:01:10.440" style="s2">for life well a long time ago and really</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">started when I was about 13 I was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.440" end="00:01:17.090" style="s2">junior high school student and I met</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:19.649" style="s2">this librarian who&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.090" end="00:01:26.310" style="s2">eccentric person very well-educated</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.649" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">person and she we I used to hang around</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.310" end="00:01:29.910" style="s2">with my delinquent friends in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">library which tells you how eccentric</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.910" end="00:01:34.979" style="s2">the librarian was because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.860" style="s2">normally the place where the delinquent</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.979" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">kids hang out you know but she talked to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:43.400" style="s2">us like we were adults and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">word what would you call it a refreshing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.400" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">that was a refreshing experience and she</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:56.390" style="s2">knew that I&#39;d like to read and she</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:58.470" style="s2">started giving me real books she gave me</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.390" end="00:02:01.610" style="s2">one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.470" end="00:02:03.900" style="s2">which was the first book published by</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.610" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.900" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">Union it&#39;s a story about the day of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:13.799" style="s2">political prisoner in a in a work camp</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:16.620" style="s2">and brave new world and 1984 an animal</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.799" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">farm and in rands books which was quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.620" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">interesting because she was the wife of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">our Member of Parliament who was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:27.329" style="s2">only member of the Opposition in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">province and he was a socialist an NDP</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.329" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">new democratic party leader as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:35.160" style="s2">of fact and but despite that she gave me</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">an rands books because she thought that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.160" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">I should be exposed to the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:42.330" style="s2">the argument so I read Atlas Shrugged</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:46.890" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.330" end="00:02:50.120" style="s2">The Fountainhead and well she was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.890" end="00:02:55.110" style="s2">first person who helped me discover</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">literature let&#39;s say and well at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.110" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">same time I got interested in what had</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">happened in Nazi Germany and I wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">essay about that when I was about 13 or</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:08.490" style="s2">14 about Auschwitz and what had happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:11.550" style="s2">there and I never read that really never</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.490" end="00:03:13.110" style="s2">left my mind I would say I think I read</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.550" end="00:03:15.390" style="s2">Victor Frankel&#39;s man&#39;s search for</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.110" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">meaning at that point which is a book I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">would highly recommend I have a reading</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:21.600" style="s2">list on my website by the way at Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:23.010" style="s2">B Peterson com and so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.600" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">variety of books there that have really</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.010" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">influenced me and and I put them up for</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">other people&#39;s use anyways I never what</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">what I learned about our Woodson about</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:38.880" style="s2">Nazi Germany never really left my mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:41.310" style="s2">and because I couldn&#39;t understand how</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.880" end="00:03:44.010" style="s2">people could act that way how they could</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.310" end="00:03:46.680" style="s2">not only be possessed by an ideology to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.010" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">the degree that the Germans were a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.680" end="00:03:50.910" style="s2">civilized country Germany you know so</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2">was I suppose even a more spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.910" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">shock that something so catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:03:57.150" style="s2">happened there there wasn&#39;t just the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:03:59.700" style="s2">ideological possession it was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.150" end="00:04:00.840" style="s2">cruelty and the gratuitous cruelty in</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.700" end="00:04:02.910" style="s2">the service of that ideological</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.840" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">possession that I couldn&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.910" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t establish a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:12.590" style="s2">between my own being and and those</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">patterns of action and as I got older</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.590" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">that concern transformed itself into an</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">obsession I would say not so much with</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:25.200" style="s2">what had happened in Nazi Germany but</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.730" style="s2">with I think what happened what was</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.200" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">happening as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.730" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2">collectivist philosophy per se which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:35.220" style="s2">might think of something that manifested</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.370" end="00:04:37.550" style="s2">itself both on the right in Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:41.070" style="s2">and then on the left in all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.550" end="00:04:44.280" style="s2">multitudinous and catastrophic communist</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.070" end="00:04:47.100" style="s2">regimes that characterized the bulk of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.280" end="00:04:48.870" style="s2">the 20th century and they&#39;re insane</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.100" end="00:04:52.680" style="s2">murderous Ness and that probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.870" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">culminated for me in the 1970s when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.680" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">read Alexander Solzhenitsyn &#39;s Gulag</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:04:59.340" style="s2">Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">go which is another book that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.340" end="00:05:03.540" style="s2">should read because in some sense it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:06.480" style="s2">might be the defining document of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.540" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">20th century and the fact that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.480" end="00:05:10.950" style="s2">in the West isn&#39;t familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">book is actually a signal of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.950" end="00:05:18.450" style="s2">catastrophic moral failing I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">started writing this book called maps of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.450" end="00:05:23.639" style="s2">meaning in about 1985 although I had</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">been working on variants of it before</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.639" end="00:05:33.540" style="s2">that and what I was trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:37.430" style="s2">was maybe the psychological motivations</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.540" end="00:05:39.270" style="s2">for the Cold War something like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.430" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">many of you are old enough to remember</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.270" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">what it was like in the 1980s we just</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:47.160" style="s2">went and visited the house in in wreck</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:49.350" style="s2">javac where Gorbachev and Reagan met</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.160" end="00:05:50.610" style="s2">which was quite something to see and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.350" end="00:05:53.250" style="s2">when they decided they were going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.610" end="00:05:54.330" style="s2">bring at least some of the insanity to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:56.389" style="s2">relative halt</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.330" end="00:05:58.919" style="s2">thank God the eighties were a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.389" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">contentious time you know the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.919" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">sort of peeked into at two times the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">peaked in 1962 during the Cuban Missile</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:10.410" style="s2">Crisis I don&#39;t know if you know this but</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">I was visited a nuclear missile site in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.410" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">in Arizona about ten years ago it was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">decommissioned missile site</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:20.250" style="s2">intercontinental ballistic missile</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:22.200" style="s2">intercontinental ballistic missile is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.250" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">very large rockets and can go halfway</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.200" end="00:06:26.640" style="s2">around the world and it&#39;s ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:28.380" style="s2">which means it has the same function as</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.640" end="00:06:30.810" style="s2">a bullet and the bullet is ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.380" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">because once you fire it it&#39;s gone you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.810" end="00:06:35.669" style="s2">don&#39;t control it after it it leaves so</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">once you launch a ballistic missile it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.669" end="00:06:39.750" style="s2">launched there&#39;s no calling it back and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:42.570" style="s2">they told us they did a simulation</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:44.820" style="s2">launch which is very eerie thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.570" end="00:06:46.860" style="s2">to launch a nuclear missile is a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.820" end="00:06:53.220" style="s2">console that sort of looks like the Star</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.860" end="00:06:56.220" style="s2">Trek control control module let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.220" end="00:06:58.919" style="s2">and one person stands here and one</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.220" end="00:07:00.780" style="s2">person stands about 20 feet away each</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.919" end="00:07:03.270" style="s2">have a key around their neck and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.780" end="00:07:05.820" style="s2">put the key in the lock simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.270" end="00:07:07.380" style="s2">and then turn it for ten seconds and at</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.820" end="00:07:09.300" style="s2">the end of ten seconds the missile is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.380" end="00:07:11.370" style="s2">gone and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.300" end="00:07:15.210" style="s2">and they both have their keys in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.370" end="00:07:17.310" style="s2">lock in 1962 so and we came close again</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.210" end="00:07:21.180" style="s2">in 1984 when I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.310" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">this but a Soviet missile detection</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:26.130" style="s2">system signaled the launch of four or</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:30.030" style="s2">five missiles from North America and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.130" end="00:07:34.230" style="s2">single Russian soldier decided that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.030" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">was a false alarm and refused to push</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.230" end="00:07:39.690" style="s2">the button that would have resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:41.220" style="s2">major retaliation he just died about a</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.220" end="00:07:48.870" style="s2">Wikipedia anyways I read Solzhenitsyn in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.580" end="00:07:50.430" style="s2">1970s and and that made me me even I</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.870" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">would say more obsessed with what was</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.430" end="00:07:58.380" style="s2">happening in in on the world stage I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:08:00.570" style="s2">trying to understand why it was that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.380" end="00:08:03.870" style="s2">systems of belief that we inhabited</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.570" end="00:08:07.140" style="s2">let&#39;s say one typifying the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.870" end="00:08:11.370" style="s2">and in similar States Maoist China North</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.140" end="00:08:13.920" style="s2">Korea wonderful places like that versus</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">the West we each had our own way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.920" end="00:08:18.090" style="s2">construing the world the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:21.390" style="s2">construing the world were set at odds</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.090" end="00:08:22.970" style="s2">with one another and the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.390" end="00:08:26.670" style="s2">were set at odds with one another</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.970" end="00:08:33.270" style="s2">appeared to be so significant that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.670" end="00:08:36.030" style="s2">armed ourselves with 50,000 Hydra</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:37.500" style="s2">hydrogen bombs on each side something</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.030" end="00:08:39.390" style="s2">like that I don&#39;t know how much you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.500" end="00:08:41.880" style="s2">about a hydrogen bomb you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.390" end="00:08:43.920" style="s2">about atomic bombs you know that a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.880" end="00:08:49.140" style="s2">hydrogen bomb has an atomic bomb for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.920" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">trigger right so so like the atom bomb</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.140" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">that was dropped on Hiroshima that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:54.960" style="s2">something that was a fission bomb not</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:58.490" style="s2">standard atomic bomb the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.960" end="00:09:00.840" style="s2">generation but hydrogen bomb is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.490" end="00:09:05.010" style="s2">incontestably more powerful than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.840" end="00:09:06.930" style="s2">and we were producing them in the tens</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.010" end="00:09:09.960" style="s2">of thousands it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.930" end="00:09:13.470" style="s2">any now but it was really some insanity</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.960" end="00:09:15.870" style="s2">in the 1980s and people seem to have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.470" end="00:09:19.710" style="s2">very itchy trigger finger so I was very</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.870" end="00:09:21.510" style="s2">confused about this in two ways one and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.710" end="00:09:23.100" style="s2">from a psychological perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.510" end="00:09:24.960" style="s2">by that time I did study just</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.100" end="00:09:28.260" style="s2">to study psychology instead of political</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.960" end="00:09:30.450" style="s2">science which was my original major I I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.260" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">get I got disenchanted with political</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.450" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">science because I didn&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.820" style="s2">people were fundamentally motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:38.340" style="s2">economic issues I still don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.820" end="00:09:40.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s true they&#39;re motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.340" end="00:09:43.700" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re motivated by it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.200" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">be captured by economics not precisely</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.700" end="00:09:48.980" style="s2">it&#39;s very curious about what it was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:51.390" style="s2">was so important about a belief system</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.980" end="00:09:54.840" style="s2">that people would risk putting the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.390" end="00:09:56.820" style="s2">entire planet to the torch to ensure</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.840" end="00:09:59.490" style="s2">that their particular mode of construing</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.820" end="00:10:00.870" style="s2">the world prevailed was an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.490" end="00:10:03.510" style="s2">psychological problem what was so</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.870" end="00:10:06.150" style="s2">important about belief system that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.510" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">justify destroying everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.150" end="00:10:09.270" style="s2">here risking destroying everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:19.470" style="s2">because that was certainly the situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.270" end="00:10:21.780" style="s2">we put ourselves in and more to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.470" end="00:10:23.940" style="s2">point I guess or equally to the point I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.780" end="00:10:28.350" style="s2">was interested in two other things one</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.940" end="00:10:30.600" style="s2">was were these differences in belief</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.350" end="00:10:32.550" style="s2">systems just arbitrary and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.600" end="00:10:34.890" style="s2">actually a postmodern question I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.550" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">know that at the time no because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.890" end="00:10:38.400" style="s2">might say the post modernists do say</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:41.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a very large number of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.400" end="00:10:43.620" style="s2">interpreting the world and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.160" end="00:10:45.960" style="s2">obvious how you determine which of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.620" end="00:10:47.520" style="s2">ways are correct and so perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.960" end="00:10:49.890" style="s2">can&#39;t determine that any of them are</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.520" end="00:10:52.050" style="s2">correct and then as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.890" end="00:10:53.550" style="s2">your inability to determine if any of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.050" end="00:10:57.060" style="s2">them are correct then you have to turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.550" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">to something like power dispute to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.060" end="00:11:02.460" style="s2">establish which interpretation is going</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:04.980" style="s2">to take precedence I would say in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.460" end="00:11:06.690" style="s2">nutshell that&#39;s a post modernist theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.980" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">now that&#39;s tainted to some degree with</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.690" end="00:11:10.830" style="s2">Marxist preconceptions but we won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:12.780" style="s2">into that but that&#39;s basically the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.830" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s an idea with a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.780" end="00:11:17.490" style="s2">of justification there is a very large</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:20.700" style="s2">number of ways of interpreting the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.490" end="00:11:24.930" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t obvious which way or ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.700" end="00:11:27.000" style="s2">are right or why they&#39;re right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.930" end="00:11:29.790" style="s2">complicated problem and so I was curious</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.000" end="00:11:32.790" style="s2">is like was this merely a difference of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.790" end="00:11:34.950" style="s2">opinion the West had a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.790" end="00:11:36.580" style="s2">axioms that it was acting out in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.950" end="00:11:38.260" style="s2">world and there</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.580" end="00:11:39.670" style="s2">Soviet bloc and the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.260" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">communist countries had another set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.670" end="00:11:46.030" style="s2">axioms and they were both arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:48.190" style="s2">it was a matter of power or was there</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.030" end="00:11:49.930" style="s2">something deeper at stake so that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.190" end="00:11:54.090" style="s2">question number two question number</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.930" end="00:12:00.400" style="s2">three was was there an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.090" end="00:12:02.410" style="s2">brutal combat was there an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.400" end="00:12:05.620" style="s2">way of solving the dispute to brutal</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.410" end="00:12:06.820" style="s2">group combat something like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.620" end="00:12:09.430" style="s2">because I always believed that if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.820" end="00:12:12.610" style="s2">understood a problem that you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.430" end="00:12:14.380" style="s2">solve it in fact that if yes if when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.610" end="00:12:16.150" style="s2">analyze the problem a solution didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.380" end="00:12:18.070" style="s2">emerge from the analysis then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.150" end="00:12:23.020" style="s2">actually didn&#39;t understand the problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.070" end="00:12:25.090" style="s2">and so I thought if I delved into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.020" end="00:12:26.740" style="s2">problem deeply enough then maybe I could</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.090" end="00:12:28.620" style="s2">figure out what might constitute a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.740" end="00:12:32.680" style="s2">solution assuming there was such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.620" end="00:12:34.420" style="s2">because I couldn&#39;t I knew after writing</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.680" end="00:12:37.570" style="s2">a fair bit of it that we were that there</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.420" end="00:12:39.910" style="s2">was a real problem because you can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.570" end="00:12:42.700" style="s2">belief systems that are locked in combat</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.910" end="00:12:46.150" style="s2">and then obviously the terrible</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.700" end="00:12:47.830" style="s2">consequence of that is the combat but</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.150" end="00:12:49.060" style="s2">then I also knew and this was probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.830" end="00:12:51.100" style="s2">more from reading Nietzsche than</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.060" end="00:12:52.540" style="s2">anything else that if your belief system</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.100" end="00:12:55.030" style="s2">collapses you might say well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.540" end="00:12:56.920" style="s2">want to fight with you about whose</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.030" end="00:13:00.070" style="s2">belief system is correct I&#39;ll just let</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.920" end="00:13:01.780" style="s2">my mind go but the problem is if you let</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.070" end="00:13:04.410" style="s2">your belief system go then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.780" end="00:13:07.300" style="s2">swamped by nihilism and hopelessness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.410" end="00:13:09.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s not helpful first of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.300" end="00:13:11.980" style="s2">very it&#39;s not helpful psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.310" end="00:13:14.170" style="s2">because it produces motional pain and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.980" end="00:13:16.360" style="s2">anxiety and maybe at unbearable levels</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.170" end="00:13:19.420" style="s2">you can&#39;t have a pointless life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.360" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a suffering a pointless</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:24.360" style="s2">life is pointless suffering and people</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:26.950" style="s2">can&#39;t sustain that without becoming</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.360" end="00:13:29.910" style="s2">demoralized that&#39;s only where they start</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.950" end="00:13:32.860" style="s2">demoralized bitter cruel resentful angry</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.910" end="00:13:35.350" style="s2">hostile murderous genocide alike all</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.860" end="00:13:38.020" style="s2">those things follow one from another if</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.350" end="00:13:40.900" style="s2">if things are sufficiently hopeless you</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.020" end="00:13:42.430" style="s2">can&#39;t just let your belief system go but</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.900" end="00:13:44.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re locked into it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.430" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">another one that you&#39;re competing with</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.200" end="00:13:49.570" style="s2">then the the consequence is war it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:50.200" style="s2">like so what is it nihilism on the one</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:51.910" style="s2">hand in war</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.200" end="00:13:54.610" style="s2">on the other that didn&#39;t seem like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.910" end="00:13:57.520" style="s2">especially given the outcome of like say</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.610" end="00:13:58.900" style="s2">the third world war that neither of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.520" end="00:14:00.310" style="s2">those seemed like acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.900" end="00:14:03.160" style="s2">alternatives but I couldn&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.310" end="00:14:04.540" style="s2">other I couldn&#39;t see that there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.160" end="00:14:06.580" style="s2">anything else other than those two</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.540" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">alternatives and so that&#39;s what I tried</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.580" end="00:14:11.530" style="s2">to lay out in in this book maps of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:13.900" style="s2">meaning and most of the thoughts that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.530" end="00:14:15.670" style="s2">expressed in 12 rules for life not all</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.900" end="00:14:17.410" style="s2">of them and in the lectures that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.670" end="00:14:19.900" style="s2">done that have become popular on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.410" end="00:14:21.670" style="s2">were all developed during the 15 year</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.900" end="00:14:24.390" style="s2">period that I worked on that book and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.670" end="00:14:26.890" style="s2">worked on it I would say obsessively</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.390" end="00:14:30.100" style="s2">really I wrote about three hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.890" end="00:14:33.330" style="s2">and I thought about it for pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.100" end="00:14:36.340" style="s2">12 other hours and so I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.330" end="00:14:38.500" style="s2">constantly it was it&#39;s not obvious why</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.340" end="00:14:40.780" style="s2">but well I told you why for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.500" end="00:14:46.540" style="s2">all that manifested itself to me as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.780" end="00:14:48.760" style="s2">cardinal problem but I concluded and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.540" end="00:14:53.620" style="s2">tried to lay out the rationale for this</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.760" end="00:14:56.020" style="s2">that the the fight between these two</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.620" end="00:14:57.490" style="s2">belief systems but let&#39;s let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.020" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">the belief systems it&#39;s not communism</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.490" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">versus the West it&#39;s not communism</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:03.610" style="s2">versus the free market it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:06.850" style="s2">different than that it&#39;s collectivism in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.610" end="00:15:08.950" style="s2">its far right form let&#39;s say the far</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.850" end="00:15:11.170" style="s2">right form of the Nazis and the far left</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.950" end="00:15:14.290" style="s2">form of the radical leftists the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.170" end="00:15:16.690" style="s2">Communists that&#39;s collectivism versus</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.290" end="00:15:19.510" style="s2">individualism that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.690" end="00:15:20.890" style="s2">conflict and there are variants of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.510" end="00:15:22.180" style="s2">collectivist viewpoint but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.890" end="00:15:24.400" style="s2">matter they can be grouped under the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">rubric of collectivism there&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.400" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">differences but we don&#39;t have to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:29.980" style="s2">into that the Western take wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.440" style="s2">collectivist it was individualist</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.980" end="00:15:35.410" style="s2">and the central idea of the West was</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.440" end="00:15:39.430" style="s2">that although people are obviously</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.410" end="00:15:40.810" style="s2">obviously aggregate into groups and many</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.430" end="00:15:43.350" style="s2">different groups because all of you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.810" end="00:15:47.620" style="s2">members of very of many different groups</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.350" end="00:15:50.080" style="s2">ethnicities genders sexes races family</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.620" end="00:15:51.760" style="s2">groups community groups you can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.080" end="00:15:54.730" style="s2">grouped a very large number of ways and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.760" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">and you tend towards the adoption of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.730" end="00:15:58.300" style="s2">something approximating a group identity</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:00.070" style="s2">because you know you take care of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.300" end="00:16:01.690" style="s2">family and you&#39;re a member of your</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.070" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">community and you have a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.690" end="00:16:06.130" style="s2">of justifiable pay tree</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:07.930" style="s2">him in relationship to your state the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.130" end="00:16:11.650" style="s2">group identity is definitely part of who</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.930" end="00:16:14.050" style="s2">you are the question is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.650" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">fundamental defining characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.050" end="00:16:20.110" style="s2">who you are and the collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:23.020" style="s2">definition is that you are the avatar of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.110" end="00:16:25.270" style="s2">a collective and that&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.020" end="00:16:27.250" style="s2">who you are but the Western perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.270" end="00:16:29.950" style="s2">is not that the Western perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.250" end="00:16:32.020" style="s2">that despite the fact that people have</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.950" end="00:16:34.570" style="s2">an individual level and a collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.020" end="00:16:37.180" style="s2">level the individual level is to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.570" end="00:16:40.300" style="s2">regarded as paramount you&#39;re to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.180" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">treated above all L above all as an</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.300" end="00:16:45.430" style="s2">individual now and I looked into that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:49.300" style="s2">very deeply and I thought that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.430" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">arbitrary it&#39;s actually correct that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.300" end="00:16:52.930" style="s2">the right way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:54.850" style="s2">and then you might say well what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.930" end="00:16:56.920" style="s2">mean the right way and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.850" end="00:16:57.520" style="s2">the right question because that is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.920" end="00:16:59.560" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.520" end="00:17:02.050" style="s2">if something&#39;s the right way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.560" end="00:17:05.800" style="s2">at something why is it the right way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.050" end="00:17:08.290" style="s2">looking at it but I want to put a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.800" end="00:17:10.660" style="s2">spin on that too because usually when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.290" end="00:17:13.209" style="s2">talk about individualism in the West at</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.660" end="00:17:15.699" style="s2">least in the modern world maybe let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.209" end="00:17:17.560" style="s2">say for the last 50 years or something</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.699" end="00:17:19.150" style="s2">like that maybe it&#39;s after World War 2 I</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.560" end="00:17:21.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly the parameters it</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.150" end="00:17:23.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter certainly since the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.250" end="00:17:26.079" style="s2">when we think about the tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.560" end="00:17:28.650" style="s2">individuality in the West we think about</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:33.070" style="s2">the tradition of individual rights and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.650" end="00:17:35.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem with that because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.070" end="00:17:38.590" style="s2">fundamental individual tradition of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.560" end="00:17:40.960" style="s2">West is not individual rights and rights</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.590" end="00:17:43.330" style="s2">have a problem rights are sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.960" end="00:17:46.030" style="s2">your privilege compared to other people</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.330" end="00:17:50.290" style="s2">I have these rights and don&#39;t tread on</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.030" end="00:17:53.290" style="s2">them that that walls me off and makes me</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.290" end="00:17:55.060" style="s2">privileged in some sense it means that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.290" end="00:17:57.400" style="s2">have the right to do things I have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.060" end="00:17:59.410" style="s2">right to pursue my own interests I have</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.400" end="00:18:01.930" style="s2">the right to pursue happiness for</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.410" end="00:18:04.930" style="s2">example that&#39;s explicitly laid out in</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.930" end="00:18:07.090" style="s2">the American system the rights are what</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.930" end="00:18:09.430" style="s2">is special about me and so when you look</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.090" end="00:18:11.470" style="s2">at individuality or individualism from</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.430" end="00:18:14.020" style="s2">that perspective you can think about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.470" end="00:18:16.390" style="s2">as a selfish idea and it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.020" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">criticized by collectivists precisely</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.390" end="00:18:20.009" style="s2">for that selfishness</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:21.720" style="s2">but the fundamental idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.009" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">individual in the West isn&#39;t predicated</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.720" end="00:18:28.169" style="s2">on rights even though that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:31.889" style="s2">it&#39;s predicated on responsibility right</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.169" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">so your role as an individual in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.889" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">West isn&#39;t to be the bearer of Rights of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:40.350" style="s2">intrinsic rights even though those are</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:43.669" style="s2">important your responsibility as an</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.350" end="00:18:47.190" style="s2">individual in the West is to bear the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.669" end="00:18:50.009" style="s2">responsibility of an individual and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.190" end="00:18:52.169" style="s2">in bearing that responsibility that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.009" end="00:18:55.350" style="s2">set yourself right and your family right</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.169" end="00:18:57.179" style="s2">and you keep the state on track it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.350" end="00:18:59.240" style="s2">from expressing your rights</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.179" end="00:19:02.429" style="s2">it&#39;s from shouldering your</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.240" end="00:19:04.470" style="s2">responsibility and I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.429" end="00:19:07.019" style="s2">reason that you have rights in the West</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.470" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">is so that you can shoulder your</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.019" end="00:19:09.809" style="s2">responsibilities it&#39;s not the other way</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.419" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.809" end="00:19:14.730" style="s2">it&#39;s so that you can do what&#39;s best on</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.419" end="00:19:17.340" style="s2">your behalf and in that manner do what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.730" end="00:19:19.590" style="s2">best on your family&#39;s behalf and in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.340" end="00:19:22.740" style="s2">manner contribute to the degree that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.590" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">can to the community and that if you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.740" end="00:19:27.000" style="s2">all those things simultaneously which</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:30.899" style="s2">means to accept the responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.000" end="00:19:33.149" style="s2">that then things move ahead as well as</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.899" end="00:19:36.029" style="s2">they can move ahead which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.149" end="00:19:38.759" style="s2">necessarily mean well because life is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.029" end="00:19:43.409" style="s2">very difficult and there&#39;s no sure way</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.759" end="00:19:45.179" style="s2">through it there&#39;s only less bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.409" end="00:19:47.879" style="s2">approaches that might be a way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.179" end="00:19:50.970" style="s2">thinking about it and the least bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.879" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">approach you can manage is to shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.970" end="00:19:56.639" style="s2">your responsibilities as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:59.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s the and I would say that one</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.639" end="00:20:01.850" style="s2">of the things that drives the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.159" end="00:20:04.889" style="s2">collectivist ethos which is often</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.850" end="00:20:06.750" style="s2">formulated in terms of compassion for</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.750" end="00:20:12.269" style="s2">talk about a little bit later is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.490" end="00:20:16.409" style="s2">actually a deep desire to at all costs</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.269" end="00:20:19.139" style="s2">avoid that responsibility and it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.409" end="00:20:22.139" style="s2">wonder because the responsibility is</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.990" end="00:21:35.400" style="s2">to that most so I developed that idea in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.840" end="00:21:38.340" style="s2">maps of meaning that and I made a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.400" end="00:21:41.420" style="s2">lectures about that look many of which</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.340" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">are on YouTube some of which have become</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.420" end="00:21:47.160" style="s2">widely viewed I would say by hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:49.740" style="s2">thousands of people now and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.160" end="00:21:52.920" style="s2">and that course always had a dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.740" end="00:21:55.440" style="s2">effect on my students and their most</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.920" end="00:21:58.290" style="s2">typical comment there&#39;s two classes of</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.440" end="00:21:59.820" style="s2">typical comments that I got from</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.290" end="00:22:01.710" style="s2">students about my maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.820" end="00:22:03.150" style="s2">courses it&#39;s the same comments that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.710" end="00:22:05.580" style="s2">get from people now when they come and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.150" end="00:22:07.560" style="s2">talk to me about my lectures the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.580" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">comment is and this is about maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.560" end="00:22:14.510" style="s2">quarter of the people is that watching</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:17.250" style="s2">the lectures are taking the course</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.510" end="00:22:18.690" style="s2">enabled them to put words to things they</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.250" end="00:22:22.260" style="s2">knew they knew but didn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.690" end="00:22:25.290" style="s2">say and so and that&#39;s fine because that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.260" end="00:22:27.300" style="s2">was an explicit purpose of the writing</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.290" end="00:22:28.830" style="s2">and the course and the second is that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.300" end="00:22:31.530" style="s2">helped people straighten out their lives</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.830" end="00:22:34.110" style="s2">and that&#39;s also not that surprising to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.530" end="00:22:37.500" style="s2">me because a lot of what I integrated</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.110" end="00:22:39.210" style="s2">into that book and the lectures and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.500" end="00:22:41.730" style="s2">the lectures that were also associated</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.210" end="00:22:44.430" style="s2">with my personality course were ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.730" end="00:22:45.810" style="s2">from the great clinical psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.430" end="00:22:48.270" style="s2">and psychiatrists of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.810" end="00:22:50.930" style="s2">a century there was a dozen of them or</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.270" end="00:22:54.290" style="s2">so or maybe 20 who were all outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.930" end="00:22:57.330" style="s2">geniuses of slightly different types who</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.290" end="00:22:59.220" style="s2">learned all sorts of things about how</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.330" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">people could put themself together</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.220" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">properly as individuals and if you learn</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:04.980" style="s2">about those things they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:07.140" style="s2">really helpful that&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.980" end="00:23:11.070" style="s2">because they sit at the core of an</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.140" end="00:23:12.600" style="s2">entire domain of science and art let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.070" end="00:23:17.510" style="s2">say devoted to improving people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.600" end="00:23:21.330" style="s2">individual lives I wove the</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.330" end="00:23:27.060" style="s2">because that&#39;s really what it is in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.910" end="00:23:30.900" style="s2">sense it&#39;s a call to the voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.060" end="00:23:33.090" style="s2">adoption of maximal individual</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.900" end="00:23:36.150" style="s2">responsibility and it&#39;s a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.090" end="00:23:38.100" style="s2">work not a political work now I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.150" end="00:23:41.460" style="s2">the reason that it&#39;s attracted so much</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.100" end="00:23:43.410" style="s2">political attention let&#39;s say some of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.460" end="00:23:46.620" style="s2">which gun logger referred to in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.410" end="00:23:48.750" style="s2">introduction is well there&#39;s two reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.620" end="00:23:50.460" style="s2">one is because I took what might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.750" end="00:23:52.770" style="s2">regarded as a political stance about</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.460" end="00:23:54.810" style="s2">some compelled speech legislation in</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.770" end="00:23:57.240" style="s2">Canada I never regarded that as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.810" end="00:23:59.160" style="s2">political move because I regarded the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.240" end="00:24:02.340" style="s2">legislation itself as something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.160" end="00:24:04.650" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a political move I regarded it as</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.340" end="00:24:06.990" style="s2">an attempt by the politicians to jump</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.650" end="00:24:09.570" style="s2">outside their domain of acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.990" end="00:24:11.670" style="s2">conduct into the philosophical or even</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.570" end="00:24:15.450" style="s2">the theological realm because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.670" end="00:24:17.580" style="s2">mess with the idea of free speech in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.450" end="00:24:19.800" style="s2">western country and there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.580" end="00:24:21.630" style="s2">sophisticated reasons for that and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.800" end="00:24:25.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what your reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.630" end="00:24:28.650" style="s2">doing it are you don&#39;t go there and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.500" end="00:24:30.660" style="s2">but it happened to be the more radical</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.650" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">leftists that we&#39;re pushing this forward</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.660" end="00:24:35.160" style="s2">and because I objected to it then it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:39.300" style="s2">in their interest to assume that I must</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.160" end="00:24:42.090" style="s2">be the worst sort of right-wing diehard</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.300" end="00:24:44.790" style="s2">I suppose because otherwise they&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.090" end="00:24:47.280" style="s2">to contend with my actual arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.790" end="00:24:49.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s simpler just to shoot the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.280" end="00:24:51.690" style="s2">messenger than to contend with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.560" end="00:24:54.330" style="s2">arguments and you know if you stand up</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.690" end="00:24:56.130" style="s2">and say there&#39;s something wrong in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.330" end="00:24:58.380" style="s2">place like Canada where most things</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.130" end="00:24:59.650" style="s2">aren&#39;t wrong then it&#39;s reasonable also</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.380" end="00:25:01.420" style="s2">for people to assume they&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.650" end="00:25:02.890" style="s2">be something wrong with you because most</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.420" end="00:25:04.930" style="s2">of the time there isn&#39;t anything wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.890" end="00:25:07.240" style="s2">with the country and so a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.930" end="00:25:12.460" style="s2">of testing is a reasonable thing for</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.240" end="00:25:14.110" style="s2">people to do I guess the other element</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.460" end="00:25:16.420" style="s2">of this that&#39;s political in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.110" end="00:25:18.280" style="s2">though is that within the collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.420" end="00:25:20.290" style="s2">viewpoint this is something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.280" end="00:25:21.670" style="s2">interesting with regard to free speech I</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.290" end="00:25:22.690" style="s2">didn&#39;t really figure this out till a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.670" end="00:25:25.270" style="s2">couple of weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.690" end="00:25:26.680" style="s2">although the radical leftists and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.270" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">see this particularly in the United</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.680" end="00:25:31.510" style="s2">States now although the Americans have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:34.510" style="s2">very strong tradition of free speech the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.510" end="00:25:36.520" style="s2">radical leftists are opposed to freedom</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.510" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">of speech but that&#39;s not really right</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.520" end="00:25:41.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not the way to think about in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:43.180" style="s2">radical leftist collectivist view of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.110" end="00:25:46.630" style="s2">world there&#39;s actually no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.180" end="00:25:49.750" style="s2">free speech it&#39;s a worse criticism than</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.630" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">then opposing it because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.750" end="00:25:53.530" style="s2">collectivists believe that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:56.200" style="s2">nothing but an avatar of your group</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.530" end="00:25:57.910" style="s2">first of all there is no you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.200" end="00:26:01.180" style="s2">defined by your group membership and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.910" end="00:26:05.260" style="s2">then the world is a landscape of groups</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.180" end="00:26:08.230" style="s2">each vying for predominance and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.260" end="00:26:11.320" style="s2">what there is and it&#39;s and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.230" end="00:26:13.390" style="s2">say that you&#39;re speaking your mind that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.320" end="00:26:15.700" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that you can do from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.390" end="00:26:18.700" style="s2">collectivist viewpoint what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.700" end="00:26:21.490" style="s2">is acting as an unconscious avatar of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.700" end="00:26:24.190" style="s2">the power demands of your group there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.490" end="00:26:26.710" style="s2">no you there&#39;s no free speech there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.190" end="00:26:29.190" style="s2">your opinion there&#39;s no facts for that</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:40.330" style="s2">cannot communicate and so the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.300" end="00:26:43.900" style="s2">reason that I detest let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.330" end="00:26:46.450" style="s2">collectivist viewpoint is because I see</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.900" end="00:26:50.070" style="s2">that it leads nowhere but to conflict</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.450" end="00:26:53.890" style="s2">because if people cannot speak as</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.070" end="00:26:57.100" style="s2">individuals between groups then all they</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.890" end="00:27:01.930" style="s2">can do is submit or fight those are the</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.660" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">in the absence of capitulation or</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.280" end="00:27:19.640" style="s2">conflict is speech because we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:22.010" style="s2">over our differences and that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.640" end="00:27:25.190" style="s2">is going to be contentious because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.010" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">actually have differences but compared</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.190" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">to the contentiousness of not talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:30.170" style="s2">over the differences it&#39;s a walk in the</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.170" end="00:27:34.400" style="s2">you know I saw something quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.910" end="00:27:36.500" style="s2">remarkable when I was in London a month</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.400" end="00:27:39.260" style="s2">and a half ago I was on this political</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.500" end="00:27:40.520" style="s2">show and one of the things they did in</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.260" end="00:27:42.920" style="s2">this section that didn&#39;t have anything</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.520" end="00:27:47.960" style="s2">to do with me was to show a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.920" end="00:27:49.880" style="s2">clips from the the there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.960" end="00:27:52.310" style="s2">period that the British have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.880" end="00:27:54.560" style="s2">where the opposition can go after the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.310" end="00:27:56.870" style="s2">Prime Minister and the woman that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.560" end="00:27:58.940" style="s2">appearing with me on the show had</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.870" end="00:28:01.130" style="s2">written a book about that called Punch</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.940" end="00:28:03.920" style="s2">and Judy if I remember correctly and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.130" end="00:28:06.830" style="s2">they showed a bunch of clips of English</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.920" end="00:28:08.930" style="s2">MPs attacking the prime minister and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.830" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">Prime Minister&#39;s response all the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.930" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">from Thatcher forward it was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:16.130" style="s2">vicious in the way that well-educated</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.110" end="00:28:43.370" style="s2">stand and they were hurling invective</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.850" end="00:28:45.410" style="s2">and making criticisms and making</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.370" end="00:28:48.440" style="s2">accusations and defending themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.410" end="00:28:51.470" style="s2">all of that but it was all contained</p>

<p begin="00:29:02.660" end="00:29:07.970" style="s2">because the alternative to free speech</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.430" end="00:29:10.700" style="s2">is capitulation or conflict and unless</p>

<p begin="00:29:18.380" end="00:29:22.580" style="s2">to clarify that and to negotiate with</p>

<p begin="00:29:59.210" end="00:30:04.059" style="s2">with all of your peculiarities your</p>

<p begin="00:30:04.059" end="00:30:09.890" style="s2">the way you do that is by acting in the</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.890" end="00:30:14.659" style="s2">by thinking and really what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.500" end="00:30:16.280" style="s2">when you&#39;re thinking so philosopher</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.650" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">idea so the way animals adapt to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.799" end="00:30:33.799" style="s2">world across time is that animals</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:35.809" style="s2">produce variants variant offspring many</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.510" end="00:30:43.909" style="s2">are successful enough in that time and</p>

<p begin="00:30:54.230" end="00:30:58.280" style="s2">thing but we also have figured out how</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.940" end="00:31:01.370" style="s2">to abstract that and so what we do when</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.280" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">we think is that we produce a fictional</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.370" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">world that&#39;s a simulation of the real</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:10.010" style="s2">world and we populate that simulated</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">world with simulations of us and then we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.010" end="00:31:13.940" style="s2">let those simulations play out in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:16.730" style="s2">simulated world and the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.940" end="00:31:18.950" style="s2">successful we embody and act out and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.730" end="00:31:21.409" style="s2">ones that are unsuccessful we abandon</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.950" end="00:31:24.830" style="s2">and let die and we do that when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.409" end="00:31:27.110" style="s2">thinking in dreams and we do that when</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.830" end="00:31:29.330" style="s2">we think in stories and we even do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.110" end="00:31:31.789" style="s2">when we think in words although it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.330" end="00:31:33.620" style="s2">as obvious when you argue internally</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.789" end="00:31:36.020" style="s2">which is what you do when you think you</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.620" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">have an avatar that manifests itself as</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.020" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">one point of view and then avatar that</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:40.680" style="s2">manifests itself as another and you let</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.170" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.680" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">engage in conflict and the one that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.170" end="00:31:47.940" style="s2">loses you let go of that&#39;s a sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:49.920" style="s2">and if you&#39;re discussing something with</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.940" end="00:31:51.690" style="s2">someone and it&#39;s important then you both</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.920" end="00:31:54.180" style="s2">put your viewpoints forward and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.690" end="00:31:56.820" style="s2">analyze the consequences of the dispute</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.180" end="00:31:58.830" style="s2">and then you walk away with any luck why</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.820" end="00:32:00.900" style="s2">is there than you were so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.830" end="00:32:03.150" style="s2">embody a mode of being that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.900" end="00:32:06.210" style="s2">likely to be successful and you do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.150" end="00:32:08.670" style="s2">in part in large part by exercising your</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.210" end="00:32:10.350" style="s2">freedom of speech and you might think</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.670" end="00:32:12.030" style="s2">well why freedom of speech and not</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.350" end="00:32:15.230" style="s2">freedom of thought and the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.030" end="00:32:18.750" style="s2">that is don&#39;t be thinking that you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.230" end="00:32:21.330" style="s2">because thinking is very hard and most</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.750" end="00:32:23.250" style="s2">people can&#39;t think at all and even if</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.330" end="00:32:24.990" style="s2">you can think you&#39;re not very good at it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.250" end="00:32:27.390" style="s2">I mean think about what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.990" end="00:32:29.280" style="s2">technically to think first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.390" end="00:32:30.929" style="s2">have to formulate the problem that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.280" end="00:32:32.850" style="s2">hard enough and you have to formulate it</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.929" end="00:32:35.340" style="s2">precisely then you have to generate</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.850" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">multiple potential solutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.340" end="00:32:41.250" style="s2">problem and then you have to let those</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:44.700" style="s2">solutions argue themselves into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.250" end="00:32:46.260" style="s2">hierarchy internally and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.700" end="00:32:47.730" style="s2">be able to tolerate that stress right</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.260" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t just be one thing if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.730" end="00:32:51.720" style="s2">gonna think because thinking isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:53.429" style="s2">saying that what I think is right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.720" end="00:32:54.690" style="s2">not thinking at all thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.429" end="00:32:56.520" style="s2">questioning whether or not what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.690" end="00:32:59.280" style="s2">think is right is right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.520" end="00:33:01.320" style="s2">really hard it&#39;s very demanding and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.280" end="00:33:02.670" style="s2">and you can do that to some degree but</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.320" end="00:33:04.050" style="s2">you&#39;re not as good at it as you think</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.670" end="00:33:05.910" style="s2">even if you&#39;re a pretty good thinker</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.050" end="00:33:10.140" style="s2">mostly the way you think is by talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.910" end="00:33:13.140" style="s2">and you talk and mostly when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.140" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">and think it&#39;s contentious as you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.140" end="00:33:17.850" style="s2">if you&#39;ve ever had an intimate</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.710" style="s2">relationship with someone because an</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.850" end="00:33:21.809" style="s2">intimate relationship if it if it has</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.710" end="00:33:24.630" style="s2">any worth at all is a place where</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.809" end="00:33:26.850" style="s2">there&#39;s tremendous contention but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.630" end="00:33:28.950" style="s2">bounded within something approximating</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.850" end="00:33:30.900" style="s2">mutual respect and the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.950" end="00:33:32.520" style="s2">continue to play the game across time</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.900" end="00:33:34.290" style="s2">and the reason that an intimate</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.520" end="00:33:36.510" style="s2">relationship is contentious is because</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.290" end="00:33:37.770" style="s2">life is very very difficult and people</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.510" end="00:33:39.750" style="s2">are different and we face</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.770" end="00:33:42.059" style="s2">extraordinarily complex problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.750" end="00:33:44.910" style="s2">together like how to make a living and</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.229" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">are extraordinarily difficult problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.939" end="00:34:06.769" style="s2">and the only way that we can solve them</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:09.269" style="s2">is by butting heads to some degree and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.769" end="00:34:11.339" style="s2">communicating freely about what the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.269" end="00:34:13.829" style="s2">possibilities are and negotiating a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.339" end="00:34:15.990" style="s2">solution and that&#39;s thinking and in</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.829" end="00:34:17.940" style="s2">order to do that thinking you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.990" end="00:34:21.059" style="s2">able to speak freely and you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.940" end="00:34:22.919" style="s2">have to be willing to offend someone I</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.539" end="00:34:57.509" style="s2">hypothetically discuss something</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.889" end="00:35:00.509" style="s2">important without one of us getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.509" end="00:35:03.299" style="s2">upset it&#39;s like that&#39;s not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.509" end="00:35:06.630" style="s2">if you ever discuss anything important</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.299" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">with anyone including just discussing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.630" end="00:35:10.319" style="s2">with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:11.910" style="s2">not only are you gonna get upset you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.319" end="00:35:14.849" style="s2">gonna get so upset that you probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.910" end="00:35:17.130" style="s2">won&#39;t even do it you know you think well</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.849" end="00:35:19.529" style="s2">I have a difficult problem what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.130" end="00:35:21.569" style="s2">first reaction well I&#39;m gonna sit right</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.529" end="00:35:23.160" style="s2">here and think about that it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.569" end="00:35:25.349" style="s2">that isn&#39;t your reaction your action is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.160" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">to go like play a video game or watch a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.349" end="00:35:30.509" style="s2">YouTube video or or vacuum your bedroom</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:32.339" style="s2">or do the dishes or whatever you can do</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.509" end="00:35:35.700" style="s2">not to think about that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.339" end="00:35:37.170" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do so you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.700" end="00:35:39.269" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna have a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.170" end="00:35:41.160" style="s2">your wife or your husband or your kids</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.269" end="00:35:43.289" style="s2">and it&#39;s about something important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.160" end="00:35:45.690" style="s2">like if you if you&#39;re a normal person</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.289" end="00:35:47.309" style="s2">your heart rate goes up and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.690" end="00:35:48.150" style="s2">it&#39;s demanding and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.309" end="00:35:49.769" style="s2">think it through and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.150" end="00:35:51.779" style="s2">probably wrong and you&#39;re gonna stumble</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.769" end="00:35:53.039" style="s2">over your words and god only knows if</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.779" end="00:35:54.930" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna reach a solution and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.039" end="00:35:57.390" style="s2">can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s gonna mean the end of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.930" end="00:35:59.339" style="s2">your damn relationship and like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.390" end="00:36:01.319" style="s2">catastrophe lurks everywhere when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.339" end="00:36:03.420" style="s2">discussing difficult issues and the rule</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.319" end="00:36:05.730" style="s2">is something like but you can&#39;t offend</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.420" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">anyone it&#39;s like well then okay fine</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.730" end="00:36:08.040" style="s2">then you never get to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:10.230" style="s2">anything that&#39;s important with any</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.040" end="00:36:11.940" style="s2">whenever including yourself it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.230" end="00:36:13.800" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to be the rule then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.940" end="00:36:15.840" style="s2">think well even if it&#39;s not quite that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.800" end="00:36:18.420" style="s2">bad it&#39;s like let&#39;s say so here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.840" end="00:36:20.610" style="s2">addressing about 850 people something</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.420" end="00:36:22.200" style="s2">like that it&#39;s like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.610" end="00:36:24.600" style="s2">probability that I could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.200" end="00:36:26.460" style="s2">anything that any of you would ever want</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.600" end="00:36:28.380" style="s2">to listen to for more than about 15</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.460" end="00:36:30.330" style="s2">seconds you know that would grip your</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.380" end="00:36:32.490" style="s2">interest without me offending at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.330" end="00:36:34.950" style="s2">one person in this room with each</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.490" end="00:36:37.590" style="s2">sentence there&#39;s a thousand people in</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.950" end="00:36:39.840" style="s2">here you know and some people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.590" end="00:36:41.610" style="s2">unbelievably easy to offend there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.840" end="00:36:44.310" style="s2">they&#39;re just looking for a reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.610" end="00:36:46.260" style="s2">offended so so there&#39;s that problem but</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.310" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">if we&#39;re gonna deal with things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.260" end="00:36:52.290" style="s2">that are solid and contentious and why</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:53.910" style="s2">talk about things that we already all</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.290" end="00:36:55.740" style="s2">agree on we&#39;ve already solved those</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.910" end="00:36:57.780" style="s2">problems we can only really talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.740" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">things we don&#39;t agree on it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.780" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">thing worth talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:03.960" style="s2">well of course everyone&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">offended and so for a journalist to ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.960" end="00:37:09.660" style="s2">that it&#39;s like what the hell&#39;s with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:11.690" style="s2">what what planet do you inhabit don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.660" end="00:37:16.170" style="s2">you understand that your entire</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.690" end="00:37:18.600" style="s2">discipline is predicated on not only</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.170" end="00:37:21.180" style="s2">your right to offend someone but the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.600" end="00:37:24.280" style="s2">responsibility that you have to offend</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.180" end="00:37:31.829" style="s2">people it&#39;s like that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.309" end="00:37:46.439" style="s2">thinking isn&#39;t offensive out which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.589" end="00:37:49.459" style="s2">why tyrants hate it right because one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.439" end="00:37:52.739" style="s2">the rules in the tyranny is don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.459" end="00:37:56.039" style="s2">why because I already know all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.739" end="00:37:58.439" style="s2">answers and you&#39;re supposed to accept my</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.039" end="00:38:00.989" style="s2">answers as the tyrant and so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.439" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">need for your thinking and you might be</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.989" end="00:38:05.910" style="s2">saying well my life isn&#39;t going as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:08.069" style="s2">as it could and the tyrant says well you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.910" end="00:38:11.069" style="s2">don&#39;t get to think that because in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.069" end="00:38:13.679" style="s2">utopian tyranny everything&#39;s perfect and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.069" end="00:38:16.709" style="s2">if you&#39;re suffering that means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.679" end="00:38:18.809" style="s2">politically suspect because you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.809" end="00:38:23.219" style="s2">that the Utopia has already manifested</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:25.349" style="s2">itself your unhappiness is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.219" end="00:38:26.789" style="s2">political crime but if you just keep it</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.349" end="00:38:30.599" style="s2">to yourself well we&#39;ll let you keep your</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.789" end="00:38:33.630" style="s2">head but if you have the the if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.599" end="00:38:36.599" style="s2">driven to the extreme where you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.630" end="00:38:38.189" style="s2">express the fact that you&#39;re unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.599" end="00:38:40.890" style="s2">perhaps that your child doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.189" end="00:38:43.349" style="s2">enough to eat then it&#39;s off to the gulag</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.890" end="00:38:45.900" style="s2">with you and all your family as well</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.349" end="00:38:47.880" style="s2">because there&#39;ll be no thinking here and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.900" end="00:38:50.670" style="s2">even if there is they&#39;ll certainly be no</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.880" end="00:38:53.369" style="s2">talking you sound here&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.670" end="00:38:56.279" style="s2">happened recently in Venezuela this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.369" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">worth thinking about for all the people</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.279" end="00:39:02.359" style="s2">who Harbor collectivist utopian dreams</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:04.769" style="s2">Venezuela the Venezuelan government</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.359" end="00:39:07.650" style="s2">about two months ago this was reported</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.769" end="00:39:08.969" style="s2">in The New York Times which is not a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.650" end="00:39:11.420" style="s2">newspaper I would say that would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.969" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">intrinsically biased against Venezuela</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.420" end="00:39:17.670" style="s2">said that it was now illegal to diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:20.869" style="s2">the cause of a child&#39;s death in a</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.869" end="00:39:26.239" style="s2">because the Venezuelans Venezuelan</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.849" end="00:39:29.429" style="s2">government&#39;s answer to the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.239" end="00:39:33.569" style="s2">children starving was to make it illegal</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.429" end="00:39:35.609" style="s2">to notice it in hospitals and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.569" end="00:39:37.589" style="s2">tyranny right that&#39;s a place where</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.609" end="00:39:41.099" style="s2">thought is not allowed that&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.589" end="00:39:42.150" style="s2">where free speech is not allowed so it</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.099" end="00:39:44.849" style="s2">seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.150" end="00:39:47.220" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good place to go to say the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.849" end="00:39:50.279" style="s2">least and we&#39;ve gone there many times in</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.220" end="00:39:51.660" style="s2">the last hundred and fifty years and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.279" end="00:39:53.279" style="s2">should perhaps think very hard about</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.660" end="00:39:57.059" style="s2">whether or not we ever want to go there</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.279" end="00:39:59.369" style="s2">again the first rule in twelve rules for</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.059" end="00:40:01.710" style="s2">life is stand up straight with your</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.369" end="00:40:04.109" style="s2">shoulders back and I want to tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.710" end="00:40:06.749" style="s2">little bit about the world in which that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.109" end="00:40:09.720" style="s2">rule applies and it&#39;s our world but it</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.749" end="00:40:11.249" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily the world that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.720" end="00:40:13.980" style="s2">think of when you think of our world</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.249" end="00:40:15.480" style="s2">although it&#39;s the world you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.980" end="00:40:17.460" style="s2">funny because it&#39;s a world you know but</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.480" end="00:40:19.079" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you know it it&#39;s a world</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.460" end="00:40:21.509" style="s2">that presents itself to you in literary</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.079" end="00:40:24.269" style="s2">form and in mythological form and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.509" end="00:40:27.390" style="s2">symbolic form and you all understand it</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.269" end="00:40:29.190" style="s2">but you you can&#39;t articulate it but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.390" end="00:40:32.789" style="s2">can articulate some of it how many of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.190" end="00:40:35.400" style="s2">you have seen the Lion King okay how</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.789" end="00:40:36.809" style="s2">many of you haven&#39;t okay so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.400" end="00:40:37.980" style="s2">better question hardly you guys should</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.809" end="00:40:40.859" style="s2">see The Lion King because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.980" end="00:40:42.930" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with you so so</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.859" end="00:40:44.730" style="s2">and in any ways I want to tell you about</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.930" end="00:40:46.140" style="s2">the world of The Lion King now one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.730" end="00:40:48.569" style="s2">the things I want you to notice is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.140" end="00:40:49.799" style="s2">when you go see that movie or when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.569" end="00:40:52.170" style="s2">show it to your kids when you watch it</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.799" end="00:40:54.539" style="s2">at home I don&#39;t care what you fall into</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.170" end="00:40:56.489" style="s2">it and that&#39;s very strange because first</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.539" end="00:40:58.859" style="s2">of all it&#39;s not a world it&#39;s drawings</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.489" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">right it&#39;s animated drawings of a world</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.859" end="00:41:02.279" style="s2">it&#39;s very low resolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:04.950" style="s2">creatures aren&#39;t human they&#39;re animals</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.279" end="00:41:07.559" style="s2">you&#39;ve all noticed that no doubt and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.950" end="00:41:09.539" style="s2">world is magical because things happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.559" end="00:41:11.160" style="s2">in it that aren&#39;t the sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.539" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">that obviously happen in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.160" end="00:41:14.970" style="s2">but you don&#39;t care about any of that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:17.339" style="s2">don&#39;t care that the animals talk you</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.970" end="00:41:19.499" style="s2">don&#39;t care that the Lions or Kings all</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.339" end="00:41:21.509" style="s2">of that makes perfect sense to you and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.499" end="00:41:25.109" style="s2">that means that which is a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.509" end="00:41:26.940" style="s2">thing which it means that the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.109" end="00:41:28.619" style="s2">which the characters are represented and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.940" end="00:41:31.019" style="s2">the world that they inhabit is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.619" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">familiar to you because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.019" end="00:41:34.799" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t fall into it and you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:36.749" style="s2">even and you&#39;d notice that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.799" end="00:41:38.609" style="s2">doing is so strange because it really is</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.749" end="00:41:41.730" style="s2">so strange so imagine the opening of The</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.609" end="00:41:43.980" style="s2">Lion King so what happens is that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.730" end="00:41:45.960" style="s2">camera pans over the great African plain</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.980" end="00:41:47.249" style="s2">and you see all the animals gathering</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.960" end="00:41:49.380" style="s2">right they&#39;re all coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.249" end="00:41:51.779" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of thrilling black</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.380" end="00:41:54.539" style="s2">gospel music going on in the background</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.779" end="00:41:55.950" style="s2">with an African beat and so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.539" end="00:41:59.700" style="s2">really well done the opening of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.950" end="00:42:02.370" style="s2">movie and then you the camera pans up</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.700" end="00:42:05.130" style="s2">like like it&#39;s revealing something and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.370" end="00:42:07.770" style="s2">you see this structure that&#39;s known in</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.130" end="00:42:10.740" style="s2">the movie as Pride Rock and so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.770" end="00:42:12.420" style="s2">structure that rises up above the plane</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.740" end="00:42:13.740" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s shaped like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.420" end="00:42:15.480" style="s2">mountain essentially although it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.740" end="00:42:18.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just a rock but it&#39;s it&#39;s a high</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.480" end="00:42:20.520" style="s2">place it&#39;s a place that you can that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.510" end="00:42:22.410" style="s2">can view everything from right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.520" end="00:42:23.940" style="s2">place that it&#39;s a place from which you</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.410" end="00:42:26.910" style="s2">can get an overview it&#39;s a place from</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.940" end="00:42:29.340" style="s2">which you can see and you&#39;re introduced</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.910" end="00:42:31.170" style="s2">to the Kings little bird whose name I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.340" end="00:42:33.030" style="s2">don&#39;t remember at the moment and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.170" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">the eyes of the King and so the king is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.030" end="00:42:36.900" style="s2">obviously something that has eyes</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:39.090" style="s2">because he has a bird and the bird can</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.900" end="00:42:40.650" style="s2">fly around from up above and see</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.090" end="00:42:42.810" style="s2">everything in report to him so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.650" end="00:42:46.260" style="s2">the king is is associated with the bird</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.810" end="00:42:48.990" style="s2">just like Horus the ancient Egyptian God</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.260" end="00:42:49.950" style="s2">was associated with a Falken in fact for</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.990" end="00:42:51.480" style="s2">exactly that reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.950" end="00:42:53.550" style="s2">Falcons can see better than any other</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.480" end="00:42:54.990" style="s2">creature by the way better even than</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.550" end="00:42:57.270" style="s2">human beings and we have very good</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.990" end="00:42:59.640" style="s2">eyesight so the king is the creature who</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.270" end="00:43:01.530" style="s2">can see and the king is a lion and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.640" end="00:43:02.820" style="s2">reason the Lions a king is because the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.530" end="00:43:04.680" style="s2">Lions at the top of the food chain</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.820" end="00:43:06.630" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it but the lion is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.680" end="00:43:08.940" style="s2">solar beast he has a mane he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.630" end="00:43:10.830" style="s2">associated with the Sun he&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.940" end="00:43:12.990" style="s2">with the daytime he&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.830" end="00:43:15.570" style="s2">power and majesty and strength and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.990" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">not a mouse that&#39;s king right it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.570" end="00:43:20.490" style="s2">rat it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a lion and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:22.680" style="s2">think well obviously the lion is king</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.490" end="00:43:24.750" style="s2">you know everyone knows that even though</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.680" end="00:43:26.610" style="s2">animals don&#39;t have Kings in case you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.750" end="00:43:28.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t notice so it&#39;s not self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.610" end="00:43:32.790" style="s2">that it should be the lion and then the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.740" end="00:43:34.440" style="s2">lion is on the rock in the Sun right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.790" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">the rock sticks up above everything else</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.440" end="00:43:40.950" style="s2">and the lion is there and the lion is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:43.320" style="s2">paternal lion and he has a mate and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.950" end="00:43:46.050" style="s2">scene opens with them giving birth and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.320" end="00:43:48.570" style="s2">so it&#39;s a nativity scene and so and</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.050" end="00:43:50.910" style="s2">that&#39;s painfully obvious if you watch it</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.570" end="00:43:54.120" style="s2">with a little bit of detachment it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.910" end="00:43:58.980" style="s2">Tivoli scene and Rafiki who&#39;s the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.120" end="00:44:02.100" style="s2">priest lifts up the new Messiah to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.980" end="00:44:04.440" style="s2">Sun and when that happens the music</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.100" end="00:44:07.230" style="s2">swells and all of the animals go down on</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.440" end="00:44:09.750" style="s2">their knees and it&#39;s a very and then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.230" end="00:44:12.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a drumbeat and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.750" end="00:44:15.270" style="s2">the the the words the Lion King come up</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.510" end="00:44:17.570" style="s2">on stage and it&#39;s beautifully done it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.270" end="00:44:20.430" style="s2">beautifully done they they pan up to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.570" end="00:44:23.400" style="s2">revelation of the lion cub to the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.430" end="00:44:25.770" style="s2">two or three times and it&#39;s really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.400" end="00:44:27.390" style="s2">a really emotional moment and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.770" end="00:44:30.030" style="s2">because all these levels of symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.390" end="00:44:32.760" style="s2">lock in at the same time you have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.030" end="00:44:34.470" style="s2">the environment the field where all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.760" end="00:44:36.690" style="s2">animals gather so all the animals are</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.470" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">gathering to review the revelation of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.690" end="00:44:41.670" style="s2">something transcendent and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:44.970" style="s2">revelation of what&#39;s transcendent is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.670" end="00:44:47.640" style="s2">birth of the new hero to the king and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.970" end="00:44:49.830" style="s2">queen on the rock above the plain and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.640" end="00:44:52.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a universal truth in that which</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.830" end="00:44:54.990" style="s2">is why the animators worked as hard as</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.380" end="00:44:56.550" style="s2">they did to make that scene and why it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.990" end="00:44:58.619" style="s2">opens what was one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.550" end="00:45:02.369" style="s2">spectacular ly successful movies of all</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.619" end="00:45:05.340" style="s2">time and the the way the filmmakers do</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.369" end="00:45:08.790" style="s2">it is when Rafiki holds up the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.340" end="00:45:11.430" style="s2">infant Simba the clouds break and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.790" end="00:45:13.619" style="s2">Sun shines on and that&#39;s the culminating</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.430" end="00:45:16.650" style="s2">moment and that&#39;s the revelation of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.619" end="00:45:19.740" style="s2">identity of the newborn hero with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.650" end="00:45:22.140" style="s2">consciousness of the Sun and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.740" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">light creatures where day time creatures</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.140" end="00:45:27.180" style="s2">were visual creatures right we&#39;re not we</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:29.070" style="s2">don&#39;t we&#39;re not nocturnal the night is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.180" end="00:45:32.460" style="s2">when we&#39;re unconscious the day is when</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.070" end="00:45:35.220" style="s2">we&#39;re conscious and the terminology that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.460" end="00:45:36.980" style="s2">we use that&#39;s associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.220" end="00:45:39.599" style="s2">furtherance of our consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.980" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">illumination and enlightenment and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.599" end="00:45:44.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a tight relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.420" end="00:45:48.440" style="s2">waking up and letting the light shine in</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.550" end="00:45:52.020" style="s2">and developing in consciousness and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.440" end="00:45:55.830" style="s2">association between the Rays of the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.020" end="00:45:57.900" style="s2">and the lifting up of the infant is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.830" end="00:46:00.180" style="s2">Association the ancient association</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.900" end="00:46:03.210" style="s2">between the hero who defeats the forces</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.180" end="00:46:06.420" style="s2">of darkness and the Sun itself and you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.210" end="00:46:08.730" style="s2">all know all of that which is why that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.420" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">opening works and why it sets the scene</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.730" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">for the rest of the movie and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:15.540" style="s2">rest of the movie well we could think</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:18.540" style="s2">about the landscape first of all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.540" end="00:46:20.849" style="s2">a scene where Simba&#39;s father takes him</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.540" end="00:46:22.619" style="s2">up on top of Pride Rock and tells him</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.849" end="00:46:23.690" style="s2">that his kingdom that he&#39;s the king and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.619" end="00:46:27.020" style="s2">that his kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.690" end="00:46:29.690" style="s2">extends as far as the light touches so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.020" end="00:46:32.030" style="s2">the landscape is a place with a pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.690" end="00:46:34.190" style="s2">in it there at the top of the pyramid on</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.030" end="00:46:36.140" style="s2">a plane that&#39;s circumscribed by the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.190" end="00:46:40.130" style="s2">light and outside the light is darkness</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.140" end="00:46:43.609" style="s2">and so the the mythological landscape in</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.130" end="00:46:45.950" style="s2">which this story reveals itself is light</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.609" end="00:46:48.200" style="s2">versus darkness or order versus chaos</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.950" end="00:46:52.250" style="s2">and the reason for that is because that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.200" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">is our landscape we inhabit pyramidal</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.250" end="00:46:56.810" style="s2">structures those are hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:58.609" style="s2">other hierarchies I think in our society</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.810" end="00:47:02.060" style="s2">those are mostly hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.609" end="00:47:05.329" style="s2">competence we we we inhabit hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.060" end="00:47:08.569" style="s2">structures on a plane that&#39;s defied</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.329" end="00:47:11.390" style="s2">defined by our understanding surrounded</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.569" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">by what we do not comprehend and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.390" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">the universal human world and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:22.010" style="s2">hierarchy itself is a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:23.690" style="s2">structure that enables us to live with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.010" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">certain amount of peace and productivity</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.690" end="00:47:31.369" style="s2">together and also to establish a value</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.880" end="00:48:11.119" style="s2">that there&#39;s no hierarchy that&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.549" end="00:48:58.039" style="s2">world something to think about very</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.029" end="00:49:00.430" style="s2">seriously well the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.039" end="00:49:02.989" style="s2">that this estate is always threatened by</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.430" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">malevolence always the hierarchy can</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.989" end="00:49:08.539" style="s2">always become corrupt and tyrannical and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:10.489" style="s2">that those the the forces of malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.539" end="00:49:13.519" style="s2">let&#39;s say that are conspiring behind the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.489" end="00:49:17.119" style="s2">scenes tend to tilt every hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.519" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">towards tyranny and the proper attitude</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.119" end="00:49:22.789" style="s2">to take towards that universal truth is</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:26.989" style="s2">to stay in the light and keep your damn</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.789" end="00:49:29.410" style="s2">eyes open and so well what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.989" end="00:49:32.180" style="s2">the lion king is that the evil brother</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.410" end="00:49:34.910" style="s2">overthrows the rightful king and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.180" end="00:49:37.009" style="s2">again is an unbelievably common idea you</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.910" end="00:49:38.930" style="s2">see that idea echo throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.009" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">mythological landscape for centuries and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.930" end="00:49:43.130" style="s2">the reason for that is it happens all</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">the time that&#39;s what happened in Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.130" end="00:49:47.779" style="s2">Germany that&#39;s what&#39;s happened in most</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:50.019" style="s2">of the tyrannical societies of the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.779" end="00:49:52.579" style="s2">and most societies in the world are</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.019" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">tyrannical there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.579" end="00:49:55.970" style="s2">possibility that the hierarchies that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:57.890" style="s2">live in will become corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.970" end="00:50:00.470" style="s2">counterproductive and there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.890" end="00:50:02.150" style="s2">reasons for that but they&#39;re summed up</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.470" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">in the malevolence of the arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.150" end="00:50:06.039" style="s2">intellect it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:08.690" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s a very common idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.039" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the character of Milton&#39;s Satan</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.690" end="00:50:13.819" style="s2">by the way because he&#39;s the ultimate in</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:15.739" style="s2">arrogant intellect Milton Satan is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.819" end="00:50:17.930" style="s2">figure who believes that his knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.739" end="00:50:21.170" style="s2">is sufficient to do without the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.930" end="00:50:22.789" style="s2">transcendent to do without the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.170" end="00:50:25.279" style="s2">there&#39;s something beyond or that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.789" end="00:50:27.650" style="s2">still something to learn all I know is</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.279" end="00:50:32.930" style="s2">all that I need to know which is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.650" end="00:50:36.849" style="s2">the belief of the fundamental tyrant the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.930" end="00:50:39.710" style="s2">evil brother of the King kills the king</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.849" end="00:50:42.019" style="s2">Simba loses his father well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.710" end="00:50:43.789" style="s2">another common idea because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.019" end="00:50:45.890" style="s2">loses their father in some sense people</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.789" end="00:50:48.019" style="s2">grow up and become cynical as teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.890" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">and the reason they become cynical as</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.019" end="00:50:53.140" style="s2">teenagers is because they see that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:54.940" style="s2">corruption of the state is sufficient to</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.140" end="00:50:56.829" style="s2">undermine their confidence in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.940" end="00:50:58.779" style="s2">benevolence of the state and they get</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.829" end="00:50:59.739" style="s2">cynical prematurely because what the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.779" end="00:51:02.140" style="s2">hell do you know when you&#39;re a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.739" end="00:51:04.119" style="s2">but you&#39;re encouraged in your cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.140" end="00:51:06.940" style="s2">frequently in our culture which is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.119" end="00:51:09.729" style="s2">very bad idea no I mean even though it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.940" end="00:51:12.279" style="s2">is the case that the structure is always</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.729" end="00:51:15.640" style="s2">threatened by malevolence let&#39;s say an</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.279" end="00:51:19.089" style="s2">inhuman weakness Simba ends up</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.640" end="00:51:22.180" style="s2">fatherless and lost and alienated from</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.089" end="00:51:24.579" style="s2">his kingdom just like King Arthur it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.180" end="00:51:27.309" style="s2">the same story the king is often the</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.579" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">rightful king is often dissociated from</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.309" end="00:51:31.690" style="s2">his kingdom and forced to occupy a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:33.910" style="s2">domain that&#39;s outside the kingdom and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.690" end="00:51:38.109" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens to Simba he loses</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.910" end="00:51:40.479" style="s2">his father and what happens he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.109" end="00:51:44.469" style="s2">adopts the lifestyle of an impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.479" end="00:51:46.989" style="s2">adolescent that&#39;s what happens and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.469" end="00:51:50.920" style="s2">he&#39;s out there in no-man&#39;s land with his</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.989" end="00:51:53.349" style="s2">useless teenage friends doing nothing of</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.349" end="00:51:59.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s the nihilistic retreat from</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.680" end="00:52:01.059" style="s2">the corrupt state and no wonder and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.170" end="00:52:03.369" style="s2">might say well if the state is corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.059" end="00:52:05.380" style="s2">why should I participate in its</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.369" end="00:52:07.509" style="s2">maintenance why should I do anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.380" end="00:52:09.069" style="s2">that&#39;s useful if all I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.509" end="00:52:12.190" style="s2">furthering the development of a corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.069" end="00:52:15.940" style="s2">state and I would say the message in the</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.700" end="00:55:27.130" style="s2">outlived its utility and but his father</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.550" end="00:55:29.260" style="s2">has a very set face which means he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.130" end="00:55:31.720" style="s2">integrated his aggression and he sees</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.080" end="00:56:30.550" style="s2">appeal to a very large number of people</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.869" end="00:56:31.390" style="s2">given the popularity of that movie and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.550" end="00:56:34.119" style="s2">what is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.390" end="00:56:36.970" style="s2">what&#39;s a call to responsibility it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:56:36.970" end="00:56:42.369" style="s2">is that it is the case that we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.750" end="00:56:44.890" style="s2">field that&#39;s defined by the extent of</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.270" end="00:56:54.340" style="s2">kingship at the top it is the case that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.300" end="00:56:56.980" style="s2">that&#39;s always threatened by malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.340" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">and sin it is the case that that can</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.980" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">make you corrupt and cynical and</p>

<p begin="00:57:01.359" end="00:57:07.840" style="s2">the inappropriate response and that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.190" end="00:57:38.290" style="s2">that we can watch that movie without</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:40.630" style="s2">understanding it right you can fall into</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.290" end="00:57:42.370" style="s2">it because you do when you go to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.630" end="00:57:44.620" style="s2">might wonder well do people have</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.370" end="00:57:47.110" style="s2">religious experiences because people</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.620" end="00:57:49.720" style="s2">wonder about the truth of religion let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.110" end="00:57:51.280" style="s2">say and I&#39;m not going to go very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.720" end="00:57:53.110" style="s2">into that issue but I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.280" end="00:57:56.140" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing when you go to a movie</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.110" end="00:57:59.290" style="s2">like that that has that mythological</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.140" end="00:58:01.480" style="s2">structure and you fall into it which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.290" end="00:58:03.130" style="s2">what you do that what you&#39;re having is</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.480" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">absolutely indistinguishable from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.130" end="00:58:07.450" style="s2">religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:09.490" style="s2">it&#39;s the revelation of knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.450" end="00:58:11.590" style="s2">you know but you don&#39;t know you know and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.490" end="00:58:14.560" style="s2">there&#39;s something about it that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.590" end="00:58:17.110" style="s2">deeply engaging and meaningful that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.560" end="00:58:19.600" style="s2">will line up and pay for the privilege</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.110" end="00:58:21.550" style="s2">of being exposed to it and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.600" end="00:58:24.310" style="s2">an easy thing to understand like if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.550" end="00:58:25.780" style="s2">bring your child will be very excited</p>

<p begin="00:58:37.120" end="00:58:41.950" style="s2">four or five years old he just watched</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.250" end="00:58:43.570" style="s2">it over and over and over and over I</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.950" end="00:58:45.940" style="s2">thought what the hell are you doing kid</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.570" end="00:58:48.400" style="s2">you know I mean it was so interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.940" end="00:58:49.750" style="s2">watch that he was so obsessed by it but</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.400" end="00:58:52.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.750" end="00:58:54.400" style="s2">information in that movie like an almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.090" end="00:58:57.370" style="s2">unlimited amount of information and he</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.400" end="00:58:59.950" style="s2">was gripped by it and was trying however</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.370" end="00:59:02.830" style="s2">it is that a child&#39;s imagination tries</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.950" end="00:59:04.420" style="s2">to come to terms with what the movie was</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.830" end="00:59:07.480" style="s2">representing and it wasn&#39;t like he</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.420" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">enjoyed it not at all not in the least</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.480" end="00:59:11.080" style="s2">you know and if you well if you if you</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.080" end="00:59:15.960" style="s2">seen the movie Pinocchio okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.450" end="00:59:18.100" style="s2">the same thing it&#39;s one of the 10 most</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.960" end="00:59:21.070" style="s2">highest-grossing movies of all time by</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.100" end="00:59:22.690" style="s2">the way there&#39;s a scene where Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.070" end="00:59:25.090" style="s2">who&#39;s turned in he&#39;s a wooden puppet</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.560" end="00:59:31.960" style="s2">you and apparently does and he goes to</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:33.490" style="s2">the bottom of the ocean to rescue his</p>

<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">perfectly okay with that right so so</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.720" end="00:59:53.480" style="s2">it&#39;s very peculiar and so and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:54.920" style="s2">frightening like the whale is a well it</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.480" end="00:59:58.820" style="s2">does breathe fire because it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.920" end="01:00:01.760" style="s2">a dragon not a whale and and they the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.820" end="01:00:05.150" style="s2">animators used locomotive noises to to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.760" end="01:00:07.310" style="s2">to add the audio background and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.150" end="01:00:09.410" style="s2">whale is hell-bent on destroying the</p>

<p begin="01:00:09.410" end="01:00:14.780" style="s2">Geppetto and it&#39;s a very tense scene and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.320" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">so my son was just like this like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.780" end="01:00:18.470" style="s2">whole time watching it wasn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:20.510" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t think that he would you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.470" end="01:00:22.760" style="s2">he&#39;s like these terrified like a rabbit</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.510" end="01:00:24.410" style="s2">who&#39;s being watched by a wolf and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.760" end="01:00:26.690" style="s2">it makes his heart beat and he&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.410" end="01:00:28.130" style="s2">exhausted and it goes and then the first</p>

<p begin="01:00:41.870" end="01:00:45.770" style="s2">seen a thousand things like that and at</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.180" end="01:00:47.270" style="s2">least in principle you&#39;re little tougher</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.770" end="01:00:49.220" style="s2">and a little wiser but when you&#39;re four</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.270" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">that just blows you away like like</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.220" end="01:00:53.090" style="s2">everything in the world does and yet all</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:54.500" style="s2">he would do is expose himself to it over</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.090" end="01:00:56.840" style="s2">and over and over and over and over and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.500" end="01:00:58.250" style="s2">in the Lion King like if you watch</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.840" end="01:01:00.830" style="s2">children when they go see that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.250" end="01:01:03.380" style="s2">just demolished when Simba&#39;s father dies</p>

<p begin="01:01:08.960" end="01:01:13.190" style="s2">over and over and over and over just</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.150" end="01:01:15.620" style="s2">like you do and it&#39;s because well the</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.190" end="01:01:17.540" style="s2">whole story we used to tell her son when</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.620" end="01:01:19.340" style="s2">we took him to movies because he&#39;d get</p>

<p begin="01:01:19.340" end="01:01:26.450" style="s2">and unsurprisingly watch the hero keep</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.080" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">your eye on the hero because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.450" end="01:01:30.920" style="s2">pathway through and that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:33.800" style="s2">because you&#39;re supposed to keep your eye</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.920" end="01:01:36.350" style="s2">on the hero because that is the pathway</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.800" end="01:01:39.820" style="s2">through and there isn&#39;t anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.350" end="01:01:42.850" style="s2">more true than that that&#39;s a true story</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.820" end="01:01:45.970" style="s2">you think well it&#39;s fictional it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.850" end="01:01:48.950" style="s2">fiction presents abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.970" end="01:01:53.090" style="s2">abstractions aren&#39;t falsehoods they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.950" end="01:01:55.070" style="s2">abstractions think about numbers numbers</p>

<p begin="01:01:58.040" end="01:02:02.860" style="s2">but if you know the numbers you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.110" end="01:02:05.540" style="s2">abstractions of tremendous truth</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.860" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">well the abstraction of the idea of the</p>

<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:14.300" style="s2">human action is the abstraction of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.000" end="01:02:16.460" style="s2">it&#39;s more true than true deep fiction is</p>

<p begin="01:02:18.560" end="01:02:23.450" style="s2">reality itself in the same way that an</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.110" end="01:02:26.690" style="s2">abstraction can be more real than the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.450" end="01:02:30.410" style="s2">thing that it&#39;s abstracted from all of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.690" end="01:02:32.990" style="s2">the all of the landscape in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.410" end="01:02:36.980" style="s2">mythological tale like The Lion King is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.990" end="01:02:40.340" style="s2">an abstract landscape what&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.980" end="01:02:41.980" style="s2">across all landscapes well wherever you</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.340" end="01:02:44.350" style="s2">go there are things that you know and</p>

<p begin="01:02:52.850" end="01:02:57.770" style="s2">because your knowledge is still bounded</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.920" end="01:02:59.510" style="s2">by your limitless ignorance and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.770" end="01:03:02.540" style="s2">possibility that that domain of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.510" end="01:03:04.490" style="s2">limitless ignorance will make mockery of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.540" end="01:03:07.970" style="s2">what you know at any moment it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.490" end="01:03:11.030" style="s2">reality and it&#39;s a universal reality and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.970" end="01:03:15.530" style="s2">you have to orient yourself in that</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.030" end="01:03:17.000" style="s2">landscape and so does everyone else you</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.530" end="01:03:19.010" style="s2">have to deal with what you know and what</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.000" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t know everywhere and the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.010" end="01:03:22.760" style="s2">you do that is by straddling the divide</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.200" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">between what you know and what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.760" end="01:03:28.430" style="s2">know you do that by staying firmly</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:30.020" style="s2">grounded to some degree in what you</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.430" end="01:03:32.210" style="s2">understand but by putting a tentative</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.020" end="01:03:34.490" style="s2">foot outward into what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.210" end="01:03:36.230" style="s2">understand so that you can remain stable</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.490" end="01:03:39.320" style="s2">but you can stretch yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.230" end="01:03:41.120" style="s2">challenge yourself simultaneously right</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.320" end="01:03:42.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s the proper place to stand and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.120" end="01:03:45.110" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a real place that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.860" end="01:03:48.560" style="s2">line between chaos and order and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.110" end="01:03:50.690" style="s2">the place of meaning rule 6 again rule 7</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.560" end="01:03:52.760" style="s2">is do what is meaningful not what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.690" end="01:03:55.940" style="s2">expedient and when you do what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.760" end="01:03:59.030" style="s2">meaningful you stay in the kingdom that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.940" end="01:04:01.310" style="s2">you&#39;ve established but you don&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.030" end="01:04:03.800" style="s2">completely in it because you need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.310" end="01:04:08.510" style="s2">challenge yourself and grow and so you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.800" end="01:04:11.569" style="s2">put one foot tentatively out into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.510" end="01:04:14.029" style="s2">domain that supersedes your competence</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.569" end="01:04:15.890" style="s2">and you maintain stability and grow at</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.029" end="01:04:20.799" style="s2">the same time and when you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.890" end="01:04:24.709" style="s2">properly then the psychological</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:27.709" style="s2">consequence of that is the immersed in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.709" end="01:04:30.650" style="s2">meaningful experience it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.709" end="01:04:31.819" style="s2">instinct so when you know if you watch</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.650" end="01:04:33.380" style="s2">yourself you say well I had a</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.819" end="01:04:36.920" style="s2">particularly good day at work</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.380" end="01:04:40.430" style="s2">and what does that mean well it means</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.920" end="01:04:41.539" style="s2">that you lost your sense of time right</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.430" end="01:04:43.999" style="s2">because when you&#39;re having not a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.539" end="01:04:48.859" style="s2">day at work it&#39;s like first it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.999" end="01:04:50.930" style="s2">minute to three and then it&#39;s 45 seconds</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.859" end="01:04:54.549" style="s2">to three and then it&#39;s 30 seconds that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.930" end="01:04:59.229" style="s2">what school was like for me it was like</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.549" end="01:05:02.539" style="s2">clique so funny you know I went to I</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.229" end="01:05:03.949" style="s2">went to my daughter&#39;s school I used to</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.949" end="01:05:10.789" style="s2">surprise surprise when I was a kid and</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.239" end="01:05:13.819" style="s2">and I was bored stiff in school and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.789" end="01:05:19.670" style="s2">so I would misbehave upon occasion out</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.819" end="01:05:24.229" style="s2">of pure boredom and about 21 years ago I</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.670" end="01:05:27.859" style="s2">went to my daughter&#39;s school to sit for</p>

<p begin="01:05:39.650" end="01:05:43.609" style="s2">the same experience I was sitting there</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.479" end="01:05:44.989" style="s2">it was like being it&#39;s like being seven</p>

<p begin="01:06:54.010" end="01:06:57.220" style="s2">think and you have to know how to read</p>

<p begin="01:06:59.320" end="01:07:02.650" style="s2">to be willing to hoist the troubles of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.210" end="01:07:05.020" style="s2">the world up on your shoulders and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.650" end="01:07:07.060" style="s2">what&#39;s so interesting about that so</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.020" end="01:07:09.400" style="s2">remarkable and and this is something</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.060" end="01:07:10.810" style="s2">that&#39;s really manifested itself to me as</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.400" end="01:07:12.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing these public lectures</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.810" end="01:07:14.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.010" end="01:07:16.540" style="s2">to people which doesn&#39;t seem to happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.050" end="01:07:19.450" style="s2">very often anymore and the audiences are</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.540" end="01:07:22.270" style="s2">dead quiet and I lay out this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.450" end="01:07:24.070" style="s2">life is tragedy tainted by malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.270" end="01:07:26.020" style="s2">and everyone says yeah well we already</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.070" end="01:07:27.910" style="s2">always suspected that but no one has</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.020" end="01:07:29.980" style="s2">ever said it quite so bluntly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.910" end="01:07:32.560" style="s2">quite a relief to hear that I&#39;m not the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.980" end="01:07:34.720" style="s2">only person who has those suspicions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.560" end="01:07:36.640" style="s2">then the second part of that is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.720" end="01:07:40.750" style="s2">better part and it&#39;s the optimistic part</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.640" end="01:07:43.570" style="s2">which is despite the fact that life is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.750" end="01:07:45.580" style="s2">tragedy tainted by malevolence at every</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.570" end="01:07:47.830" style="s2">level of existence there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.580" end="01:07:51.040" style="s2">about the human spirit that can thrive</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.830" end="01:07:53.620" style="s2">under precisely those conditions if we</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.040" end="01:07:56.790" style="s2">allow that to occur because as difficult</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.620" end="01:07:59.860" style="s2">as life is and as horrible as we are our</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.790" end="01:08:03.040" style="s2">capacity to deal with that catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.860" end="01:08:05.740" style="s2">and to transcend that malevolent spirit</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.040" end="01:08:08.260" style="s2">is more powerful than than that reality</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.740" end="01:08:11.320" style="s2">itself and that&#39;s the fundamental issue</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.260" end="01:08:13.480" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the fundamental issue of</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.320" end="01:08:15.070" style="s2">the judeo-christian ethic with its</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.480" end="01:08:18.250" style="s2">emphasis on the divinity of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.070" end="01:08:20.890" style="s2">individual as catastrophic as life is</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.250" end="01:08:24.210" style="s2">and as malevolent as people can be and</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.890" end="01:08:28.690" style="s2">that&#39;s malevolent beyond belief</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.210" end="01:08:31.510" style="s2">fundamentally the person has in spirit</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.690" end="01:08:34.690" style="s2">the nobility to set that right and to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.510" end="01:08:37.240" style="s2">defeat evil and that and that more than</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.690" end="01:08:39.310" style="s2">that and that the antidote to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.240" end="01:08:41.380" style="s2">catastrophe of life and the suffering</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.310" end="01:08:43.780" style="s2">life and the tragedy of life that can</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.380" end="01:08:46.180" style="s2">drive you down and destroy you is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.780" end="01:08:48.940" style="s2">take on exactly that responsibility and</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.180" end="01:08:50.680" style="s2">to say well there&#39;s plenty of work to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.940" end="01:08:53.680" style="s2">done and isn&#39;t that terrible</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.680" end="01:08:56.260" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t anything so bad that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.680" end="01:08:58.839" style="s2">can&#39;t make it worse and certainly try</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.260" end="01:09:01.810" style="s2">very hard to do so but I have it within</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.839" end="01:09:03.370" style="s2">me to decide that I&#39;m going to stand up</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.810" end="01:09:05.080" style="s2">against that I&#39;m going to strive to make</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.370" end="01:09:07.150" style="s2">the world a better place I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.080" end="01:09:09.010" style="s2">strive to constrain the malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.150" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">that&#39;s in my own heart and to set my</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.010" end="01:09:14.530" style="s2">family straight and to work to work</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:16.420" style="s2">despite my tragic loss for the</p>

<p begin="01:09:16.420" end="01:09:20.350" style="s2">that&#39;s in front of me and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.160" end="01:09:22.510" style="s2">consequence of that the immediate</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.350" end="01:09:25.240" style="s2">consequence of that is that when you</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.510" end="01:09:27.400" style="s2">make the decision to take on all of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.240" end="01:09:29.500" style="s2">voluntarily which is to stand up</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.400" end="01:09:31.870" style="s2">straight by the way with your shoulders</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.500" end="01:09:33.970" style="s2">back to take on that all that on</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.870" end="01:09:36.100" style="s2">voluntarily as soon as you make that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.970" end="01:09:38.760" style="s2">decision then all the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.100" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">justifies itself in the nobility of your</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.760" end="01:09:47.580" style="s2">striving and that&#39;s what it means to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:47.580" style="s2">an individual thank you</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.540" end="01:10:10.230" style="s2">this one this one is good the first one</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:14.160" style="s2">here what&#39;s your take on universal</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.230" end="01:10:17.310" style="s2">income is it a fast track to new</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.160" end="01:10:19.710" style="s2">communism capitalism killer or a</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.310" end="01:10:24.060" style="s2">possible way out of starvation for</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.710" end="01:10:27.810" style="s2">Humanity thank you well I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.060" end="01:10:31.350" style="s2">addresses the fundamental problem and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.810" end="01:10:34.770" style="s2">think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a mirror of</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.350" end="01:10:37.770" style="s2">the rights responsibility problem you</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.770" end="01:10:41.250" style="s2">know you might say well everyone has a</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.770" end="01:10:44.030" style="s2">right to the basics of life first of all</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.250" end="01:10:46.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a debatable proposition because</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.030" end="01:10:48.960" style="s2">the question is who&#39;s going to provide</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.440" end="01:10:50.580" style="s2">those necessities and the answer</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:56.010" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be someone else under</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.580" end="01:10:57.240" style="s2">compulsion so because each rate comes at</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.010" end="01:10:59.250" style="s2">the expense of someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.240" end="01:11:02.850" style="s2">responsibility and so you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.250" end="01:11:05.690" style="s2">multiply rights beyond minimum necessity</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.850" end="01:11:09.540" style="s2">because you also multiply diverse</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.690" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">responsibilities beyond tolerance but</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.540" end="01:11:15.930" style="s2">more importantly than that I would say</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:18.210" style="s2">is that let&#39;s make it more concrete so</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.930" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">let&#39;s imagine that as the technological</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.210" end="01:11:23.670" style="s2">revolution progresses more and more</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:26.160" style="s2">people will be in danger of being</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.670" end="01:11:27.600" style="s2">replaced by intelligent machines now we</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.160" end="01:11:29.970" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true because it</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.600" end="01:11:31.530" style="s2">hasn&#39;t happened yet right and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.970" end="01:11:33.480" style="s2">has been predicting that that was going</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.530" end="01:11:36.030" style="s2">to happen since like 1960 and it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.480" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">happened and so there may be an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.030" end="01:11:38.820" style="s2">amount of work and we&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">run out of work I suspect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.820" end="01:11:43.160" style="s2">probably the case but let&#39;s assume that</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:46.350" style="s2">people do get dispossessed as</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.160" end="01:11:48.510" style="s2">technologies transform and then we have</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.350" end="01:11:52.440" style="s2">the problem of the development of people</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.510" end="01:11:54.600" style="s2">for who have no viable means of making a</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.440" end="01:11:56.340" style="s2">living and the question might be well</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.600" end="01:11:58.350" style="s2">what&#39;s the fundamental problem there and</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.340" end="01:12:00.780" style="s2">one answer is well they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.350" end="01:12:03.420" style="s2">money but I actually don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.780" end="01:12:05.430" style="s2">that is the fundamental problem I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.420" end="01:12:08.760" style="s2">many people in my clinical practice who</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.430" end="01:12:10.290" style="s2">were unemployed and had money now they</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.760" end="01:12:13.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a lot of money but they had</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.290" end="01:12:14.100" style="s2">enough money and enough money to keep</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.560" end="01:12:16.230" style="s2">private</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.100" end="01:12:19.080" style="s2">at bay let&#39;s say an had enough money to</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.230" end="01:12:20.600" style="s2">well that was the rub enough money to</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.080" end="01:12:24.360" style="s2">get themselves into plenty of trouble</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.600" end="01:12:27.210" style="s2">and so one of my clients for example was</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.360" end="01:12:29.880" style="s2">a I liked him quite a lot and he had he</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.210" end="01:12:33.300" style="s2">was he had worked in a hospital and he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.880" end="01:12:35.340" style="s2">been hurt and and then he got onto</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.300" end="01:12:36.900" style="s2">painkillers because he&#39;d been hurt and</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.340" end="01:12:39.390" style="s2">then he got addicted to painkillers and</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.900" end="01:12:43.440" style="s2">then he got addicted to cocaine and his</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.390" end="01:12:44.940" style="s2">life took a bad nosedive and he is</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.440" end="01:12:48.030" style="s2">actually pretty good unless he had money</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.940" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">but as soon as he had a check it was he</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.030" end="01:12:53.400" style="s2">was gone he was in a ditch he was in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:55.020" style="s2">bar he spent all his money and he was</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.400" end="01:12:57.240" style="s2">facedown in the ditch and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.020" end="01:12:58.710" style="s2">he woke up the next day and and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.240" end="01:13:01.050" style="s2">reason I&#39;m telling you that story is</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.710" end="01:13:03.510" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.050" end="01:13:04.590" style="s2">money that wasn&#39;t the problem really the</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.510" end="01:13:06.750" style="s2">problem was that he didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.590" end="01:13:09.660" style="s2">purpose he didn&#39;t have a place anymore</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.750" end="01:13:11.900" style="s2">he got thrown out of the structure that</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.660" end="01:13:14.070" style="s2">would have enabled him to find</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.900" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">productive meaning you know and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.070" end="01:13:16.830" style="s2">might have said well he should have been</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:18.420" style="s2">able to conjure that up on his own and</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.830" end="01:13:20.090" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s the case although he</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.420" end="01:13:22.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the world&#39;s most sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.090" end="01:13:24.480" style="s2">person you know when people very</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.680" end="01:13:26.760" style="s2">substantially in their sophistication</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.480" end="01:13:28.260" style="s2">and and he didn&#39;t have a good family he</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.760" end="01:13:30.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a support network around him</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.260" end="01:13:32.250" style="s2">he was kind of a lost character in many</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.060" end="01:13:34.410" style="s2">many ways and so it was easy for him to</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.250" end="01:13:37.470" style="s2">fall out of the world which is what he</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.410" end="01:13:40.710" style="s2">did and providing him with money was not</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.470" end="01:13:43.770" style="s2">going to fix that what is what is going</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.710" end="01:13:46.980" style="s2">to fix that well that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.770" end="01:13:48.450" style="s2">I mean we we have a program you people</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.980" end="01:13:52.320" style="s2">some of you people might be interested</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.450" end="01:13:54.330" style="s2">in it it&#39;s called it&#39;s part of a suite</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.320" end="01:13:56.910" style="s2">of online writing programs called the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.330" end="01:13:58.290" style="s2">self authoring suite it&#39;s out self</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.910" end="01:14:01.920" style="s2">authoring com</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.290" end="01:14:04.140" style="s2">and one of the programs is called future</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.920" end="01:14:06.390" style="s2">authoring and we&#39;ve experimented with</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.140" end="01:14:11.010" style="s2">this program in an attempt to address</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.390" end="01:14:14.820" style="s2">this problem okay so I to you tonight</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.010" end="01:14:16.560" style="s2">the idea that we live out a story and we</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.820" end="01:14:18.540" style="s2">need a purpose to live out that story</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.560" end="01:14:20.820" style="s2">properly and what that implies is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.540" end="01:14:23.910" style="s2">you need a purpose you need a point you</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.820" end="01:14:27.580" style="s2">need a name you need a precise aim you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.910" end="01:14:30.230" style="s2">need a name that&#39;s of sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.580" end="01:14:32.570" style="s2">nobility I can&#39;t think of any other word</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.230" end="01:14:35.110" style="s2">sufficient nobility to justify your</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.570" end="01:14:38.900" style="s2">miserable existence even to yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.110" end="01:14:41.090" style="s2">you need to develop that aim and so we</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.900" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">built this program I started working on</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.090" end="01:14:46.160" style="s2">it about 15 years ago when I was giving</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:49.010" style="s2">my students exercises to do University</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.160" end="01:14:50.420" style="s2">and one of the exercises I had them do</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.010" end="01:14:53.270" style="s2">was that they had to pick a small</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.420" end="01:14:56.060" style="s2">problem maybe in their family or with</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.270" end="01:14:58.340" style="s2">their room and fix it not try to fix it</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.060" end="01:15:00.440" style="s2">you know but actually pick a problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.340" end="01:15:02.030" style="s2">that was small that they could fix clean</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.440" end="01:15:05.840" style="s2">up the cigarette butts in the yard</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.030" end="01:15:08.300" style="s2">outside the residence clean the room we</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.840" end="01:15:09.920" style="s2">had one kid whose mother had died and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.300" end="01:15:11.300" style="s2">the family got kind of fragmented and he</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.920" end="01:15:13.070" style="s2">decided that he was going to take over</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.300" end="01:15:14.810" style="s2">the maternal duties in the household and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.070" end="01:15:16.040" style="s2">kids were supposed to write about what</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.810" end="01:15:17.510" style="s2">happened when they tried to put this</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.040" end="01:15:19.220" style="s2">into practice because doing things like</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.510" end="01:15:21.320" style="s2">that is way more difficult than anybody</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.220" end="01:15:23.660" style="s2">ever realizes and so he tried to become</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.320" end="01:15:25.820" style="s2">mother and the family needed a mother</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.660" end="01:15:27.860" style="s2">and him he encountered all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.820" end="01:15:30.230" style="s2">terrible resistance which is completely</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.860" end="01:15:31.700" style="s2">unsurprising I mean first of all people</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.230" end="01:15:33.380" style="s2">in his family were annoyed that he would</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.700" end="01:15:35.330" style="s2">dare to try to take their dead mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.380" end="01:15:38.300" style="s2">place you know even though he was trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.330" end="01:15:39.920" style="s2">to do it for the best of reasons and we</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.300" end="01:15:41.810" style="s2">played with that for a couple of years</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.920" end="01:15:44.360" style="s2">and that was very interesting and then I</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.810" end="01:15:46.190" style="s2">realized that I was teaching students</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.360" end="01:15:49.190" style="s2">all these stories about purpose but</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.190" end="01:15:52.250" style="s2">nobody had ever had them write a story</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.190" end="01:15:55.640" style="s2">about their purpose essentially so I</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.250" end="01:15:57.260" style="s2">thought wasn&#39;t that interesting here are</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.640" end="01:15:59.300" style="s2">these these these kids they&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.260" end="01:16:02.930" style="s2">university they&#39;ve been in school for 15</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.300" end="01:16:06.770" style="s2">years and no one has ever sat them down</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.930" end="01:16:09.110" style="s2">and said well what sort of character do</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.770" end="01:16:11.240" style="s2">you want to develop who should you be</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.110" end="01:16:13.970" style="s2">and why don&#39;t you write that out and</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.240" end="01:16:15.530" style="s2">justify it you know six pages something</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.970" end="01:16:17.630" style="s2">like that with the same amount of care</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.530" end="01:16:19.790" style="s2">and attention that you might spend or</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.630" end="01:16:22.430" style="s2">even more on an essay about the war of</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.790" end="01:16:26.380" style="s2">1812 or something like that I think well</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.430" end="01:16:28.160" style="s2">well more I thought about that the more</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.380" end="01:16:29.690" style="s2">flabbergasted I would say I became</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.160" end="01:16:32.840" style="s2">because I thought well what that what</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.690" end="01:16:35.960" style="s2">how is it possible that we could set up</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.840" end="01:16:40.110" style="s2">a system and run people through it for</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.960" end="01:16:42.360" style="s2">15 years and never have them forced so</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.110" end="01:16:44.280" style="s2">speak to figure out who they wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.360" end="01:16:46.650" style="s2">be in to justify it in an articulate</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.280" end="01:16:48.540" style="s2">manner and so I built this program with</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.650" end="01:16:50.100" style="s2">my colleagues to help people do that and</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.540" end="01:16:51.840" style="s2">I used in my classes first and so I</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.100" end="01:16:54.600" style="s2">thought okay well here&#39;s the game and</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.840" end="01:16:56.190" style="s2">this is like rule to treat yourself like</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.600" end="01:16:58.560" style="s2">you&#39;re someone responsible for helping</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.190" end="01:17:00.449" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean be good to</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.560" end="01:17:02.670" style="s2">yourself it doesn&#39;t mean let me be nice</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.449" end="01:17:04.739" style="s2">to yourself it doesn&#39;t mean give</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.670" end="01:17:06.150" style="s2">yourself an easy life that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.739" end="01:17:08.130" style="s2">actually what you do to people if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.150" end="01:17:09.780" style="s2">care for them you actually present them</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.130" end="01:17:11.340" style="s2">with something like an optimal challenge</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.780" end="01:17:12.989" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do with kids if you love</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.340" end="01:17:14.400" style="s2">them as you present them with an optimal</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.989" end="01:17:15.810" style="s2">challenge so they can develop and grow</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.400" end="01:17:17.550" style="s2">so that&#39;s what you should do for</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.810" end="01:17:19.710" style="s2">yourself if you&#39;re taking care of</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.550" end="01:17:23.190" style="s2">yourself so I thought okay well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.710" end="01:17:24.929" style="s2">the game first of all assume that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.190" end="01:17:26.280" style="s2">worth taking a care that you&#39;re worth</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.929" end="01:17:27.929" style="s2">taking care of and that it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.280" end="01:17:29.790" style="s2">responsibility to do so even if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.929" end="01:17:31.110" style="s2">don&#39;t like yourself very much and lots</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.790" end="01:17:33.179" style="s2">of people don&#39;t and they have their</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.110" end="01:17:35.310" style="s2">reasons because everybody is very aware</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.179" end="01:17:37.230" style="s2">of their own flaws right unless your</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.310" end="01:17:39.630" style="s2">narcissistic you&#39;re more aware of your</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.230" end="01:17:40.830" style="s2">own flaws than of anyone else&#39;s flaws</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.630" end="01:17:42.119" style="s2">and maybe you&#39;re not very happy with</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.830" end="01:17:44.610" style="s2">yourself and you don&#39;t think that you</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.119" end="01:17:46.350" style="s2">deserve to have an okay life and so you</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.610" end="01:17:48.119" style="s2">punish yourself and you set yourself up</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.350" end="01:17:49.739" style="s2">for failure and all and all of that and</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.119" end="01:17:51.659" style="s2">that happens all the time or you just</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.739" end="01:17:54.630" style="s2">don&#39;t aim or you don&#39;t have any goals or</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.659" end="01:17:56.369" style="s2">you know you&#39;re guilty and resentful and</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.630" end="01:17:59.550" style="s2">feel that you should be punished so you</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.369" end="01:18:01.889" style="s2">have to abandon all that treat yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.550" end="01:18:04.550" style="s2">like you&#39;re someone you&#39;re responsible</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.889" end="01:18:06.630" style="s2">for helping responsible for helping</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.550" end="01:18:08.639" style="s2">imagine yourself three to five years</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.630" end="01:18:11.670" style="s2">into the future you get to have what you</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.639" end="01:18:13.889" style="s2">need if you&#39;re taking care of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.670" end="01:18:15.869" style="s2">you can have it but you have to figure</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.889" end="01:18:17.310" style="s2">out what it is because you are not going</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.869" end="01:18:20.760" style="s2">to get it unless you aim at it and</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.310" end="01:18:23.460" style="s2">that&#39;s rule ten is be precise in your</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.760" end="01:18:25.350" style="s2">speech and the reason I wrote that rule</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.460" end="01:18:26.400" style="s2">is is because you can be bloody sure</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.350" end="01:18:27.719" style="s2">that you&#39;re not going to hit a target</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.400" end="01:18:29.429" style="s2">unless you aim at it and the more</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.719" end="01:18:30.989" style="s2">precise you make the target the higher</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.429" end="01:18:33.860" style="s2">the probability that you&#39;ll aim at it</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.989" end="01:18:36.060" style="s2">that you&#39;ll hit it when you aim at it so</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.860" end="01:18:37.830" style="s2">what do you want you think well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.060" end="01:18:39.270" style="s2">want to even think about what I want</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.830" end="01:18:42.210" style="s2">because as soon as I figure out what I</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.270" end="01:18:44.489" style="s2">want then I&#39;ve made clear my conditions</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.210" end="01:18:46.679" style="s2">for failure and it&#39;s the last thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.489" end="01:18:48.929" style="s2">gonna do and so people enveloped</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.679" end="01:18:50.820" style="s2">themselves in vagueness so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.929" end="01:18:53.270" style="s2">have to confront their own failure but</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.820" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">then they fail and just don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.270" end="01:18:57.680" style="s2">except for maybe you know two decades</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.520" end="01:19:00.230" style="s2">later when it&#39;s too bloody late and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.680" end="01:19:02.030" style="s2">they&#39;re all catastrophic Lee hurt</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.230" end="01:19:04.520" style="s2">because they wasted their life it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.030" end="01:19:06.680" style="s2">very bad plan it&#39;s better just to figure</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.520" end="01:19:08.060" style="s2">out what you want and to tell yourself</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.680" end="01:19:09.890" style="s2">and then to tell your partner and to</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.060" end="01:19:11.930" style="s2">tell the people around you and maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.890" end="01:19:13.340" style="s2">can get it or maybe at least while</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.930" end="01:19:15.440" style="s2">you&#39;re struggling towards it you&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.340" end="01:19:18.170" style="s2">up with a better plan which is more</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.440" end="01:19:20.330" style="s2">likely the case what do you want from</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.170" end="01:19:22.520" style="s2">your family if you could have what you</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.330" end="01:19:25.370" style="s2">what was good for you what do you want</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.520" end="01:19:26.660" style="s2">from your intimate relationship how are</p>

<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:12.380" style="s2">that that&#39;s the case it&#39;s like actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.130" end="01:20:14.060" style="s2">it is the case if you don&#39;t specify what</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.380" end="01:20:16.640" style="s2">you want you won&#39;t get it and if you</p>

<p begin="01:20:16.640" end="01:20:20.750" style="s2">which means you&#39;re willing to make the</p>

<p begin="01:20:20.750" end="01:20:26.120" style="s2">probability that you&#39;ll get it expands</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.210" end="01:20:28.190" style="s2">immensely and miraculously in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.120" end="01:20:31.400" style="s2">now of course it assumes that what you</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.190" end="01:20:34.130" style="s2">want is within the bounds of appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.400" end="01:20:35.510" style="s2">reason let&#39;s say but you could also</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.130" end="01:20:38.270" style="s2">dream big and there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.510" end="01:20:40.940" style="s2">possibility that&#39;ll work out too so</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.270" end="01:20:43.370" style="s2">people ask answer those questions then</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.940" end="01:20:46.000" style="s2">they write for 15 minutes ok your life</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.370" end="01:20:49.790" style="s2">is the way you want it to be in 4 years</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.000" end="01:20:51.470" style="s2">what does it look like write as much as</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.790" end="01:20:52.700" style="s2">you can don&#39;t worry about being too</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.470" end="01:20:54.470" style="s2">accurate don&#39;t worry about grammar</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.700" end="01:20:55.550" style="s2">spelling don&#39;t worry about getting it</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.470" end="01:20:57.680" style="s2">right because you&#39;re not gonna get it</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.550" end="01:20:59.780" style="s2">right anyways just sketch the damn thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.680" end="01:21:01.460" style="s2">out if you have what you wanted what</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.780" end="01:21:03.470" style="s2">would it be and then we have them do the</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.460" end="01:21:05.150" style="s2">opposite which is all right take stock</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.470" end="01:21:07.100" style="s2">of yourself for a minute it&#39;s all your</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.150" end="01:21:10.190" style="s2">weaknesses and inadequacies and bit</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.100" end="01:21:12.350" style="s2">and resentments and sinful tendencies</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.190" end="01:21:17.060" style="s2">let&#39;s say now imagine that you let all</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.350" end="01:21:19.370" style="s2">of that go and occupy you just where</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.060" end="01:21:21.110" style="s2">which little corner of hell would you</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.370" end="01:21:23.570" style="s2">occupy in three to five years why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.110" end="01:21:26.120" style="s2">you write about that and everyone knows</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.570" end="01:21:29.200" style="s2">where they go if they let themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.120" end="01:21:31.460" style="s2">so then you have something to avoid and</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.200" end="01:21:35.180" style="s2">you have something to strive for</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.460" end="01:21:36.920" style="s2">and that makes you optimally motivated</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.180" end="01:21:38.390" style="s2">because maybe you&#39;re afraid you know you</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.920" end="01:21:40.370" style="s2">find out you don&#39;t like your job and</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.390" end="01:21:42.710" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid to change your job and</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.370" end="01:21:44.420" style="s2">then you think oh well if I don&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.710" end="01:21:46.610" style="s2">my job then I&#39;m heading for this little</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.420" end="01:21:48.620" style="s2">corner of hell that I outlined think</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.610" end="01:21:50.750" style="s2">well that&#39;s not a very good plan it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.620" end="01:21:52.340" style="s2">very threatening and stressful to change</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.750" end="01:21:54.200" style="s2">my job but it beats the hell out of</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.340" end="01:21:56.030" style="s2">ending up there and so then you have</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.200" end="01:21:57.560" style="s2">your anxieties behind you pushing you</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.030" end="01:21:59.960" style="s2">forward instead of in front of you</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.560" end="01:22:03.190" style="s2">stopping you cold and then we ask people</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.960" end="01:22:06.260" style="s2">to write a plan to implement their</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.190" end="01:22:09.230" style="s2">positive vision to justify it to come up</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.260" end="01:22:11.690" style="s2">with a strategy for for making it into a</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.230" end="01:22:14.210" style="s2">real world realization and we tested</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.690" end="01:22:17.390" style="s2">that on thousands of University students</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.210" end="01:22:18.920" style="s2">now and the upshot was that it decreased</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.390" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">the probability that they would drop out</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.920" end="01:22:25.370" style="s2">of university by 30% in fact in Canada</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:27.650" style="s2">we we did it for 90 minutes before kids</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.370" end="01:22:30.650" style="s2">went to college in the fall they came to</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.650" end="01:22:33.140" style="s2">their summer orientation neither rode</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.650" end="01:22:34.910" style="s2">for 90 minutes about something that</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.140" end="01:22:36.970" style="s2">required writing but that wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.910" end="01:22:39.440" style="s2">relevant or they wrote out of plan and</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.970" end="01:22:43.010" style="s2">it dropped the dropout rate among young</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.440" end="01:22:44.480" style="s2">men 50% in the first semester and it had</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.010" end="01:22:46.010" style="s2">the biggest effect on young men who</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.480" end="01:22:47.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t do that well in high school and</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.010" end="01:22:49.970" style="s2">who weren&#39;t oriented towards a</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.480" end="01:22:51.680" style="s2">professional career the consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.970" end="01:22:54.020" style="s2">that was that the University used it for</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.680" end="01:22:55.520" style="s2">one year and then stopped doing it so</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.020" end="01:22:58.190" style="s2">which was not surprising in the least</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.520" end="01:23:01.460" style="s2">but the reason that I&#39;m laying out this</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.190" end="01:23:04.060" style="s2">long story for you is because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.460" end="01:23:06.520" style="s2">what people need they need they need a</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.060" end="01:23:09.640" style="s2">differentiated and delineated purpose</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.520" end="01:23:12.290" style="s2">it&#39;s way more important than the money</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.640" end="01:23:13.760" style="s2">it isn&#39;t money that you need I know you</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.290" end="01:23:15.590" style="s2">need money for God&#39;s sake I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.760" end="01:23:18.440" style="s2">ignorant everybody needs money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.590" end="01:23:20.900" style="s2">not the point here it&#39;s the provision of</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.440" end="01:23:22.690" style="s2">money without purpose is not helpful</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.900" end="01:23:24.920" style="s2">and what people need is a purpose and</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.690" end="01:23:26.420" style="s2">they need that to develop that for</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.920" end="01:23:27.710" style="s2">themselves obviously because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.420" end="01:23:29.090" style="s2">something you have to participate in but</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.710" end="01:23:31.130" style="s2">it&#39;s something that society has to</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.090" end="01:23:32.960" style="s2">foster and the reason they need that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.130" end="01:23:35.510" style="s2">purpose is because that&#39;s what gives</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.960" end="01:23:38.300" style="s2">their life meaning think well think</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.510" end="01:23:39.860" style="s2">about this do you really think that you</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.300" end="01:23:43.429" style="s2">would be satisfied if you had money</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.860" end="01:23:45.469" style="s2">without responsibility so what okay god</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.429" end="01:23:47.690" style="s2">no responsibility because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.469" end="01:23:50.630" style="s2">everyone wants it&#39;s like I had a client</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.690" end="01:23:51.890" style="s2">he wanted to retire when he was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.630" end="01:23:53.239" style="s2">young and he and I said well what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.890" end="01:23:55.370" style="s2">retirement dream he said well I</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.239" end="01:23:57.170" style="s2">envisioned myself on a beach in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.370" end="01:24:02.929" style="s2">tropical island with a margarita in my</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.170" end="01:24:05.360" style="s2">hand and I thought what the hell is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.929" end="01:24:06.949" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay let&#39;s play that out let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.360" end="01:24:09.590" style="s2">be adult about this okay so you go down</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.949" end="01:24:12.679" style="s2">to your this like redheaded white guy</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.590" end="01:24:14.360" style="s2">you go down to the Caribbean and you sit</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.679" end="01:24:15.860" style="s2">on a beach and and you&#39;re sitting in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.360" end="01:24:17.300" style="s2">beach and you have like six margaritas</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.860" end="01:24:20.090" style="s2">and you&#39;re there for like three hours</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.300" end="01:24:21.560" style="s2">what happens the next day okay you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.090" end="01:24:23.239" style="s2">sunburned to a crisp</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.560" end="01:24:26.300" style="s2">right so you can&#39;t even go out of your</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.239" end="01:24:27.469" style="s2">hotel room and you&#39;re hungover okay and</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.300" end="01:24:29.150" style="s2">let&#39;s say now you hide in your hotel</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.469" end="01:24:31.250" style="s2">room for three or four days and you</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.150" end="01:24:33.770" style="s2">recover and then you repeat that every</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.250" end="01:24:35.929" style="s2">day for three months it&#39;s like you go</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.770" end="01:24:39.050" style="s2">outside and all the locals get away from</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.929" end="01:24:41.000" style="s2">you because you&#39;re the new drunk lecher</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.050" end="01:24:43.429" style="s2">who&#39;s come down from the north and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.000" end="01:24:45.380" style="s2">that&#39;s your vision for retirement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.429" end="01:24:47.090" style="s2">like okay so you have all the money you</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.380" end="01:24:48.920" style="s2">want no responsibility you don&#39;t have to</p>

<p begin="01:28:19.160" end="01:28:25.520" style="s2">than it might be you have to ask that</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.800" end="01:28:29.090" style="s2">you know with intent and generally</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.520" end="01:28:31.850" style="s2">speaking you&#39;ll get an answer almost</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.090" end="01:28:35.480" style="s2">immediately there&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.850" end="01:28:37.460" style="s2">could put right that day that would make</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.480" end="01:28:39.800" style="s2">things slightly better than they are and</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.460" end="01:28:41.870" style="s2">that&#39;s rule 4 which is compare yourself</p>

<p begin="01:28:41.870" end="01:28:47.090" style="s2">yesterday and not to who someone else is</p>

<p begin="01:28:53.120" end="01:28:56.750" style="s2">different really than thinking like if</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.980" end="01:28:58.970" style="s2">you think you have a problem you think</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.750" end="01:29:01.160" style="s2">you get an answer might not be the right</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.970" end="01:29:02.510" style="s2">answer but obviously you get an answer</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.160" end="01:29:04.040" style="s2">and you might think well I thought up</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.510" end="01:29:05.810" style="s2">that answer it&#39;s like well that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.040" end="01:29:07.340" style="s2">not much of an explanation because you</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.810" end="01:29:09.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know how you think it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:29:09.170" end="01:29:13.220" style="s2">head and that&#39;s how I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.700" end="01:29:15.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty shallow explanation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.220" end="01:29:16.850" style="s2">not much different than revelation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.500" end="01:29:18.530" style="s2">like you ask yourself the proper</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.850" end="01:29:20.990" style="s2">questions you&#39;ll get the proper answers</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.530" end="01:29:24.350" style="s2">but if you ask the right question and</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.990" end="01:29:26.660" style="s2">you want the answers right and those are</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.350" end="01:29:29.150" style="s2">not easy preconditions to set up because</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.660" end="01:29:34.250" style="s2">who knows you know if you&#39;re sitting on</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.150" end="01:29:36.290" style="s2">the edge of your bed thinking okay what</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.250" end="01:29:38.930" style="s2">am I doing wrong that&#39;s a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.290" end="01:29:40.700" style="s2">question to ask you know because if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.930" end="01:29:41.960" style="s2">really want to know you&#39;ll find out and</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.700" end="01:29:44.390" style="s2">then you&#39;ll find out that you really</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.960" end="01:29:46.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to know because generally</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.390" end="01:29:48.350" style="s2">speaking finding out what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.310" end="01:29:50.780" style="s2">wrong is not a pleasant experience and</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.350" end="01:29:54.080" style="s2">it means that you have to sacrifice part</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.780" end="01:29:58.460" style="s2">of yourself usually a burned-out stupid</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.080" end="01:30:00.500" style="s2">bitter corrupt arrogant nasty vengeful</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.460" end="01:30:06.800" style="s2">part of yourself but nonetheless part</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.500" end="01:30:08.540" style="s2">that you like and so so you can I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.800" end="01:30:10.670" style="s2">that room for those incremental</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.540" end="01:30:15.500" style="s2">improvements exists within everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.670" end="01:30:18.610" style="s2">grasp and and I think that it&#39;s a humble</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.500" end="01:30:21.050" style="s2">thing to do to ask how you could improve</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.610" end="01:30:23.030" style="s2">incrementally without interfering with</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.050" end="01:30:25.659" style="s2">anyone else like it&#39;s your problem not</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.030" end="01:30:28.880" style="s2">theirs but I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.659" end="01:30:31.130" style="s2">consequences of maintained incremental</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.880" end="01:30:34.820" style="s2">improvement are anything but incremental</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.130" end="01:30:37.400" style="s2">you get compound interest on incremental</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.820" end="01:30:38.869" style="s2">improvement no there&#39;s another rule in</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.400" end="01:30:41.329" style="s2">the New Testament called the Matthew</p>

<p begin="01:30:50.270" end="01:30:53.599" style="s2">you know that if you&#39;ve ever played</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.650" end="01:30:55.639" style="s2">Monopoly because that&#39;s what happens if</p>

<p begin="01:30:55.639" end="01:31:00.469" style="s2">reason for that that&#39;s a deep reason but</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.369" end="01:31:03.320" style="s2">what and it&#39;s a very harsh rule because</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.469" end="01:31:06.559" style="s2">it means as you start to wander off the</p>

<p begin="01:31:08.059" end="01:31:13.730" style="s2">increases nonlinearly and that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:31:35.989" end="01:31:42.889" style="s2">that you can engage upon if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.860" end="01:31:45.230" style="s2">reprobate is that each improvement</p>

<p begin="01:32:23.960" end="01:32:29.150" style="s2">games and they say well I could probably</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.050" end="01:32:30.619" style="s2">spend an hour a day without it</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.150" end="01:32:32.659" style="s2">interfering with the rest of my life</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.619" end="01:32:34.820" style="s2">which is kind of the issue right because</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.659" end="01:32:36.409" style="s2">if you play video games fine but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.820" end="01:32:38.000" style="s2">three hours means that you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.409" end="01:32:39.050" style="s2">your homework or something and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.000" end="01:32:40.850" style="s2">not a good game</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.050" end="01:32:42.920" style="s2">so he say okay well I want to play for</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.850" end="01:32:44.900" style="s2">an hour a day it&#39;s like okay well can</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.920" end="01:32:46.310" style="s2">you shift to an hour a day right now</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.900" end="01:32:48.770" style="s2">and this is supposed to be an honest</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.310" end="01:32:50.690" style="s2">conversation and the person says no I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.770" end="01:32:53.240" style="s2">tried that lots of times and every time</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.690" end="01:32:55.160" style="s2">I try I just fail and so you don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.240" end="01:32:57.890" style="s2">well quit failing go play what now or a</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.160" end="01:33:00.890" style="s2">day and the problem will be solved</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.890" end="01:33:03.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a stupid strategy you say okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.890" end="01:33:06.230" style="s2">well look you think about this and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.920" end="01:33:07.670" style="s2">agree to do this unless you think you</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.230" end="01:33:09.620" style="s2">will do it because otherwise it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.670" end="01:33:11.750" style="s2">waste of both of our times it&#39;s like do</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.620" end="01:33:13.460" style="s2">you think that you could track how much</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.750" end="01:33:16.390" style="s2">time you&#39;ve spent playing video games</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.460" end="01:33:21.080" style="s2">for one week don&#39;t change anything just</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.390" end="01:33:22.370" style="s2">track it and they think yeah I could</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.080" end="01:33:24.230" style="s2">probably do that but I might miss a</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.370" end="01:33:26.720" style="s2">couple of days and think okay fine so</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.230" end="01:33:28.310" style="s2">here&#39;s the deal five out of the next</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.720" end="01:33:29.900" style="s2">seven days you just track how much time</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.310" end="01:33:31.340" style="s2">you spend playing video games and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.900" end="01:33:33.020" style="s2">person says I think I can do that</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.340" end="01:33:35.030" style="s2">because that&#39;s what you want them to say</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.020" end="01:33:36.860" style="s2">you want them to succeed at the</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.030" end="01:33:38.360" style="s2">improvement there&#39;s not much of an</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.860" end="01:33:39.860" style="s2">improvement but it&#39;s something right</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.360" end="01:33:41.840" style="s2">then they come back and they say well</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.860" end="01:33:45.350" style="s2">yeah I was playing about four hours a</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.840" end="01:33:47.210" style="s2">day and so you say okay well fine good</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.350" end="01:33:49.010" style="s2">work man you got a track now we know</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.210" end="01:33:50.600" style="s2">what we know the parameters of your</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.010" end="01:33:52.280" style="s2">problem it&#39;s actually a little worse</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.600" end="01:33:55.850" style="s2">than you thought but at least you had</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.280" end="01:33:59.600" style="s2">enough sense to measure it we know where</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.850" end="01:34:01.760" style="s2">you&#39;re at okay do you think you could</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.600" end="01:34:06.920" style="s2">cut that down to three and a half hours</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.760" end="01:34:08.420" style="s2">every day and the person thinks no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.920" end="01:34:11.420" style="s2">pretty weak willed I don&#39;t think I could</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.420" end="01:34:14.480" style="s2">manage that you say well how about this</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.420" end="01:34:16.070" style="s2">do you think that two of the next seven</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.480" end="01:34:18.350" style="s2">days you can only play for three hours</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.070" end="01:34:19.790" style="s2">you think you can manage that and you</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.350" end="01:34:21.770" style="s2">don&#39;t you&#39;re not cynical about this</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.790" end="01:34:23.330" style="s2">you&#39;re not insulting the person any of</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.770" end="01:34:25.790" style="s2">that it&#39;s like because you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.330" end="01:34:27.830" style="s2">all you care is that they make some</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.790" end="01:34:30.080" style="s2">incremental movement towards their goal</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.830" end="01:34:31.610" style="s2">and the person thinks about that if they</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.080" end="01:34:33.830" style="s2">have any sense and they take their</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.610" end="01:34:36.320" style="s2">weakness into account and they think I</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.830" end="01:34:38.000" style="s2">think I could probably do that and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.320" end="01:34:42.650" style="s2">they come back the next week and they</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.000" end="01:34:44.780" style="s2">say I managed to spend three hours a day</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.650" end="01:34:46.610" style="s2">playing video games for three days and</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.780" end="01:34:52.670" style="s2">the rest were four hours and you say</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.610" end="01:34:54.780" style="s2">good work man you&#39;ve just got rid of 25%</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.670" end="01:34:57.540" style="s2">twelve and a half percent of your</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.780" end="01:35:01.110" style="s2">problem you&#39;re one-eighth of the way to</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.540" end="01:35:02.489" style="s2">fixing it in one week and you know the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.110" end="01:35:04.320" style="s2">person isn&#39;t gonna be all that thrilled</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.489" end="01:35:06.090" style="s2">with themselves because they don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.320" end="01:35:07.620" style="s2">the arithmetic they do and they don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.090" end="01:35:10.590" style="s2">the projection they think well I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.620" end="01:35:12.390" style="s2">pretty damn useless I&#39;m playing twenty</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.590" end="01:35:14.489" style="s2">five hours worth of video games a week</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.390" end="01:35:17.570" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing to pat myself on the back</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.489" end="01:35:21.120" style="s2">for it&#39;s like yes it is it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.570" end="01:35:23.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a market measurable improvement and</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.120" end="01:35:25.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a move in the right direction you</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.280" end="01:35:27.690" style="s2">know and then you say okay well on the</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.830" end="01:35:30.000" style="s2">day&#39;s you succeeded how did you manage</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.690" end="01:35:33.000" style="s2">to succeed and is there a way that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.000" end="01:35:35.400" style="s2">could do it for four days next week how</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.000" end="01:35:37.320" style="s2">about that or maybe you could even try</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.400" end="01:35:39.690" style="s2">five days you think you could do that</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.320" end="01:35:41.280" style="s2">and then you also tell the person look</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.690" end="01:35:42.980" style="s2">the other thing you got to understand is</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.280" end="01:35:46.530" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna improve like this</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.980" end="01:35:47.730" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna improve like this so some</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.530" end="01:35:49.920" style="s2">weeks you&#39;re gonna come back and say</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.730" end="01:35:51.360" style="s2">geez I back slid completely and I like</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.920" end="01:35:53.460" style="s2">played for four hours a day for seven</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.360" end="01:35:55.290" style="s2">days but doesn&#39;t matter because that</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.460" end="01:35:57.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you failed it just means</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.290" end="01:35:59.640" style="s2">that you slid back you want to calculate</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.780" end="01:36:02.040" style="s2">it over a month or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.640" end="01:36:03.540" style="s2">and you know generally speaking a month</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.040" end="01:36:06.870" style="s2">later the person&#39;s down to something</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.540" end="01:36:08.850" style="s2">like two hours a day and you&#39;ve figured</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.870" end="01:36:10.440" style="s2">out a ways of filling their time in with</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.850" end="01:36:13.050" style="s2">something productive otherwise and</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.440" end="01:36:15.300" style="s2">they&#39;re on their way and the general</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.050" end="01:36:17.940" style="s2">consequence of that is that every time</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.300" end="01:36:19.800" style="s2">they manage an accomplishment they get a</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.940" end="01:36:21.090" style="s2">little stronger in character take a</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.800" end="01:36:23.310" style="s2">little bit more confident than their</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.090" end="01:36:25.800" style="s2">ability to get a little bit less racked</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.310" end="01:36:27.840" style="s2">with self-disgust they get a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.800" end="01:36:29.610" style="s2">more hopeful about the future and they</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.840" end="01:36:32.100" style="s2">get more confident that they can make</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.610" end="01:36:33.270" style="s2">another change and if you&#39;re patient and</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.100" end="01:36:35.640" style="s2">you have to be patient with yourself</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.270" end="01:36:37.410" style="s2">that way it&#39;s like you reward those</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.640" end="01:36:39.060" style="s2">incremental improvements and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.410" end="01:36:41.489" style="s2">get all cynical about them and you think</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.060" end="01:36:43.170" style="s2">okay just imagine what would happen if</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.489" end="01:36:45.840" style="s2">you kept doing that every week for ten</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.170" end="01:36:47.700" style="s2">years and the answer to that is things</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.840" end="01:36:49.710" style="s2">would be so much better for you that you</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.700" end="01:36:51.360" style="s2">can&#39;t even imagine it with that much</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.710" end="01:36:54.930" style="s2">improvement or maybe even with half that</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.360" end="01:36:58.950" style="s2">much improvement and so that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.930" end="01:37:02.619" style="s2">a very good way of progressing so very</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.950" end="01:37:06.909" style="s2">good so</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.619" end="01:37:09.310" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a question here on the</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.909" end="01:37:11.980" style="s2">article written by your friend Bernard</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.310" end="01:37:18.489" style="s2">Schiff that&#39;s one of one of the many hit</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.980" end="01:37:20.710" style="s2">pieces so yeah from whether healthy I</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.489" end="01:37:23.290" style="s2">want to ask you what your thoughts are</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.710" end="01:37:25.389" style="s2">of the article written by Bernard Schiff</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.290" end="01:37:28.260" style="s2">kind of a white question but I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.389" end="01:37:31.929" style="s2">hear your side of the matter</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.260" end="01:37:35.790" style="s2">okay so Bernie Schiff is a friend of</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.929" end="01:37:38.230" style="s2">mine although he doesn&#39;t see it that way</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.790" end="01:37:40.360" style="s2">well I&#39;m not saying that to be funny</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.230" end="01:37:42.190" style="s2">like that&#39;s how I look at it and and</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.360" end="01:37:43.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a gloss to me because he was a good</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.190" end="01:37:46.000" style="s2">friend of mine I&#39;ve lost a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.960" end="01:37:50.020" style="s2">friends in the last two years and it&#39;s 2</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.000" end="01:37:52.119" style="s2">or 3 years and it&#39;s not pleasant but he</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.020" end="01:37:58.989" style="s2">had his reasons for doing what he did</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.119" end="01:38:03.790" style="s2">which I won&#39;t go into but there is one</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.989" end="01:38:05.650" style="s2">thing I will say about it he set forward</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.790" end="01:38:08.980" style="s2">a set of propositions about the way that</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.650" end="01:38:11.770" style="s2">I was interacting with my students and</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.980" end="01:38:15.880" style="s2">am interacting with all the people like</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.770" end="01:38:20.099" style="s2">you to whom I&#39;m lecturing and he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.880" end="01:38:24.969" style="s2">questions my motivations and fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.099" end="01:38:26.830" style="s2">but he said for example that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.969" end="01:38:29.800" style="s2">paraphrasing but this is the gist of it</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.830" end="01:38:32.469" style="s2">that my style was autocratic say in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.800" end="01:38:37.270" style="s2">classroom and he cited a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.469" end="01:38:41.849" style="s2">students who felt that way and I would</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.270" end="01:38:46.270" style="s2">say I&#39;ll say two things about that the</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.849" end="01:38:49.320" style="s2">the evaluations of my classes at Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.270" end="01:38:51.940" style="s2">and at the University of Toronto were</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.320" end="01:38:53.800" style="s2">almost invariably better than the</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.940" end="01:38:57.190" style="s2">evaluations of any classes they&#39;d ever</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.800" end="01:38:59.199" style="s2">had that&#39;s the first thing in my maps of</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.190" end="01:39:00.940" style="s2">meaning class the most common comment</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.199" end="01:39:02.290" style="s2">and that would have been from about 80%</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.940" end="01:39:03.900" style="s2">of students was that the class</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.290" end="01:39:05.469" style="s2">completely changed the way they</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.900" end="01:39:08.650" style="s2">conducted their lives</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.469" end="01:39:11.469" style="s2">so that&#39;s issue number one an issue</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.650" end="01:39:11.889" style="s2">number two is all those lectures are</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.469" end="01:39:14.230" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.889" end="01:39:16.239" style="s2">like not every lecture I&#39;ve given in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.230" end="01:39:17.499" style="s2">last 30 years is online but</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.239" end="01:39:20.440" style="s2">every lecture I&#39;ve given in the last</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.499" end="01:39:22.210" style="s2">four years is online plus one lecture</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.440" end="01:39:24.760" style="s2">series that I gave thirty years ago and</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.210" end="01:39:27.460" style="s2">a whole bunch of other talks and so if</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.760" end="01:39:29.260" style="s2">you want to see whether the accusations</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.460" end="01:39:32.139" style="s2">leveled at me and that argument in that</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.260" end="01:39:33.940" style="s2">article are true or you have to just go</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.139" end="01:39:36.280" style="s2">watch the lectures and if you think</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.940" end="01:39:37.749" style="s2">they&#39;re true well then he&#39;s right and if</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.280" end="01:39:38.949" style="s2">you don&#39;t think they&#39;re true then he</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.749" end="01:39:41.739" style="s2">isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.949" end="01:39:44.349" style="s2">the evidence is it&#39;s not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.739" end="01:39:47.380" style="s2">hidden I&#39;ve been recording my lectures</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.349" end="01:39:49.269" style="s2">since like while I recorded one in 1993</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.380" end="01:39:51.849" style="s2">at Harvard and so it&#39;s online and then</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.269" end="01:39:55.900" style="s2">there&#39;s like 200 hours of them so</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.849" end="01:39:57.730" style="s2">whatever my crimes they&#39;re there for</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.900" end="01:39:59.650" style="s2">everyone to see and to determine for</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.730" end="01:40:02.679" style="s2">themselves and so that&#39;s mostly what</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.650" end="01:40:05.380" style="s2">people are doing and that&#39;s fine with me</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.679" end="01:40:08.369" style="s2">so and that&#39;s pretty much all I have to</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.380" end="01:40:08.369" style="s2">say about that article</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.370" end="01:40:22.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a question from Makino&#39;s kart</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.990" end="01:40:25.070" style="s2">relating to what you discussed earlier</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.520" end="01:40:27.610" style="s2">and nuclear weapons what are your</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.070" end="01:40:30.560" style="s2">thoughts on mutually assured destruction</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.610" end="01:40:36.470" style="s2">will we be safer in a world without</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.560" end="01:40:39.530" style="s2">nuclear weapons I think it depends on</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.470" end="01:40:42.320" style="s2">how we decide to conduct ourselves you</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.530" end="01:40:43.670" style="s2">know it isn&#39;t obvious to me that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.320" end="01:40:45.880" style="s2">in a position where we can trust</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.670" end="01:40:49.880" style="s2">ourselves without nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.880" end="01:40:52.820" style="s2">you know nuclear weapons are like</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.880" end="01:40:55.910" style="s2">they&#39;re like a judgmental God in some</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.820" end="01:40:58.640" style="s2">sense if you misbehave too badly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.910" end="01:41:00.620" style="s2">gonna be hell to pay and so the</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.640" end="01:41:01.820" style="s2">consequence of that since the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.620" end="01:41:05.150" style="s2">Second World War</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.820" end="01:41:10.880" style="s2">thank God is that no one has misbehaved</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.150" end="01:41:13.790" style="s2">too badly yet and so I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.880" end="01:41:15.730" style="s2">that&#39;s we&#39;ve had comparative peace since</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.790" end="01:41:18.490" style="s2">the end of the Second World War</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.730" end="01:41:21.680" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t mean there hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.490" end="01:41:23.600" style="s2">chronic low-level conflict and some of</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.680" end="01:41:25.160" style="s2">it I&#39;m not saying that the conflicts</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.600" end="01:41:27.890" style="s2">have been trivial but compared to world</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.160" end="01:41:29.660" style="s2">war two they are trivial and certainly</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.890" end="01:41:33.140" style="s2">compared to World War three they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.660" end="01:41:35.240" style="s2">trivial and so I would say that the</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.140" end="01:41:37.190" style="s2">hydrogen bomb has put the fear of God</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.240" end="01:41:39.290" style="s2">into us and that there&#39;s some utility in</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.190" end="01:41:41.660" style="s2">that obviously it would be better if we</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.290" end="01:41:43.340" style="s2">didn&#39;t need that because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.660" end="01:41:45.380" style="s2">dangerous and the probability that</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.340" end="01:41:47.690" style="s2">there&#39;ll be an accident at some point</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.380" end="01:41:50.330" style="s2">seems to me to be a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.690" end="01:41:56.870" style="s2">because there&#39;s always an accident right</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.330" end="01:41:59.840" style="s2">and so we&#39;re playing with fire but but</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.870" end="01:42:04.130" style="s2">it isn&#39;t self-evident to me that so far</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.840" end="01:42:06.680" style="s2">it&#39;s being a bad thing even the even the</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.130" end="01:42:08.480" style="s2">Soviets even Stalin although he was</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.680" end="01:42:10.940" style="s2">probably there&#39;s some evidence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.480" end="01:42:12.800" style="s2">telling stellen was gearing up for the</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.940" end="01:42:14.510" style="s2">third world war and that he would have</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.800" end="01:42:17.060" style="s2">been willing to put Europe to the</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.510" end="01:42:18.050" style="s2">thermonuclear torch and he was just the</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.060" end="01:42:20.060" style="s2">kind of guy to do it</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.050" end="01:42:22.700" style="s2">he&#39;d been practicing doing that for a</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.060" end="01:42:25.340" style="s2">long time after you kill your ten</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.700" end="01:42:27.230" style="s2">millionth person the next 10 million</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.340" end="01:42:29.840" style="s2">come pretty easy and</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.230" end="01:42:31.400" style="s2">so he was there is evidence that he was</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.840" end="01:42:34.900" style="s2">gearing up for that in Western Europe</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.400" end="01:42:38.750" style="s2">and that he was probably killed and so</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.900" end="01:42:41.660" style="s2">but apart from Stalin no one has come</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.750" end="01:42:45.020" style="s2">along who&#39;s been corrupt and malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.660" end="01:42:50.450" style="s2">enough to make that a priority and so</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.020" end="01:42:52.730" style="s2">that&#39;s so far a testament to the</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.450" end="01:42:55.790" style="s2">fundamental goodness of the human heart</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.730" end="01:43:03.410" style="s2">but what do you think Hitler would have</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.790" end="01:43:04.820" style="s2">done with nuclear weapons I think he</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.410" end="01:43:08.239" style="s2">probably would have cleared out most of</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.820" end="01:43:11.150" style="s2">you Eastern Europe being part of his</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.239" end="01:43:13.370" style="s2">plan I mean you perhaps know this but</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.150" end="01:43:16.340" style="s2">Hitler believed the Germans deserved an</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.370" end="01:43:18.590" style="s2">empire like many other East many other</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.340" end="01:43:21.110" style="s2">European countries had an empire and he</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.590" end="01:43:22.820" style="s2">felt that it was no different for the</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.110" end="01:43:25.820" style="s2">Germans to pursue their empire than it</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.820" end="01:43:27.350" style="s2">was for the British and that his empire</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.820" end="01:43:29.300" style="s2">was gonna be in Eastern Europe because</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.350" end="01:43:32.090" style="s2">what the hell good are they anyways that</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.300" end="01:43:33.620" style="s2">was his attitude and I think he would</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.090" end="01:43:35.480" style="s2">have used whatever means necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.620" end="01:43:37.010" style="s2">clear out as much territory as possible</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.480" end="01:43:40.040" style="s2">so that it could have been inhabited by</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.010" end="01:43:42.110" style="s2">his his VOC that&#39;s what it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.040" end="01:43:44.000" style="s2">now you know you might ask well could</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.110" end="01:43:48.980" style="s2">have that been done by nuclear means and</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.000" end="01:43:51.500" style="s2">the answer that&#39;s probably so I think he</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.980" end="01:43:53.239" style="s2">would have put them to use I mean my</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.500" end="01:43:54.860" style="s2">sense of Hitler you say well what</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.239" end="01:43:56.870" style="s2">motivated Hitler you say well he wanted</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.860" end="01:43:59.480" style="s2">to rule the world it&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.870" end="01:44:01.730" style="s2">think that&#39;s what he wanted I think he</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.480" end="01:44:02.900" style="s2">got exactly what he wanted he wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.730" end="01:44:04.610" style="s2">put a bullet through his head when</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.900" end="01:44:07.880" style="s2">Berlin was in ruins and Europe was in</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.610" end="01:44:10.940" style="s2">flames and that&#39;s exactly what he did</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.880" end="01:44:15.050" style="s2">and you think well no one could aim for</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.940" end="01:44:19.489" style="s2">that it&#39;s like think again someone aimed</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.050" end="01:44:25.340" style="s2">for it and they got it too so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.489" end="01:44:28.989" style="s2">think he would have stopped so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.340" end="01:44:36.050" style="s2">question here regarding the</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.989" end="01:44:42.590" style="s2">controversial statement Rick regarding</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.050" end="01:44:45.680" style="s2">enforced monogamy so from leastly</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.590" end="01:44:49.670" style="s2">request one stating the obvious often</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.680" end="01:44:52.219" style="s2">suggests an agenda I agree with your</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.670" end="01:44:55.460" style="s2">observation that lack of sex for young</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.219" end="01:44:58.310" style="s2">man can make societies more violent what</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.460" end="01:45:03.650" style="s2">should be done that&#39;s actually not my</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.310" end="01:45:07.520" style="s2">observation so that isn&#39;t my observation</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.650" end="01:45:10.160" style="s2">I mean words matter my observation is</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.520" end="01:45:13.550" style="s2">that social norms favoring monogamy are</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.160" end="01:45:15.770" style="s2">essentially a human universal and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.550" end="01:45:19.460" style="s2">reason for that is that we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.770" end="01:45:22.520" style="s2">through painful experience that social</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.460" end="01:45:27.800" style="s2">conventions favouring monogamy are the</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.520" end="01:45:30.680" style="s2">best way to reduce male violence provide</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.800" end="01:45:33.650" style="s2">a secure environment for children and</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.680" end="01:45:35.450" style="s2">help women find partners to help them</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.650" end="01:45:37.719" style="s2">with the difficult process of</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.450" end="01:45:41.770" style="s2">reproduction and child rearing and</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.719" end="01:45:47.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the woman who wrote that article</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.770" end="01:45:48.920" style="s2">knew perfectly well that when I used the</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.060" end="01:45:50.989" style="s2">term enforced monogamy and we only</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.920" end="01:45:54.130" style="s2">discussed this for probably two minutes</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.989" end="01:45:56.890" style="s2">out of an interview that lasted two days</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.130" end="01:46:01.880" style="s2">she knew perfectly well that I meant</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.890" end="01:46:05.750" style="s2">social convention but it was in her</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.880" end="01:46:08.989" style="s2">interest to find a phrase that could be</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.750" end="01:46:11.590" style="s2">misinterpreted so that what I was</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.989" end="01:46:16.150" style="s2">speaking about could be misinterpreted</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.590" end="01:46:19.400" style="s2">so here&#39;s what enforced monogamy means</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.150" end="01:46:23.570" style="s2">so let&#39;s say my son is planning to get</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.400" end="01:46:25.430" style="s2">married in the fall and I am happy about</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.570" end="01:46:27.590" style="s2">his fiancee we seem to get along quite</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.430" end="01:46:31.610" style="s2">well they seem to do quite well together</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.590" end="01:46:35.330" style="s2">and so I&#39;m pleased that they&#39;ve made the</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.610" end="01:46:36.800" style="s2">decision to start their life together so</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.330" end="01:46:41.119" style="s2">now imagine</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.800" end="01:46:45.179" style="s2">that he comes to me any year and he says</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.119" end="01:46:46.409" style="s2">I&#39;ve got some news for you dad I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.179" end="01:46:48.570" style="s2">married for a whole year and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.409" end="01:46:51.630" style="s2">managed to have three Affairs during</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.570" end="01:46:52.829" style="s2">that time and not get caught and what am</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.630" end="01:46:54.719" style="s2">I supposed to do about that</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.829" end="01:46:55.979" style="s2">hey I&#39;m put my arm around him and say</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.719" end="01:47:01.079" style="s2">good work kid</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.979" end="01:47:03.169" style="s2">way to be it&#39;s like no first of all if</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.079" end="01:47:06.239" style="s2">he did that he wouldn&#39;t tell me and</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.169" end="01:47:09.899" style="s2">second if he did tell me which I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.239" end="01:47:12.389" style="s2">imagine I would ask him just what the</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.899" end="01:47:14.459" style="s2">hell did he think he was doing that that</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.389" end="01:47:17.369" style="s2">was no way to conduct himself and it</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.459" end="01:47:20.130" style="s2">would be something I would regard as</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.369" end="01:47:21.899" style="s2">contemptible not only the affairs but</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.130" end="01:47:23.550" style="s2">the deceit that goes along with it and</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.899" end="01:47:25.769" style="s2">the violation of his vows and the</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.550" end="01:47:27.929" style="s2">breaking of the harmonious relationship</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.769" end="01:47:29.610" style="s2">that he decided voluntarily to establish</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.929" end="01:47:31.559" style="s2">and the weakening of the family</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.610" end="01:47:34.019" style="s2">structure and the trouble that he put</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.559" end="01:47:36.260" style="s2">everyone through to attend the marriage</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.019" end="01:47:39.389" style="s2">ceremony in good faith and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.260" end="01:47:43.979" style="s2">well it&#39;s that&#39;s enforced monogamy for</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.389" end="01:47:46.260" style="s2">God&#39;s sake it&#39;s the it&#39;s the assumption</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.979" end="01:47:49.530" style="s2">of the responsibility on the part of</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.260" end="01:47:52.110" style="s2">people who enter a relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.530" end="01:47:53.789" style="s2">some expectation of permanence to uphold</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.110" end="01:47:56.880" style="s2">the promise that they make when they do</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.789" end="01:48:02.459" style="s2">that and she knew that bloody perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.880" end="01:48:04.769" style="s2">well and so it&#39;s just a it&#39;s so idiotic</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.459" end="01:48:07.320" style="s2">it&#39;s almost impossible to believe you</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.769" end="01:48:09.840" style="s2">know first of all if you&#39;re gonna accuse</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.320" end="01:48:11.429" style="s2">someone of something you should at least</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.840" end="01:48:14.849" style="s2">accuse them of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.429" end="01:48:16.559" style="s2">plausible it&#39;s like what there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.849" end="01:48:18.749" style="s2">anybody who goes around thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.559" end="01:48:21.269" style="s2">monogamy should be enforced at the point</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.749" end="01:48:23.880" style="s2">of a gun you know maybe the odd Isis</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.269" end="01:48:26.179" style="s2">wingnut does that thinks that but no</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.880" end="01:48:29.309" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anyone who thinks that</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.179" end="01:48:32.399" style="s2">excluding me and she knew that perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.309" end="01:48:34.619" style="s2">well and so if that&#39;s the best that my</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.399" end="01:48:36.599" style="s2">those who regard themselves as my</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.619" end="01:48:40.139" style="s2">enemies on the left can manage as a</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.599" end="01:48:42.869" style="s2">character slur then well you know have a</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.139" end="01:48:46.519" style="s2">derp boys and girls it&#39;s pretty bloody</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.869" end="01:48:46.519" style="s2">pathetic as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.219" end="01:48:55.160" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you one more thing about that</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.600" end="01:48:57.080" style="s2">here&#39;s something interesting I detailed</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.160" end="01:48:58.940" style="s2">this out in 12 rules for life I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.080" end="01:49:01.160" style="s2">have the figures exactly right because I</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.940" end="01:49:04.580" style="s2">haven&#39;t got to memorize but you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.160" end="01:49:07.010" style="s2">over the last 20 years the desire for</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.580" end="01:49:08.810" style="s2">marriage has increased among young women</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.010" end="01:49:11.449" style="s2">and by a substantial margin I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.810" end="01:49:14.150" style="s2">35% something like that at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.449" end="01:49:17.179" style="s2">it&#39;s decreased among men by about 17</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.150" end="01:49:21.920" style="s2">percent it&#39;s like so why am I telling</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.179" end="01:49:24.230" style="s2">you that it&#39;s like well are we so blind</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.920" end="01:49:28.600" style="s2">that we don&#39;t realize what most people</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.230" end="01:49:32.449" style="s2">want like most people who aren&#39;t cynical</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.600" end="01:49:34.640" style="s2">dream that they&#39;ll find a monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.449" end="01:49:36.110" style="s2">partner and you think well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.640" end="01:49:37.520" style="s2">evidence for that well first of all</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.110" end="01:49:39.380" style="s2">there&#39;s evidence for that because all</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.520" end="01:49:41.510" style="s2">you have to do is ask people and the</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.380" end="01:49:43.160" style="s2">majority of them tell you that but</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.510" end="01:49:45.620" style="s2">there&#39;s way more evidence than that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.160" end="01:49:48.860" style="s2">like what do you do you you take your</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.620" end="01:49:51.500" style="s2">date to a romantic comedy and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.860" end="01:49:54.199" style="s2">structure of the romantic comedy man</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.500" end="01:49:55.910" style="s2">lies to partner and has multiple affairs</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.199" end="01:49:58.790" style="s2">and you go away from that romantic</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.910" end="01:50:01.130" style="s2">comedy and you think that was fun let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.790" end="01:50:02.780" style="s2">do that it&#39;s like that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.130" end="01:50:05.690" style="s2">happens is you you go to a romantic</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.780" end="01:50:08.290" style="s2">comedy together and you see a couple who</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.690" end="01:50:11.000" style="s2">are attracted and repulsed across the</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.290" end="01:50:12.890" style="s2">across the dynamics of the movie and</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.000" end="01:50:14.360" style="s2">they overcome a bunch of obstacles and</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.890" end="01:50:17.630" style="s2">they decide to live happily ever after</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.360" end="01:50:20.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s the romantic comedy and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.630" end="01:50:22.280" style="s2">like a surefire success if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.120" end="01:50:23.929" style="s2">reasonably handled because it reflects</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.280" end="01:50:26.390" style="s2">what people want and the reason it</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.929" end="01:50:29.540" style="s2">reflects that is because basically</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.390" end="01:50:31.699" style="s2">although not without exception human</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.540" end="01:50:33.860" style="s2">beings are monogamous we tilt towards</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.699" end="01:50:35.989" style="s2">monogamy that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.860" end="01:50:37.520" style="s2">serial in monogamous and it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.989" end="01:50:40.940" style="s2">that there aren&#39;t people who tend</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.520" end="01:50:43.850" style="s2">towards multiple partners but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.940" end="01:50:45.800" style="s2">the dream that&#39;s for sure it&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.850" end="01:50:48.800" style="s2">we enforce the social norms it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.800" end="01:50:51.440" style="s2">universal human standard it&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.800" end="01:50:53.719" style="s2">makes for good people individuals or</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.440" end="01:50:56.810" style="s2">good intimate relationships or solid</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.719" end="01:50:59.630" style="s2">families or stable communities and so</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.810" end="01:51:00.409" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how that can be</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.630" end="01:51:02.929" style="s2">contentious</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.409" end="01:51:08.679" style="s2">how did that become contentious what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.929" end="01:51:12.409" style="s2">the alternative like responsibility less</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.679" end="01:51:16.039" style="s2">impulsive sex it&#39;s like do it man</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.409" end="01:51:19.159" style="s2">do it for 15 years see how much fun it</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.039" end="01:51:21.889" style="s2">is see where you end up you&#39;ll certainly</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.159" end="01:51:23.840" style="s2">end up cynical you&#39;ll definitely end up</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.889" end="01:51:25.429" style="s2">alone well then what the hell are you</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.840" end="01:51:28.189" style="s2">gonna do what are you gonna do when</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.429" end="01:51:29.630" style="s2">you&#39;re 45 and you don&#39;t have anyone know</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.189" end="01:51:31.249" style="s2">what are you gonna do for the next 35</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.630" end="01:51:32.900" style="s2">years you don&#39;t have kids you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.249" end="01:51:34.550" style="s2">gonna have grandchildren you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.900" end="01:51:36.439" style="s2">someone to tangle your story together</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.550" end="01:51:38.449" style="s2">with you don&#39;t have anything that lends</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.439" end="01:51:41.380" style="s2">solidity to your life you&#39;ve got no</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.449" end="01:51:44.059" style="s2">responsibility and so no self-respect oh</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.380" end="01:51:45.619" style="s2">if that&#39;s what you want that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.059" end="01:51:47.959" style="s2">you&#39;re promoting as an alternative to</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.619" end="01:51:51.380" style="s2">enforced monogamy it&#39;s like have a derp</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.959" end="01:52:04.699" style="s2">it&#39;s your life you&#39;ll see that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.380" end="01:52:06.949" style="s2">sense of it so now here&#39;s a good one</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.699" end="01:52:13.010" style="s2">what can Marxism contribute to our</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.949" end="01:52:15.169" style="s2">modern-day world by Arnie it can</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.010" end="01:52:16.510" style="s2">contribute Venezuela and if you have and</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.169" end="01:52:20.560" style="s2">it has</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.510" end="01:52:20.560" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.000" end="01:52:27.660" style="s2">so it&#39;ll be a little bit less cynical</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.840" end="01:52:29.100" style="s2">but we&#39;ve seen what it can contribute I</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.660" end="01:52:31.199" style="s2">don&#39;t know how many bloody times we have</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.100" end="01:52:33.120" style="s2">to run the experiment you know that</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.199" end="01:52:33.660" style="s2">wasn&#39;t real Marxism I know what that</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.120" end="01:52:35.850" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.660" end="01:52:40.620" style="s2">I know what that sentence means what</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.850" end="01:52:43.620" style="s2">that means is if I was the dictator with</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.620" end="01:52:46.380" style="s2">my profound understanding of Marx&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.620" end="01:52:49.370" style="s2">intent and my universal benevolent</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.380" end="01:52:52.560" style="s2">compassion uncontaminated by any</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.370" end="01:52:55.770" style="s2">proclivity towards darkness or sin I</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.560" end="01:52:57.560" style="s2">would bring on the socialist utopia</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.770" end="01:53:00.690" style="s2">that&#39;s what it means</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.560" end="01:53:02.340" style="s2">fundamentally and if someone says that</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.690" end="01:53:03.930" style="s2">and claims it then you should get the</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.340" end="01:53:05.660" style="s2">hell away from them as fast as you</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.930" end="01:53:08.670" style="s2">possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.660" end="01:53:10.380" style="s2">okay so Marx was concerned about</p>

<p begin="01:55:14.639" end="01:55:19.949" style="s2">I think Marxism has already contributed</p>

<p begin="01:55:26.099" end="01:55:32.550" style="s2">because it has its appeal and its appeal</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.760" end="01:55:35.880" style="s2">comes from grains of truth that it uses</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.550" end="01:55:38.429" style="s2">and tries to stretch across and explain</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.880" end="01:55:41.270" style="s2">well we are the Marxists point to the</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.429" end="01:55:44.670" style="s2">pernicious problem of inequality and</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.270" end="01:55:46.800" style="s2">inequality is a problem it&#39;s inequality</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.670" end="01:55:48.719" style="s2">is a problem I mean I outlined that in</p>

<p begin="01:55:48.719" end="01:55:52.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a left-wing and the reason there</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.670" end="01:55:54.210" style="s2">should be a left-wing is because</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.020" end="01:55:56.420" style="s2">inequality is a problem it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.210" end="01:55:59.099" style="s2">addressed and when you set up a</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.420" end="01:56:00.420" style="s2">hierarchical structure which you need to</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.099" end="01:56:03.900" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to pursue things of</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.420" end="01:56:07.619" style="s2">value then the hierarchy tends to ossify</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.900" end="01:56:09.179" style="s2">and and and and become rigid and it</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.619" end="01:56:10.469" style="s2">becomes hard for people at the bottom to</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.179" end="01:56:11.790" style="s2">climb to the top and so they get</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.469" end="01:56:14.070" style="s2">dispossessed and that can become</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.790" end="01:56:16.530" style="s2">permanent that&#39;s a bad thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.070" end="01:56:18.900" style="s2">everyone&#39;s problem left-wing centrist</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.530" end="01:56:21.900" style="s2">right-wing doesn&#39;t matter inequality is</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.900" end="01:56:23.489" style="s2">a problem but that doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.900" end="01:56:25.949" style="s2">can lay it at the feet of the</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.489" end="01:56:28.139" style="s2">institutions of the West and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.949" end="01:56:29.909" style="s2">where Marxism goes wrong and it also</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.139" end="01:56:32.639" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that we know how to fix</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.909" end="01:56:36.090" style="s2">inequality it&#39;s really a hard problem</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.639" end="01:56:38.969" style="s2">and so it it&#39;s a much harder problem</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.090" end="01:56:40.560" style="s2">than people think now when we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.969" end="01:56:42.719" style="s2">what to do about it we&#39;ve done some</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.560" end="01:56:44.699" style="s2">things and you know our culture is very</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.719" end="01:56:45.869" style="s2">the Scandinavian countries tend to be a</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.699" end="01:56:47.849" style="s2">little bit more on the income</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.869" end="01:56:48.780" style="s2">redistribution side and that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.849" end="01:56:50.429" style="s2">have worked</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.780" end="01:56:51.780" style="s2">reasonably well I mean the Scandinavian</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.429" end="01:56:53.550" style="s2">countries are pretty damn livable</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.780" end="01:56:56.489" style="s2">they&#39;ve got their problems particularly</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.550" end="01:56:58.079" style="s2">Sweden as far as I can tell but but but</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.489" end="01:57:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s easier for homogeneous small</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.079" end="01:57:02.460" style="s2">countries to do redistribution by all</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.480" end="01:57:03.989" style="s2">appearances it&#39;s not so easy for a place</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.460" end="01:57:05.760" style="s2">like the United States which is much</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.989" end="01:57:08.429" style="s2">bigger and much more diverse and has a</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.760" end="01:57:10.710" style="s2">much broader range of problems and so</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.429" end="01:57:13.289" style="s2">the Western countries are stumbling</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.710" end="01:57:15.869" style="s2">through some of them have steeper</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.289" end="01:57:18.150" style="s2">hierarchies and less of a social safety</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.869" end="01:57:19.920" style="s2">net like the US although it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.150" end="01:57:22.860" style="s2">productive intent is to have very low</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.920" end="01:57:24.900" style="s2">levels of employment and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.860" end="01:57:26.639" style="s2">places like the Scandinavian countries</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.900" end="01:57:29.099" style="s2">where the social and Canada where the</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.639" end="01:57:32.730" style="s2">social safety net is more well developed</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.099" end="01:57:34.500" style="s2">but that struggle with with with with</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.730" end="01:57:36.090" style="s2">improving productivity and with higher</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.500" end="01:57:38.070" style="s2">rates of unemployment most of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.090" end="01:57:39.570" style="s2">countries so we don&#39;t know how to get</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.070" end="01:57:41.369" style="s2">that right but we&#39;re kind of muddling</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.570" end="01:57:43.530" style="s2">through it and at the same time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.369" end="01:57:45.989" style="s2">muddling through it almost all of us are</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.530" end="01:57:48.510" style="s2">getting absolutely richer and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.989" end="01:57:49.920" style="s2">a pretty good default position to be in</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.510" end="01:57:52.440" style="s2">when you&#39;re trying to sort out the</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.920" end="01:57:54.090" style="s2">inequality problem and you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.440" end="01:57:57.840" style="s2">been thinking over the last weeks that</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.090" end="01:58:00.960" style="s2">there are you know you can express these</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.840" end="01:58:02.400" style="s2">problems in quasi mathematical form it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.960" end="01:58:04.739" style="s2">like there&#39;s probably a rule that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.400" end="01:58:06.929" style="s2">something like in order to produce one</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.739" end="01:58:09.840" style="s2">increment of absolute wealth you have to</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.929" end="01:58:11.550" style="s2">allow three increments of inequality or</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.840" end="01:58:12.929" style="s2">something like that inequality is the</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.550" end="01:58:15.630" style="s2">price you pay for the generation of</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.929" end="01:58:18.030" style="s2">wealth and I suspect because the right</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.630" end="01:58:21.000" style="s2">amount of inequality the right amount of</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.030" end="01:58:22.829" style="s2">inequality is not zero it&#39;s some number</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.000" end="01:58:25.920" style="s2">and you could debate about what that</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.829" end="01:58:28.679" style="s2">number is but it&#39;s not zero you flatten</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.920" end="01:58:31.770" style="s2">everyone out you get nothing if you have</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.679" end="01:58:34.050" style="s2">a meritocracy of some sort than if</p>
