<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.310" style="s2">welcome Jay cousins to project raising</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.610" end="00:00:11.309" style="s2">and he&#39;ll be talking about his project</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">all of being home and get away Jay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.309" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">thanks very much the opportunity Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">so the I&#39;m presently the the default</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">patterns by which we live almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">everything that we do is environmentally</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:35.489" style="s2">and socially destructive almost by</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">default and this is obviously hugely</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.489" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">problematic when we scale this across</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">the number of billions of us that there</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:46.710" style="s2">are on the planet so to take a case in</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">point like I mean I mean a house in</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.710" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">dahab at the moment and during the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">during the summer time because the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">buildings built of concrete it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">huge amount of energy to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:00:59.370" style="s2">building cool because I need to use</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">air-conditioning in order to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">thermal comfort now it&#39;s wintertime I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">have the polar opposite of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:08.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an enormously costly to heat and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">can&#39;t maintain thermal comfort again</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:12.650" style="s2">because of the way that the building is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">designed but we can essentially</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.650" end="00:01:19.229" style="s2">extrapolate this across almost every</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">aspect of our lives and down to our</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.229" end="00:01:25.430" style="s2">diets if we are eating bread for example</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">there cornfields from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.430" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">butterflies birds and numerous insects</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">is essentially a uncrossable as it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:40.820" style="s2">we&#39;re destroying habitats pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:46.829" style="s2">we so the attempt is really to look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.820" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">in order that homes and houses habitat</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.829" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">generating rather than habitat</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">destroying and and how we actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">create systems for ourselves that we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">live in in a comfortable way but our</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">very existence is contributing to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:07.740" style="s2">creation of habitat to the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">food and to build a better environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.740" end="00:02:12.960" style="s2">for ourselves and also society and other</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:14.970" style="s2">beings on the planet that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.960" end="00:02:17.880" style="s2">a planet with that provide us with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.970" end="00:02:21.300" style="s2">essential services that we need how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.880" end="00:02:24.650" style="s2">approaching that and and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.300" end="00:02:27.960" style="s2">approach that is to explore how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.650" end="00:02:29.730" style="s2">presently take our wastes because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:32.340" style="s2">been coming at it from a position of not</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.730" end="00:02:35.820" style="s2">having a lot of resource and not having</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.340" end="00:02:38.490" style="s2">a lot of access to money and funds which</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.820" end="00:02:42.690" style="s2">I found myself over the last year or so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.490" end="00:02:44.880" style="s2">so I began experimenting with trash that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">I found on the streets of dahab so</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.880" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of plastic waste here</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:52.290" style="s2">which is a huge problem and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">a lot of palm fronds and palm wastes</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.290" end="00:03:00.060" style="s2">that can be found in the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:03:03.210" style="s2">I started to take that and transform it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">to create structures to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.210" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">things like furniture tables chairs and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:12.660" style="s2">things like that and that allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">provide for my immediate needs but now</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.660" end="00:03:16.770" style="s2">I&#39;m exploring it on a larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">making things like and this is in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.770" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">early stages but start to make dome and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:24.140" style="s2">yes and tents and I hope to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:26.790" style="s2">stronger more durable structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.140" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">ultimately that can grow habitat on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.790" end="00:03:36.630" style="s2">outside and can provide the vault</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">dweller on-site the core of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.630" end="00:03:43.110" style="s2">doing and and what I&#39;m developing but</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:46.020" style="s2">I&#39;m also exploring it from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.110" end="00:03:48.410" style="s2">perspective of it these challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.020" end="00:03:53.880" style="s2">these problems they can&#39;t be solved on</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.410" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">like by by one set of mind and and hands</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.880" end="00:03:57.630" style="s2">and heart working on it</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">I need many other people also</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.630" end="00:04:03.450" style="s2">considering these challenges considering</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:05.580" style="s2">how you can actually build and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.450" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">create an alternative existence for</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.580" end="00:04:13.400" style="s2">ourselves so this has been more of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">kind of long-term quest over the last</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.400" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">few years there&#39;s been this question how</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:23.480" style="s2">do we move from a culture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:25.220" style="s2">predominantly oriented around</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.480" end="00:04:28.010" style="s2">when we make anything it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.220" end="00:04:31.250" style="s2">digital sphere and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.010" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">computers in a way of our production and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.250" end="00:04:34.700" style="s2">our thinking about things and how we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:37.700" style="s2">produce things and how do we get more</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.700" end="00:04:39.410" style="s2">people engaging with the world with</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.700" end="00:04:41.540" style="s2">their hands with reality with their</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.410" end="00:04:44.030" style="s2">hands in order that they can better</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.540" end="00:04:47.810" style="s2">understand how to engage with reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.030" end="00:04:50.180" style="s2">and how to make things so on that scale</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.810" end="00:04:52.190" style="s2">of things I have a game called context</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.180" end="00:04:55.030" style="s2">craft this is just with beeswax and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.190" end="00:04:57.590" style="s2">sticks that allows for the making of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.030" end="00:05:01.190" style="s2">three-dimensional geometries but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.590" end="00:05:04.070" style="s2">anything that&#39;s made using the sticks</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.190" end="00:05:07.130" style="s2">and beeswax can be replicated using</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.070" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">plastic bottles and sticks or even</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.130" end="00:05:13.160" style="s2">cardboard if it&#39;s appropriately treated</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:15.320" style="s2">in order to make large-scale structures</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.160" end="00:05:17.330" style="s2">so whatever you design through play and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.320" end="00:05:20.630" style="s2">through the game you can actually go on</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.330" end="00:05:23.150" style="s2">and make big so that&#39;s essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.630" end="00:05:26.740" style="s2">core of where I&#39;m at and what I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.150" end="00:05:29.240" style="s2">that present there&#39;s been a number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.740" end="00:05:31.160" style="s2">spin-off products that have come out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.240" end="00:05:34.700" style="s2">it which is one of the challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.160" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">issues that I have as as an inventor is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.700" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">I keep coming up with products and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">need assistance in getting these</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:45.500" style="s2">products out into the world that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:47.990" style="s2">can access them and use them but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.500" end="00:05:52.430" style="s2">been down the entrepreneurial path in</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.990" end="00:05:55.010" style="s2">the past and it&#39;s led me down into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.430" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">kind of management rabbit hole I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.010" end="00:06:00.050" style="s2">understood their marketing and the sales</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:01.930" style="s2">I built up international networks of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.050" end="00:06:05.690" style="s2">distribution with my previous company</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.930" end="00:06:07.700" style="s2">but it just doesn&#39;t interest me and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.690" end="00:06:09.830" style="s2">takes me away from what I&#39;m good at</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.700" end="00:06:12.670" style="s2">which is actually coming up with new</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.830" end="00:06:16.580" style="s2">designs new ideas and new solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.670" end="00:06:19.640" style="s2">and taking this kind of approach so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.580" end="00:06:21.590" style="s2">mean my core things that I&#39;m looking to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.640" end="00:06:24.220" style="s2">achieve I guess over the next hour is</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.590" end="00:06:29.030" style="s2">one is to just have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.220" end="00:06:32.300" style="s2">express what I&#39;m up to and and what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.030" end="00:06:35.210" style="s2">been doing over the last year and get</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.300" end="00:06:36.790" style="s2">some feedback on how clear it is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.210" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m about whether</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.790" end="00:06:42.940" style="s2">the message is really muddied or whether</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:46.630" style="s2">it&#39;s clear communication of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.940" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">actually doing and also find others that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.630" end="00:06:52.030" style="s2">can that are interested to actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:54.730" style="s2">start exploring some of these challenges</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.030" end="00:06:56.650" style="s2">that we have in order to find their own</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.730" end="00:06:59.230" style="s2">solutions discover and share their own</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.650" end="00:07:01.900" style="s2">solutions or perhaps copy some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.230" end="00:07:04.510" style="s2">the ideas and the learning that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.900" end="00:07:16.290" style="s2">been able to develop over the last year</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.510" end="00:07:16.290" style="s2">or so thank you sorry can someone else</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.550" end="00:07:27.250" style="s2">yeah I can I can continue on so J thanks</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.750" end="00:07:32.830" style="s2">for that it sounds like a good idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.250" end="00:07:35.020" style="s2">the world can use and ROI value from so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.830" end="00:07:37.330" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s awesome I think your</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.020" end="00:07:39.880" style="s2">initial description I I think I</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.330" end="00:07:44.170" style="s2">understood what you were doing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.880" end="00:07:46.150" style="s2">there&#39;s not a problem with like oh what</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.170" end="00:07:49.210" style="s2">what&#39;s this guy up to afterwards which a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.150" end="00:07:49.930" style="s2">lot of pitches have that initially so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.210" end="00:07:51.910" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.930" end="00:07:55.780" style="s2">I think there&#39;s I think there&#39;s a room</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.910" end="00:07:58.570" style="s2">for improvement as far as clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.780" end="00:08:02.550" style="s2">getting specific and of course it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.570" end="00:08:04.750" style="s2">like you also could use a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.550" end="00:08:07.270" style="s2">focus yourself I mean it sounds like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.750" end="00:08:10.390" style="s2">got a lot of options to go down and of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.270" end="00:08:12.600" style="s2">course you&#39;re only one person right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.390" end="00:08:12.600" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.050" end="00:08:18.520" style="s2">so let me so I don&#39;t know if if Ed Rio</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.140" end="00:08:20.380" style="s2">if you had anything you want any</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.520" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">questions about what he said or if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.380" end="00:08:23.740" style="s2">want to add anything and then other than</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:26.980" style="s2">that we can I can jump into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.740" end="00:08:28.150" style="s2">aspirations and sure yeah I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.980" end="00:08:30.520" style="s2">trying to understand I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.150" end="00:08:33.099" style="s2">separation but between what I understood</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.520" end="00:08:34.180" style="s2">was the eventual goal of the overall</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.099" end="00:08:37.410" style="s2">thing which sounded like it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.180" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">improving on efficient design</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.410" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">specifically or also to do with things</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:46.630" style="s2">generating habitats and then how that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">compares to what it sounded like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.630" end="00:08:50.050" style="s2">products like the stakes in the beeswax</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:54.930" style="s2">to to build structures and sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.050" end="00:08:57.339" style="s2">how those two work together or coincide</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.930" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">you know yeah so thanks for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.339" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">opportunity to clarify on that so</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">essentially what the the beeswax and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:11.709" style="s2">sticks is is allowing people to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:15.880" style="s2">start to explore geometry and understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.709" end="00:09:17.860" style="s2">how material structures can be created</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.880" end="00:09:20.649" style="s2">through geometry so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.860" end="00:09:23.709" style="s2">things like butt Minster Fuller and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.649" end="00:09:26.529" style="s2">he achieved with the the geodesic domes</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.709" end="00:09:29.290" style="s2">and various other forms that he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.529" end="00:09:33.010" style="s2">discovering and exploring a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.290" end="00:09:36.070" style="s2">learning comes from geometric play and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.010" end="00:09:38.680" style="s2">tactile play and haptic play and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.070" end="00:09:42.700" style="s2">something that we&#39;re not really teaching</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.680" end="00:09:45.940" style="s2">in schools so much nowadays so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.700" end="00:09:48.790" style="s2">the schools are leaning more towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.940" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">digital production at least from what</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.790" end="00:09:54.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve observed and also I ran a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.190" end="00:09:57.310" style="s2">makerspace in in Berlin I co-founded</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.300" end="00:09:59.800" style="s2">some years ago and again there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.310" end="00:10:02.829" style="s2">very strong leaning and a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.800" end="00:10:05.079" style="s2">drawer towards things like MakerBot&#39;s 3d</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.829" end="00:10:09.190" style="s2">printers laser cutters CNCs</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.079" end="00:10:14.079" style="s2">and things of that nature but what they</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.190" end="00:10:16.690" style="s2">need to is a complexity of construction</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.079" end="00:10:19.240" style="s2">so when when people start to think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:21.700" style="s2">how they solve problems and how they</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.240" end="00:10:24.520" style="s2">solve for problems instead of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.700" end="00:10:27.579" style="s2">the the materials lying around them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.520" end="00:10:29.860" style="s2">how they might use those materials in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.579" end="00:10:33.160" style="s2">order to meet their needs what they do</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.860" end="00:10:38.050" style="s2">is instead they they start to generally</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.160" end="00:10:41.380" style="s2">design in in the space of CAD or to try</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.050" end="00:10:43.209" style="s2">and find existing card things that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.380" end="00:10:46.600" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with CAD computer-aided</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.209" end="00:10:49.420" style="s2">design finding digital files and formats</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.600" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">that they can copy and produce and often</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.420" end="00:10:54.940" style="s2">they get more kind of distracted and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.910" end="00:10:57.370" style="s2">locked into this space where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.940" end="00:10:59.380" style="s2">tinkering with the machines themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.370" end="00:11:01.449" style="s2">and trying to replicate the machines</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.380" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">whilst actually the machines are quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.449" end="00:11:05.980" style="s2">limited in</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.940" end="00:11:08.110" style="s2">their capacity to build because of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.980" end="00:11:11.650" style="s2">surface areas that they&#39;re operating on</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.110" end="00:11:16.150" style="s2">and so on and so forth but by playing</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.650" end="00:11:19.390" style="s2">with the the beeswax and sticks on one</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.150" end="00:11:22.210" style="s2">hand this is a replicatable game so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.390" end="00:11:24.790" style="s2">anybody can produce it anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.210" end="00:11:26.710" style="s2">world you can order your own beeswax you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.790" end="00:11:29.590" style="s2">can order your own sticks you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.710" end="00:11:33.130" style="s2">produce your own game very easily and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.590" end="00:11:36.550" style="s2">very effectively but also where it has</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.130" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">been played friends have observed for</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.550" end="00:11:40.930" style="s2">example playing in Bedouin communities</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:43.300" style="s2">in the South Sinai one of them was with</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.930" end="00:11:45.220" style="s2">a architect student at the time and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.300" end="00:11:47.470" style="s2">architect student was commenting that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.220" end="00:11:50.400" style="s2">what the kids were doing they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.470" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">learn until the fourth year of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.400" end="00:11:57.340" style="s2">architecture so there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:11:59.770" style="s2">structure through playing with the hands</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.340" end="00:12:02.470" style="s2">and playing with physical geometry that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.770" end="00:12:05.980" style="s2">people come to understand what the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.470" end="00:12:08.110" style="s2">physical properties are of a material in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.980" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">order that they can understand how they</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.110" end="00:12:16.350" style="s2">can then build larger structures at</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.110" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">scale and also also to give them the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.350" end="00:12:22.110" style="s2">what&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:24.910" style="s2">belief that they can make things with</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.110" end="00:12:27.220" style="s2">their hands and that they&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.910" end="00:12:30.790" style="s2">making things with their hands because</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.220" end="00:12:35.190" style="s2">there&#39;s also an issue with our material</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.790" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">confidence and our material competence</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.190" end="00:12:40.060" style="s2">whenever we we look at things that other</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:41.950" style="s2">people have produced or whether we</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.060" end="00:12:44.890" style="s2">consider what we would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.950" end="00:12:47.010" style="s2">produce so this is also a response to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.890" end="00:12:49.810" style="s2">some of the challenges that I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.010" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">over the last few years and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.810" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">considering if I want to do a product</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:59.020" style="s2">such as a geodesic dome that anybody can</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:02.110" style="s2">produce or reproduce one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.020" end="00:13:06.130" style="s2">challenges I have to overcome is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.110" end="00:13:08.530" style="s2">material literacy and the material</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.130" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">relationship with the world because a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.530" end="00:13:13.000" style="s2">lot of people just don&#39;t have that tool</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:17.320" style="s2">so the game is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.000" end="00:13:20.200" style="s2">access point that gets people relating</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.320" end="00:13:24.400" style="s2">to the world again with their hands</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.200" end="00:13:27.430" style="s2">building up that set of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.400" end="00:13:29.860" style="s2">what I call material literacy that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.430" end="00:13:34.470" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily learn in a book that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.860" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">you can&#39;t necessarily even transfer over</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.470" end="00:13:41.980" style="s2">a video you need that actual tactile</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:44.740" style="s2">experience of the object and of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.980" end="00:13:47.500" style="s2">material reality in order to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.740" end="00:13:50.710" style="s2">it and understand how to relate to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.500" end="00:13:53.710" style="s2">and then once I&#39;ve built up that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.710" end="00:13:56.770" style="s2">relationship through the game whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.710" end="00:13:59.110" style="s2">is whatever is designed and I&#39;ll point</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.770" end="00:14:03.250" style="s2">you to the Instagram accounts and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.110" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">the images later or I can actually just</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.250" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">quickly I&#39;ll get you a larger shape it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:26.580" style="s2">gonna be easier to understand so for</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:30.089" style="s2">example this this dis larger form is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.580" end="00:14:33.370" style="s2">basic structure that can hold weight</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.089" end="00:14:35.800" style="s2">used as a structure for supporting</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.370" end="00:14:37.660" style="s2">stools and things like that larger</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.800" end="00:14:41.500" style="s2">versions of it have also been built to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.660" end="00:14:45.070" style="s2">when to suspend tables in a co-working</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.500" end="00:14:46.780" style="s2">space and co-working hub and that thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.070" end="00:14:52.020" style="s2">you just shared was that jazz bigger</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.780" end="00:14:52.020" style="s2">steps bigger sticks and duct tape no</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.460" end="00:15:05.650" style="s2">plastic bottles to make a weld and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.339" end="00:15:09.670" style="s2">that weld is then heat shrunk around the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.650" end="00:15:12.960" style="s2">around the sticks these are palm</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.670" end="00:15:16.690" style="s2">branches but you can also use it with</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.960" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">coppiced would for example depending on</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.690" end="00:15:21.820" style="s2">your location or when we were in London</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:23.800" style="s2">we I mean whilst there are trees in</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.820" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">London sticks are still hard to come by</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.800" end="00:15:26.810" style="s2">but when you walk down the streets</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:29.240" style="s2">everybody&#39;s throwing out</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.810" end="00:15:31.220" style="s2">cardboard boxes from Amazon so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.240" end="00:15:34.400" style="s2">discovered you can also shrink the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.220" end="00:15:36.500" style="s2">cardboard boxes you can make them into</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.400" end="00:15:38.660" style="s2">rolls you can then shrink those rolls</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.500" end="00:15:39.260" style="s2">into bottles and again you can make</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.660" end="00:15:42.050" style="s2">sturdy</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.260" end="00:15:46.790" style="s2">Strix stick structure that can then be</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.050" end="00:15:48.920" style="s2">used to make scaffolding either for</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.790" end="00:15:52.310" style="s2">domes or it could be structures that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.920" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">vines can grow around because if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.310" end="00:15:59.570" style="s2">increase the accessible surface area</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:01.339" style="s2">outside of buildings for example using</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.570" end="00:16:05.300" style="s2">these joining techniques then we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.339" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">create surfaces that shade and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.300" end="00:16:10.580" style="s2">habitat can grow around so it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:13.700" style="s2">possible to explore how we might also</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.580" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">adapt the existing environments and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.700" end="00:16:19.970" style="s2">existing buildings that we&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">using these techniques so for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.970" end="00:16:24.070" style="s2">you could take a model of your house you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:26.900" style="s2">could play with it you could explore</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.070" end="00:16:29.510" style="s2">using the wax and sticks what some</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.900" end="00:16:31.760" style="s2">aesthetic geometries around the outside</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.510" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">could look like and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.760" end="00:16:35.300" style="s2">actually create those structures and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:39.160" style="s2">create shade around the outside of your</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.300" end="00:16:41.690" style="s2">house or better still grow shade grow</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.160" end="00:16:44.660" style="s2">vertical gardens but I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.690" end="00:16:47.180" style="s2">vines rather than trying to plant trees</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.660" end="00:16:50.270" style="s2">in the sky because vines are the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.180" end="00:16:52.280" style="s2">vertical vertical farming methods that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.270" end="00:16:55.330" style="s2">we already have they produce shade they</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.280" end="00:16:57.350" style="s2">produce crops and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.330" end="00:17:02.390" style="s2">challenges that we&#39;re going to face</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.350" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">going forward are related to this this</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.390" end="00:17:09.170" style="s2">problem of things getting too hot and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:10.699" style="s2">actually things can be if we put all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.170" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">our energy into pumping the heat away</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.699" end="00:17:14.390" style="s2">from the buildings we&#39;re putting the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:17.480" style="s2">we&#39;re putting the thinking into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.390" end="00:17:19.459" style="s2">challenge at the wrong stage the the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.480" end="00:17:22.339" style="s2">challenge is actually just stopping the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.459" end="00:17:23.780" style="s2">Sun from hitting the building because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.339" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t absorb the heat in the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.780" end="00:17:28.040" style="s2">place then you don&#39;t have to put the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:32.770" style="s2">energy into getting it out so by</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.040" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">creating these these structures around</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.770" end="00:17:38.390" style="s2">our existing buildings and our existing</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.950" style="s2">dwellings and then growing habitat</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.390" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">growing plants</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.950" end="00:17:49.580" style="s2">growing shade or creating shade through</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:53.510" style="s2">other forms we can actually reduce a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.580" end="00:17:55.790" style="s2">of our energy costs and also create a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.510" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">more comfortable environment as well as</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.790" end="00:18:00.980" style="s2">potentially creating opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:18:03.260" style="s2">for crops and various other things so</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.980" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">does that make a bit more sense now as</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.260" end="00:18:10.610" style="s2">to how these things have it how this</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:14.270" style="s2">kind of wax wax geometry kind of plays</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.610" end="00:18:16.700" style="s2">out and and scales to something larger I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.270" end="00:18:18.500" style="s2">think so if I understand you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.700" end="00:18:20.510" style="s2">that the game sort of helps build like</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.500" end="00:18:22.010" style="s2">the mental ability like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.510" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">understanding of you know what shapes</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.010" end="00:18:26.210" style="s2">working don&#39;t and also you know people</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:28.520" style="s2">how to work with the physical materials</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.210" end="00:18:29.960" style="s2">as opposed to CAD which then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.520" end="00:18:33.650" style="s2">you know how to get that into the real</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.960" end="00:18:36.770" style="s2">world and that is moving towards sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.650" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">a system where these structures it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.770" end="00:18:39.800" style="s2">sounds like at least for now wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.150" end="00:18:41.480" style="s2">new buildings but rather things tacked</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.800" end="00:18:45.640" style="s2">on to existing buildings to help achieve</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.480" end="00:18:48.260" style="s2">this you know any more efficient did to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.640" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">his I&#39;m with helping with the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.260" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">thermal comfort as you called it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:19:04.130" style="s2">then also providing a place for</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:19:09.110" style="s2">creatures to live I mean the environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.130" end="00:19:11.690" style="s2">I mean for example where I am in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.110" end="00:19:14.510" style="s2">a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot of land</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.690" end="00:19:16.910" style="s2">available but there&#39;s a problem building</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.510" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">on that land due to government</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.910" end="00:19:25.010" style="s2">regulation paperwork issues also family</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:27.980" style="s2">access to money and various other things</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.010" end="00:19:30.650" style="s2">so and they also have a lot of flat</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.980" end="00:19:34.520" style="s2">rooftops which are again just catching</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.650" end="00:19:36.650" style="s2">the heat of the Sun so where I am there</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.520" end="00:19:39.950" style="s2">is also an opportunity for the creation</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.650" end="00:19:43.130" style="s2">of kind of like and and dome-like</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.950" end="00:19:45.680" style="s2">structures on the flat roof but in more</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.130" end="00:19:49.180" style="s2">kind of I guess Western urban</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.680" end="00:19:53.410" style="s2">environments then it&#39;s more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.180" end="00:19:57.660" style="s2">retrofit structures and exploring how</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.410" end="00:20:00.670" style="s2">you can create more capacity for growth</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.660" end="00:20:04.900" style="s2">on the outside of the existing</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.670" end="00:20:06.730" style="s2">structures and existing dwellings so Jay</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.900" end="00:20:09.700" style="s2">I wonder if you would wouldn&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.730" end="00:20:12.910" style="s2">giving me your kind of the initial</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.700" end="00:20:15.880" style="s2">message again maybe like one or two</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.910" end="00:20:19.680" style="s2">sentences because I want to tie that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.880" end="00:20:19.680" style="s2">back to what we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.970" end="00:20:35.770" style="s2">the in essence is looking at how we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.910" end="00:20:41.020" style="s2">how we can what is and and where we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.770" end="00:20:44.910" style="s2">and to use that to grow shade and grow</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.020" end="00:20:48.850" style="s2">food and increase the available habitat</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.910" end="00:20:53.050" style="s2">for other beings other than humans alone</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:20:55.180" style="s2">because there&#39;s also an issue that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.050" end="00:20:57.880" style="s2">have like our cities are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.180" end="00:21:00.280" style="s2">desert evolving and a lot of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.880" end="00:21:02.560" style="s2">that we have with wildlife depletion</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.280" end="00:21:06.970" style="s2">insect depletion and various other</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.560" end="00:21:09.790" style="s2">things are as a direct result of of how</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.970" end="00:21:12.670" style="s2">we relate to our overall environment and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.790" end="00:21:16.690" style="s2">how we relate to nature so to make this</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.670" end="00:21:21.730" style="s2">kind of switch to turn our sterile</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.690" end="00:21:36.040" style="s2">spaces into abundant spaces of of growth</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.730" end="00:21:40.930" style="s2">and food shade and shelter okay so would</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.040" end="00:21:48.690" style="s2">you say that that if you had like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.930" end="00:21:52.770" style="s2">catch phrase for it it would be growing</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.690" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">growing chain food using what we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.770" end="00:22:08.280" style="s2">today is my my general mantra that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:10.680" style="s2">I&#39;m applying because also when you look</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.280" end="00:22:14.460" style="s2">at the the co2 in the atmosphere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.680" end="00:22:16.440" style="s2">essentially life in waiting all all all</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.460" end="00:22:20.010" style="s2">life is made out of carbon there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.440" end="00:22:22.590" style="s2">of thinking about how we need to sink or</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.010" end="00:22:27.750" style="s2">lock but again there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.590" end="00:22:29.970" style="s2">engineering approaches to the the carbon</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.750" end="00:22:33.450" style="s2">that we we have in the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.970" end="00:22:36.930" style="s2">but what nature does is it turns that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.450" end="00:22:39.000" style="s2">carbon into life and that the more life</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.930" end="00:22:40.590" style="s2">we create the more shade we create the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.000" end="00:22:44.870" style="s2">more habitat we create and these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.590" end="00:22:47.310" style="s2">positive feedback loops that cool down</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.870" end="00:22:48.900" style="s2">our cities they cool down our</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.310" end="00:22:52.170" style="s2">environments and they can also produce</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.900" end="00:22:53.670" style="s2">food as a by-product and as well as</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.170" end="00:22:56.100" style="s2">reducing the carbon I mean basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.670" end="00:22:58.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot required before we get</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.100" end="00:23:00.120" style="s2">anywhere close to really addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.680" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">issue and it&#39;s not that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.120" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">address the issue also at the source but</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:08.010" style="s2">looking at what is and how we transform</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:11.970" style="s2">it into something that&#39;s useful to us</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.010" end="00:23:15.290" style="s2">and to everything else yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.970" end="00:23:19.500" style="s2">keep common girl habitat is a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.290" end="00:23:22.350" style="s2">phrase that would draw interest and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.500" end="00:23:25.350" style="s2">something I would suggest go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.350" end="00:23:27.480" style="s2">crafting that that one sentence thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.350" end="00:23:30.420" style="s2">when you&#39;ve piqued people&#39;s interest to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.480" end="00:23:32.430" style="s2">kind of really simplify in their mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.420" end="00:23:34.500" style="s2">something like grocery and food food</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.430" end="00:23:37.080" style="s2">using what we have to benefit us and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.500" end="00:23:39.680" style="s2">animals and insects or you know however</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.080" end="00:23:42.870" style="s2">you want to say that that other thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.680" end="00:23:45.330" style="s2">and and then like you know other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.870" end="00:23:48.770" style="s2">benefits after that like your sterile to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.330" end="00:23:51.090" style="s2">abundance for food and shade and shelter</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.770" end="00:23:53.550" style="s2">which you you might be able to combine</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.090" end="00:23:55.530" style="s2">those into one but I think it&#39;s great to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.550" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">have in priority just a couple short</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.530" end="00:24:03.090" style="s2">sentences to give people the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:05.070" style="s2">of your project because if it does</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.090" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">everything for everyone you can&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.070" end="00:24:10.020" style="s2">that in your brain but sounds like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:12.870" style="s2">like you do have a good thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.020" end="00:24:16.230" style="s2">unless you want more specific help on</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.870" end="00:24:17.320" style="s2">that I would like to dive into some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.230" end="00:24:21.399" style="s2">the challenges you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.320" end="00:24:25.029" style="s2">about finding other people and you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.399" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">a lot of kind of product ideas that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.029" end="00:24:30.340" style="s2">you don&#39;t want you&#39;re not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:31.899" style="s2">being the person to bring them to market</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.340" end="00:24:34.750" style="s2">but you feel there&#39;s a value and there</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.899" end="00:24:45.009" style="s2">is there an a preference and where you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.750" end="00:24:46.860" style="s2">like to go in terms of where I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.009" end="00:24:50.620" style="s2">like to go with it</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.860" end="00:24:55.929" style="s2">aye-aye-aye my kind of drive isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.620" end="00:24:58.750" style="s2">monetary a tool and obviously yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.929" end="00:25:01.389" style="s2">have certain needs I have a family to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.750" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">take care of anything else but I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.389" end="00:25:07.480" style="s2">lucky enough to be in a position of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:10.029" style="s2">privilege now this year whereby we</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.480" end="00:25:13.269" style="s2">finally actually got some land and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.029" end="00:25:16.529" style="s2">house for ourselves so it&#39;s it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.269" end="00:25:19.960" style="s2">paramount as it as it once was</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.529" end="00:25:22.149" style="s2">what I want to see is these these</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.960" end="00:25:26.889" style="s2">products out in the wild I want to see</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.149" end="00:25:29.220" style="s2">them benefiting other people and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.889" end="00:25:34.059" style="s2">other people are able to generate income</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.220" end="00:25:36.370" style="s2">stress around them and preferably using</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.059" end="00:25:39.330" style="s2">local production and local craft</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.370" end="00:25:43.269" style="s2">methodologies so I&#39;m also looking at</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.330" end="00:25:48.059" style="s2">providing an alternative to the mass</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.269" end="00:25:52.090" style="s2">production kind of habits and behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.059" end="00:25:54.669" style="s2">that we&#39;re already exhibiting it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.090" end="00:25:58.659" style="s2">to say that we wouldn&#39;t necessarily use</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.669" end="00:26:00.730" style="s2">as production methods as they as they</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.659" end="00:26:05.860" style="s2">stand sometimes they are of benefit</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.730" end="00:26:08.110" style="s2">everything has its is context but to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.860" end="00:26:12.940" style="s2">create opportunities for craftspeople</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.110" end="00:26:15.460" style="s2">and an artisans and because although the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.940" end="00:26:21.879" style="s2">products in question are also designed</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.460" end="00:26:25.629" style="s2">to reduce our damage to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.879" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">and and and create further opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.629" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">so I can I can give you an example of</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:33.490" style="s2">that this is this is going to make less</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:37.180" style="s2">which is why sometimes it&#39;s difficult in</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.490" end="00:26:40.030" style="s2">this in this narrative but a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.180" end="00:26:43.690" style="s2">years ago I did a product called the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.030" end="00:26:47.140" style="s2">beta book which is a portable whiteboard</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.690" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">and so it folds up like a notebook and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.140" end="00:26:56.040" style="s2">then inside it you&#39;ve got a whiteboard</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:27:01.560" style="s2">so this is a open-source version which</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.040" end="00:27:05.650" style="s2">which anybody can actually produce and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.560" end="00:27:09.280" style="s2">so this is this is one example product</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.650" end="00:27:12.250" style="s2">this is mommy folding paper techniques</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.280" end="00:27:15.130" style="s2">and things that anybody can buy in any</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.250" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">craft store so it&#39;s not that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.130" end="00:27:18.670" style="s2">would necessarily just because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:20.290" style="s2">produce your own doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.670" end="00:27:22.690" style="s2">everybody should produce arraign a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.290" end="00:27:25.420" style="s2">of people still want to consume but then</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.690" end="00:27:28.780" style="s2">there&#39;s opportunities for artisans or</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.420" end="00:27:31.420" style="s2">people to produce that product likewise</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.780" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">the the the game again just because</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.420" end="00:27:36.340" style="s2">people can produce it themselves doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:38.230" style="s2">mean they&#39;re necessarily going to want</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.340" end="00:27:39.700" style="s2">to produce it themselves so again</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.230" end="00:27:42.040" style="s2">there&#39;s an opportunity there for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:45.460" style="s2">people to produce their own versions of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.040" end="00:27:47.410" style="s2">the game and distribute the game and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.460" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">profit from the distribution of the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.410" end="00:27:56.950" style="s2">and so this is one of the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:28:01.810" style="s2">challenges and opportunities shall we</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.950" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">say in how to give these give these</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.810" end="00:28:05.350" style="s2">products away that other people can</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.860" style="s2">produce them other people can benefit</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.350" end="00:28:10.690" style="s2">from them perhaps under a common brand</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:13.690" style="s2">so I would imagine them coming together</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.690" end="00:28:17.080" style="s2">under a common website and there may</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.690" end="00:28:18.850" style="s2">need to be a separation between projects</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.080" end="00:28:21.490" style="s2">in order to allow this to happen so this</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.850" end="00:28:23.020" style="s2">is where things get a bit muddy so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.490" end="00:28:27.400" style="s2">get clarity and then I get muddy again</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.020" end="00:28:33.370" style="s2">so apologies for that it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.400" end="00:28:35.140" style="s2">issues that I that I face as I discover</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.370" end="00:28:38.410" style="s2">things all of the time that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.140" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">benefit to other people and but the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.410" end="00:28:43.630" style="s2">market is largely geared towards mass</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:46.270" style="s2">production so I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.630" end="00:28:48.760" style="s2">alternative ways and alternative systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.270" end="00:28:52.980" style="s2">to actually bring these ideas to market</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.760" end="00:28:55.180" style="s2">that local makers can benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.980" end="00:28:58.210" style="s2">producing them local craftsmen and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.180" end="00:28:59.860" style="s2">benefit from producing them and and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.210" end="00:29:02.530" style="s2">people can still access them easily</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.860" end="00:29:05.800" style="s2">because no just because you can make it</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.530" end="00:29:08.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you want to right and these</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.800" end="00:29:10.780" style="s2">products is the I is the idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.950" end="00:29:12.900" style="s2">would sort of be different iterations of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.780" end="00:29:16.120" style="s2">something that you would make with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.900" end="00:29:17.650" style="s2">the prototyping game you showed like if</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.120" end="00:29:19.330" style="s2">for example you make some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.650" end="00:29:21.430" style="s2">geodesic dome that I don&#39;t know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.330" end="00:29:23.110" style="s2">good for bees or something you make a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.430" end="00:29:26.140" style="s2">kit around that and then that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.110" end="00:29:29.740" style="s2">sold that that would be that would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.140" end="00:29:32.110" style="s2">one that would be one branching and one</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.740" end="00:29:36.490" style="s2">path I guess right this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.110" end="00:29:39.220" style="s2">always the issue is sometimes sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.490" end="00:29:42.460" style="s2">the game may lead to two to a large</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.220" end="00:29:45.250" style="s2">product so yeah so you&#39;ve got so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.460" end="00:29:48.420" style="s2">list a few the the game then once we</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.250" end="00:29:53.580" style="s2">have the game once we have the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.420" end="00:29:57.100" style="s2">geodesic yet and then as a larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.580" end="00:29:58.690" style="s2">product that could be produced it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.100" end="00:30:01.960" style="s2">of related to the game but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.690" end="00:30:07.660" style="s2">different set of tools and techniques in</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.960" end="00:30:10.660" style="s2">order to produce it this is a kid&#39;s toy</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.660" end="00:30:15.040" style="s2">was designed in the game it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.660" end="00:30:17.530" style="s2">kind of bird made from recycled plastic</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.040" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">bottles that flaps its wings when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.530" end="00:30:23.770" style="s2">when you pull the string not really</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:27.280" style="s2">useful much other than entertaining the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.770" end="00:30:28.840" style="s2">kids and something for shadowplay you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.280" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">can also get some very interest in</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:36.150" style="s2">shadow puppetry and various other things</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:40.230" style="s2">but each each of these things is its own</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.150" end="00:30:44.410" style="s2">branch and whilst the the game may be</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.230" end="00:30:46.840" style="s2">how I arrived at them and how I come to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.410" end="00:30:49.630" style="s2">design and they each actually come with</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.840" end="00:30:52.510" style="s2">their own skill sets for their</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.630" end="00:30:53.800" style="s2">individual production okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.510" end="00:30:55.390" style="s2">so it sounds a bit like there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.800" end="00:30:57.100" style="s2">two levels where one would just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.390" end="00:30:58.630" style="s2">be like giving somebody a big bucket of</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.100" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">leggo that you could build a trillion</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.630" end="00:31:02.110" style="s2">things out of and then the next level</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:03.970" style="s2">those kids versus here here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.110" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">spaceship there&#39;s 80 pieces that build a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.970" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">spaceship it&#39;s specifically for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">purpose yeah wondering whether you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:16.299" style="s2">catalogue of products like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:17.530" style="s2">the things that you have made and want</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.299" end="00:31:19.780" style="s2">to be available people to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.530" end="00:31:22.840" style="s2">themselves or for local people to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.780" end="00:31:24.760" style="s2">themself for their own profit do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.840" end="00:31:27.730" style="s2">want them to stay separate and in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.760" end="00:31:30.630" style="s2">own catalogue on their own website their</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.730" end="00:31:32.470" style="s2">own you know stores or do you want them</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.630" end="00:31:33.970" style="s2">intermingled with other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.470" end="00:31:35.830" style="s2">products and other people&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.970" end="00:31:37.330" style="s2">thinking of like a 3d library that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.830" end="00:31:38.710" style="s2">a you know it&#39;s not a 3d printing</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.330" end="00:31:40.330" style="s2">library but something that&#39;s like hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.710" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">you can build this yourself and team up</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.330" end="00:31:45.419" style="s2">with other people so you can bulk buy</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:47.340" style="s2">the products and and you know have a DIY</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.419" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">workshop where you&#39;re all building</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.340" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">foldable whiteboards together right</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:56.130" style="s2">here&#39;s the material here&#39;s that no I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:58.870" style="s2">would I would love to I mean my</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.130" end="00:32:00.789" style="s2">intention is really once the once once</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.870" end="00:32:03.730" style="s2">the system is working I want this to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.789" end="00:32:06.280" style="s2">something that other inventors and can</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.730" end="00:32:10.360" style="s2">also share their ideas through but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.280" end="00:32:12.730" style="s2">that others can actually build upon the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.360" end="00:32:17.500" style="s2">ideas that everybody contributes and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.730" end="00:32:21.340" style="s2">puts into the the common product pool so</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.500" end="00:32:23.770" style="s2">to speak so to take the whiteboard for</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.340" end="00:32:27.280" style="s2">example as a case in point there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.770" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole load of very easy design</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.280" end="00:32:33.850" style="s2">hacks that can be made simply by</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:35.770" style="s2">printing different artworks by different</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.850" end="00:32:38.200" style="s2">designers and then folding those pages</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.770" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s an easy adaptation other</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.200" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">people can build upon also the inside</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:48.220" style="s2">layers can be replaced and switched out</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">so you can add anything from drawings</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.220" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">that kids can can draw and color and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:33:00.850" style="s2">then color again through to business</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:02.200" style="s2">canvasses and SWOT analysis where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.850" end="00:33:05.409" style="s2">kind of old school but you know like</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.200" end="00:33:08.830" style="s2">business padding canvas sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.409" end="00:33:10.400" style="s2">canvas different processes that could</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.830" end="00:33:13.010" style="s2">appeal to an entire</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.400" end="00:33:16.910" style="s2">a different market and an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.010" end="00:33:19.220" style="s2">different market niche so the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.910" end="00:33:21.160" style="s2">really I would like to see is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.220" end="00:33:25.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a space where other people can</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.160" end="00:33:28.580" style="s2">can build on and can can adapt and share</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.730" end="00:33:33.080" style="s2">their adaptations and share their</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.580" end="00:33:36.200" style="s2">designs and also be rewarded for and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.080" end="00:33:38.510" style="s2">derive a benefit for putting those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.200" end="00:33:41.420" style="s2">out into those spaces where where they</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.510" end="00:33:43.940" style="s2">should need it and because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.420" end="00:33:47.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.940" end="00:33:49.550" style="s2">in this in this in this challenge I</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.110" end="00:33:51.710" style="s2">there are other inventors and other</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.550" end="00:33:56.450" style="s2">entrepreneurs out there that I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.710" end="00:34:00.680" style="s2">suffer continuously from this because of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:02.930" style="s2">the the systems of investment and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.680" end="00:34:05.590" style="s2">the means of reaching the market</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.930" end="00:34:08.270" style="s2">essentially mean that we have to and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.590" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">present ideas in a way that&#39;s viable</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.270" end="00:34:16.580" style="s2">only to commercial interests and then it</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:18.820" style="s2">needs to be at a sufficient scale to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.580" end="00:34:22.010" style="s2">worth we invest are taking the risk and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.820" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">an inventor isn&#39;t or the entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.010" end="00:34:27.740" style="s2">isn&#39;t rich to to begin with then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:30.230" style="s2">investor takes a punt that the investor</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.740" end="00:34:32.419" style="s2">wins because they spread their bear but</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.230" end="00:34:33.950" style="s2">the entrepreneur or the inventor they</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.419" end="00:34:35.810" style="s2">put their sweat and their time into</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.950" end="00:34:39.080" style="s2">creating the idea to discovering the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.810" end="00:34:43.820" style="s2">idea and and ultimately they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.080" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">necessarily have a stake so it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.820" end="00:34:51.710" style="s2">requires an insanity of some form to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.710" end="00:34:54.350" style="s2">actually go down this path I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.710" end="00:34:56.870" style="s2">went down this path because I was young</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.350" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">and naive but because I&#39;ve fallen so far</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.870" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">out the system I can&#39;t get back and but</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:06.020" style="s2">when I&#39;ve worked with entrepreneurs and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:08.360" style="s2">inventors in places like Egypt and Sri</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.020" end="00:35:11.990" style="s2">Lanka their families are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.360" end="00:35:15.170" style="s2">pulling them towards more stable jobs</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.990" end="00:35:17.270" style="s2">and more stable civil service positions</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.170" end="00:35:20.360" style="s2">and to be quite honest they&#39;re right to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.270" end="00:35:22.490" style="s2">do so because there&#39;s no social safety</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.360" end="00:35:23.670" style="s2">net for them and their families are also</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.490" end="00:35:26.130" style="s2">dependent on their</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.670" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">future and it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.130" end="00:35:29.910" style="s2">entrepreneur or the inventor that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:33.030" style="s2">risk if they up excuse my language</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.910" end="00:35:36.990" style="s2">but it&#39;s some creating an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.030" end="00:35:40.319" style="s2">space for people that have ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.990" end="00:35:42.510" style="s2">that are looking into things especially</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.319" end="00:35:46.430" style="s2">like sustainability where we do need</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.510" end="00:35:50.250" style="s2">alternative solutions we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.430" end="00:35:53.130" style="s2">discover and find the alternatives and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.250" end="00:35:55.470" style="s2">bring them to market but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.130" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">the existing market model is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.470" end="00:36:00.020" style="s2">sufficient in order to bring about all</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.599" end="00:36:03.720" style="s2">of the changes that we need to discover</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.020" end="00:36:04.859" style="s2">does that make sense yeah that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.720" end="00:36:07.140" style="s2">really similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.859" end="00:36:09.540" style="s2">Jubilees been suggesting and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.140" end="00:36:12.599" style="s2">working with honor and this together</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.540" end="00:36:14.730" style="s2">tact now ours was specifically focused</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.599" end="00:36:18.540" style="s2">for tech but we&#39;re hitting those same</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.730" end="00:36:20.430" style="s2">issues where the pooling resources for</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.540" end="00:36:22.290" style="s2">marketing and that&#39;s an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.430" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">and I think we&#39;ve also discussed pulling</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.290" end="00:36:27.240" style="s2">resources for distributing the risk like</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:32.099" style="s2">you suggested so those are all great</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.240" end="00:36:34.410" style="s2">ideas I did want to dive back more into</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.099" end="00:36:36.930" style="s2">this into your specific situation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.410" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">throw some ideas out that you may have</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.930" end="00:36:42.900" style="s2">already considered and discarded for one</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:48.270" style="s2">reason or another do you mind if I throw</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.900" end="00:36:51.660" style="s2">some ideas out so I the the thing seems</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.270" end="00:36:53.640" style="s2">like in your kind of priority list I</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.660" end="00:36:55.230" style="s2">would say your most important thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.640" end="00:36:58.069" style="s2">you want to accomplish is to get the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.230" end="00:37:00.780" style="s2">information out there and get it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.069" end="00:37:03.569" style="s2">popularized as we was saying or make it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.780" end="00:37:05.220" style="s2">more common and accessible because like</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.569" end="00:37:08.670" style="s2">you said you&#39;re not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.220" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">necessarily making money as a craftsman</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.670" end="00:37:13.049" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s part of it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:16.230" style="s2">your larger goal of getting it out to</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.049" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">the world is your primary one if I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.230" end="00:37:23.130" style="s2">in that situation one thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:25.589" style="s2">probably consider is is to have a you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.130" end="00:37:28.500" style="s2">website and a YouTube channel where</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.589" end="00:37:31.230" style="s2">you&#39;re just creating videos on how to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.500" end="00:37:33.270" style="s2">all the stuff and building up that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.230" end="00:37:37.349" style="s2">content now that doesn&#39;t get you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.270" end="00:37:37.770" style="s2">anywhere to that yeah that might be like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.349" end="00:37:39.390" style="s2">the FIR</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.770" end="00:37:41.820" style="s2">generation and maybe even having a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.390" end="00:37:44.450" style="s2">patreon for people that or some other</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.820" end="00:37:48.540" style="s2">funding models where people can donate</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.450" end="00:37:51.090" style="s2">for supporting your cause and and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.540" end="00:37:55.350" style="s2">give you the recent I&#39;m and money to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.090" end="00:37:57.710" style="s2">make that content either video or also</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.350" end="00:38:00.840" style="s2">just written content on a website and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.710" end="00:38:03.060" style="s2">then we can we can discuss the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.840" end="00:38:11.700" style="s2">steps but have you considered that yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.060" end="00:38:16.590" style="s2">already yeah that we were going to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.700" end="00:38:20.030" style="s2">this chat as an opportunity to start to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.590" end="00:38:22.290" style="s2">collect the information together into</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.030" end="00:38:25.890" style="s2">into a website so I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.290" end="00:38:27.870" style="s2">articulate and make the ideas accessible</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.890" end="00:38:32.760" style="s2">more clearly so I&#39;ve started playing</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.870" end="00:38:36.180" style="s2">about with web slow today and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.760" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">activating some very very fast old</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.180" end="00:38:47.220" style="s2">skills long ago forgotten and I&#39;ve begun</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:49.980" style="s2">I think definitely something then</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.220" end="00:38:54.780" style="s2">patreon is also something that I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.980" end="00:38:57.840" style="s2">considered so it&#39;s this I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.780" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">one of the declare next steps for me is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.840" end="00:39:03.780" style="s2">to get the website done get up what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:06.630" style="s2">already done over the last year in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.780" end="00:39:08.310" style="s2">in in this framework one that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.630" end="00:39:11.430" style="s2">things I&#39;m not sure about still is</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.310" end="00:39:16.730" style="s2">whether the the overall the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.430" end="00:39:22.980" style="s2">narrative fits all of the products that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.730" end="00:39:27.950" style="s2">are being created so this is something</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.980" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">that I still need to kind of explore is</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.950" end="00:39:32.730" style="s2">it&#39;s always having these clear threads</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:37.400" style="s2">but I I think that&#39;s definitely one</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.730" end="00:39:40.440" style="s2">channel that needs to be explored I</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.400" end="00:39:43.890" style="s2">think with YouTube one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.440" end="00:39:48.180" style="s2">want to ensure though is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.890" end="00:39:51.630" style="s2">there&#39;s some feedback loop that actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.180" end="00:39:54.830" style="s2">ensures that people don&#39;t just what</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.630" end="00:39:58.680" style="s2">and then go oh that&#39;s nice and share it</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.830" end="00:40:01.290" style="s2">but there&#39;s to create a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.680" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">where they&#39;re also motivated to recreate</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.290" end="00:40:07.890" style="s2">it and and then share evidence that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:10.020" style="s2">actually made it in the in in the real</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.890" end="00:40:11.670" style="s2">world so I&#39;ve been exploring like game</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.020" end="00:40:15.330" style="s2">dynamics with respect to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.670" end="00:40:16.710" style="s2">relationship that it&#39;s kind of working</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.330" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">out these incentives that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.710" end="00:40:22.020" style="s2">actually want to copy it because you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:24.540" style="s2">often get in this space of illusion of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.020" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">people share stuff and then there you go</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.540" end="00:40:32.070" style="s2">that&#39;s nice and then they share it on</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:34.680" style="s2">Facebook that&#39;s the action they take I</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.070" end="00:40:37.430" style="s2">mean if you had if you had one out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.680" end="00:40:41.430" style="s2">every person that sees it created it</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.430" end="00:40:44.130" style="s2">yeah if you have 99 people sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.430" end="00:40:46.530" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna reach those 1% to do do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.130" end="00:40:50.700" style="s2">sooner so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think at</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.530" end="00:40:52.890" style="s2">anytime you&#39;d want to say I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.700" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">to have the the shares for the people</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.890" end="00:40:58.370" style="s2">that don&#39;t use it but yes sending any</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:01.860" style="s2">way that you can you can phrase it or</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.370" end="00:41:04.050" style="s2">encourage the actual participation of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.860" end="00:41:06.120" style="s2">and if you have a website and a YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.050" end="00:41:07.890" style="s2">channel and you simply say hey make one</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.120" end="00:41:11.760" style="s2">send me a video clip and I&#39;ll do a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.890" end="00:41:14.490" style="s2">compilation video or I&#39;ll give you video</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">feedback on your thon I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.490" end="00:41:31.800" style="s2">great incentive for people to or to show</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:33.420" style="s2">your ideas you know for me I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.800" end="00:41:34.770" style="s2">exactly how the Instagram works so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.420" end="00:41:36.900" style="s2">can&#39;t speak if this could be done on</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.770" end="00:41:38.280" style="s2">Instagram but like on Facebook having a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.900" end="00:41:40.440" style="s2">Facebook group or you have the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.280" end="00:41:42.810" style="s2">videos and then other people can post</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.440" end="00:41:44.460" style="s2">their video or their photo of what they</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.810" end="00:41:48.270" style="s2">created within that and so it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.460" end="00:41:50.130" style="s2">community of people who are trying these</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.270" end="00:41:54.030" style="s2">things right trying the iteration it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.130" end="00:41:55.290" style="s2">part of like that&#39;s a piece of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.030" end="00:41:56.850" style="s2">right even if you wouldn&#39;t make the bird</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.290" end="00:41:58.410" style="s2">on a stick because you don&#39;t have a kid</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.850" end="00:42:00.600" style="s2">for it to do they might make it for</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.410" end="00:42:02.010" style="s2">being part of that community right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.600" end="00:42:04.170" style="s2">having one a month for one a week</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.010" end="00:42:05.500" style="s2">whatever your capacity is so that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.170" end="00:42:07.330" style="s2">is the one people or</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.500" end="00:42:08.740" style="s2">xenon and then people can always hear I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.330" end="00:42:09.970" style="s2">mean they come in a month late and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.740" end="00:42:11.350" style="s2">make the bird one and it&#39;s a month ago</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.970" end="00:42:15.700" style="s2">they can still post it and have people</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.350" end="00:42:18.010" style="s2">comment yep a lot of trainers on on</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.700" end="00:42:21.580" style="s2">YouTube like 3d modeling they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.010" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">weekly contests and so and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.580" end="00:42:25.540" style="s2">even have to actually give anything you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:30.820" style="s2">just say oh I like this one the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.540" end="00:42:33.300" style="s2">right that&#39;s basically of like yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.820" end="00:42:36.430" style="s2">like my channel now you&#39;re on it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.300" end="00:42:37.720" style="s2">but yeah so have a lot of people create</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.430" end="00:42:39.100" style="s2">you know so you could have a design</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.720" end="00:42:41.410" style="s2">challenge here&#39;s a problem that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.100" end="00:42:44.050" style="s2">are having providing shade how would you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.410" end="00:42:46.060" style="s2">use these tools to do that or another</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.050" end="00:42:47.770" style="s2">week saying you know let&#39;s let&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.060" end="00:42:50.950" style="s2">make this one shape and who can decorate</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.770" end="00:42:52.390" style="s2">it the best all right because you want</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.950" end="00:42:54.190" style="s2">because you want these dolls would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.390" end="00:42:56.200" style="s2">aesthetically pleasing just little</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.190" end="00:43:11.070" style="s2">competitions like that I think would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.200" end="00:43:13.300" style="s2">a lot of fun yeah a time-based</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.070" end="00:43:17.140" style="s2">one of the things we&#39;ve been exploring</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.300" end="00:43:20.860" style="s2">quite a lot with the the game shadow</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.140" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">play so you cannot transform the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.860" end="00:43:26.320" style="s2">entire inside space actually by taking</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:29.470" style="s2">these geometries and then shining</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.320" end="00:43:31.900" style="s2">shining light freedom and you can then</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.470" end="00:43:35.350" style="s2">actually see the the structures on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.900" end="00:43:37.360" style="s2">walls of the room around you and make</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.350" end="00:43:40.030" style="s2">your own shadow puppets so for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.360" end="00:43:43.990" style="s2">that was what the bird was about so if</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.030" end="00:43:46.390" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s like a weekly story and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.990" end="00:43:48.580" style="s2">there&#39;s challenges connected to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.390" end="00:43:51.730" style="s2">weekly story and then people are invited</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.580" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">to create different characters or</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.730" end="00:43:58.360" style="s2">archetypes or different structures and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:01.960" style="s2">parts of the overall storytelling like</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.360" end="00:44:05.110" style="s2">scenes then as the incentive to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.960" end="00:44:07.660" style="s2">there seen in this in the story and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.110" end="00:44:11.110" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a way of going about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.660" end="00:44:16.930" style="s2">like I think not good yeah I could</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.110" end="00:44:18.710" style="s2">actually fit quite nicely seems a bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.930" end="00:44:20.450" style="s2">like between the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.710" end="00:44:23.990" style="s2">you know content they&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.450" end="00:44:26.119" style="s2">lot of it is based around just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.990" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">emphasizing the final thing that gets</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.119" end="00:44:31.790" style="s2">built in sort of you know talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">the different options there is there any</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.790" end="00:44:35.900" style="s2">desire to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:38.030" style="s2">I guess build a library of ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.900" end="00:44:41.710" style="s2">sort of a community around the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.030" end="00:44:44.300" style="s2">individual components like hey I used</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.710" end="00:44:46.099" style="s2">beeswax and sticks if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.300" end="00:44:47.780" style="s2">something similar or you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.099" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">harder to get in your area crowd</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.780" end="00:44:51.859" style="s2">sourcing alternatives and having that as</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:53.420" style="s2">one of the things to talk about like</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.859" end="00:44:56.930" style="s2">what other things can use a joining</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.420" end="00:45:00.349" style="s2">material or structure or yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.930" end="00:45:02.930" style="s2">that&#39;s also another another factor of</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.349" end="00:45:04.849" style="s2">like I guess the the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.930" end="00:45:06.320" style="s2">community of practice and the community</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.849" end="00:45:08.060" style="s2">of modeling because it&#39;s the same with</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.320" end="00:45:10.670" style="s2">the with what I have with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.060" end="00:45:13.130" style="s2">large-scale structures when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.670" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">went to London is suddenly I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.130" end="00:45:17.810" style="s2">place where palm sticks are not lying</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:20.750" style="s2">around on the street everywhere and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.810" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">can&#39;t find branches so then I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.750" end="00:45:26.030" style="s2">to use the cardboard and adapt to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:29.990" style="s2">local context in order to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.030" end="00:45:33.490" style="s2">challenges so I think there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.990" end="00:45:36.830" style="s2">definitely some strong in-game</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.490" end="00:45:38.810" style="s2">opportunities there actually in in in</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.830" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">having these weekly time-based</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.810" end="00:45:48.200" style="s2">challenges having a community feedback</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:51.890" style="s2">system using the using the video and how</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.200" end="00:45:54.290" style="s2">did you produce yours where you are I I</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.890" end="00:45:56.990" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s actually got some</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.290" end="00:46:00.650" style="s2">really strong opportunities and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.990" end="00:46:04.849" style="s2">lot of what the what the game element is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.650" end="00:46:06.770" style="s2">is is about so the the individual game</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.849" end="00:46:09.530" style="s2">is called context craft so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.770" end="00:46:12.410" style="s2">about like responding and reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.530" end="00:46:16.310" style="s2">your to your context using what&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.410" end="00:46:19.339" style="s2">you and and building on that so I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.310" end="00:46:22.010" style="s2">that could actually be a very very</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.339" end="00:46:23.330" style="s2">strong idea yeah I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.010" end="00:46:26.660" style="s2">mention because it keeps coming up in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.330" end="00:46:29.330" style="s2">head there&#39;s a reddit stuff whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.660" end="00:46:32.360" style="s2">those things called subreddit called DIY</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.330" end="00:46:33.380" style="s2">I think that rules are quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.360" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">that you have to have like made it</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.380" end="00:46:35.870" style="s2">yourself it has to be an original</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.180" style="s2">project and yeah I think you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.870" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">even much give instructions on how to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.180" end="00:46:42.470" style="s2">make it yourself somewhere but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:45.560" style="s2">like a milly like there&#39;s a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.470" end="00:46:47.180" style="s2">people following it and so getting a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.560" end="00:46:48.950" style="s2">video of like having your YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.180" end="00:46:52.280" style="s2">channel it&#39;s hard to get subscribers on</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.950" end="00:46:53.720" style="s2">YouTube channel yet even on a subreddit</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.280" end="00:46:55.070" style="s2">like that where it&#39;s it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.720" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">automatic and then that&#39;s funneling</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.070" end="00:46:58.370" style="s2">through to the Facebook or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">have the actual community on right of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.370" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">people submitting videos and pictures</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:03.800" style="s2">because YouTube is not the best place</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:07.850" style="s2">for that it kind of actually filters out</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.800" end="00:47:10.550" style="s2">people submitting video and pictures so</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.850" end="00:47:13.070" style="s2">yeah like happy not all all feed feed</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.550" end="00:47:24.170" style="s2">together finding that the reddit&#39;s that</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.140" end="00:47:58.760" style="s2">identity all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:48:00.170" style="s2">my the rule I&#39;m starting and you may</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.760" end="00:48:02.270" style="s2">have found this also but the rule was</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.170" end="00:48:05.000" style="s2">trying to do with all my projects is</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.270" end="00:48:07.430" style="s2">keep them all under one in one place</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.000" end="00:48:08.900" style="s2">until they&#39;re so big that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.430" end="00:48:11.240" style="s2">pull them out because otherwise you just</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.900" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">spend all your time buying domain names</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.240" end="00:48:16.610" style="s2">about 60 and building websites that</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:20.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t crash and stuff like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.610" end="00:48:22.550" style="s2">very distracting so yeah you can if if</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.180" end="00:48:24.980" style="s2">your site kind of name and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.550" end="00:48:27.290" style="s2">name that you&#39;ve given is broad enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.980" end="00:48:29.330" style="s2">that everything should fit under that in</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.290" end="00:48:31.130" style="s2">some way or another because then does</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.330" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">they they are tied together by that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.130" end="00:48:35.330" style="s2">common goal and then you could always</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:37.070" style="s2">break them out later it&#39;s not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.330" end="00:48:41.840" style="s2">think it&#39;s that hard to break it out and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.070" end="00:48:44.630" style="s2">then you know having a marketplace and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.840" end="00:48:45.920" style="s2">library of how to build these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.630" end="00:48:49.430" style="s2">things and even to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.920" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">fools like you know maybe I want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.430" end="00:48:54.200" style="s2">build a geodesic dome and I could go</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:56.839" style="s2">there and pull up a plan for the size</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.200" end="00:48:59.390" style="s2">that I want and then plug in where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.839" end="00:49:01.790" style="s2">at and it would determine from content</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.390" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">created by other users in the area what</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.790" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">materials I could find in the local area</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:08.390" style="s2">what the cost of any of the parts that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:11.930" style="s2">have to buy or places I could get the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.390" end="00:49:14.900" style="s2">recycled materials I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.930" end="00:49:17.180" style="s2">an interesting tool and then have people</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.900" end="00:49:20.180" style="s2">be able to present designs and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.180" end="00:49:23.780" style="s2">contribute back and modify existing</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.180" end="00:49:28.220" style="s2">designs kind of like github if you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.780" end="00:49:32.750" style="s2">programming and then the ability to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.220" end="00:49:34.970" style="s2">know pay the designers for the work that</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.750" end="00:49:36.710" style="s2">they did and maybe even find other</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.970" end="00:49:38.690" style="s2">people in the community craftsmen and</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.710" end="00:49:41.900" style="s2">the community I&#39;d put it together for</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.690" end="00:49:43.549" style="s2">you if if you don&#39;t have the time to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.900" end="00:49:44.900" style="s2">that that would be a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.549" end="00:49:47.380" style="s2">kind of future State</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.900" end="00:49:50.059" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t even start on any of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.380" end="00:49:51.410" style="s2">until I would do that getting the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.059" end="00:49:53.510" style="s2">information out there start cataloging</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.410" end="00:49:57.980" style="s2">it and stuff but but that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.510" end="00:49:59.869" style="s2">interesting future one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.980" end="00:50:01.880" style="s2">things it&#39;s very community building that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.869" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">it was just coming up was you had talked</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.880" end="00:50:06.170" style="s2">about people being engineers and their</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:09.010" style="s2">parent you know their their families</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.170" end="00:50:12.530" style="s2">drawing them out to other more</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.010" end="00:50:14.599" style="s2">profitable careers and I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.530" end="00:50:16.520" style="s2">lot of ingenuity especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.599" end="00:50:18.770" style="s2">developing world where you can live off</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.520" end="00:50:22.250" style="s2">of $500 a month right really well pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.770" end="00:50:24.049" style="s2">well and finding a way to like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.250" end="00:50:26.390" style="s2">okay in your space right like if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.049" end="00:50:27.799" style="s2">have your needs met finding a way where</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.390" end="00:50:29.210" style="s2">when you bring in money like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.799" end="00:50:31.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a scholarship fund where people</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.210" end="00:50:34.309" style="s2">are picking the top engineers the top</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.579" end="00:50:37.819" style="s2">designers in you know one per country or</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.309" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">one end like actually paid for them to</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.819" end="00:50:41.630" style="s2">do this full-time right like hey family</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:43.640" style="s2">look what I&#39;m doing and I&#39;m getting paid</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.630" end="00:50:44.900" style="s2">to do it and getting that prestige and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.640" end="00:50:47.030" style="s2">it&#39;s bringing a global community</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.900" end="00:50:48.619" style="s2">together in a way that&#39;s showcasing them</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.030" end="00:50:49.640" style="s2">right and having a new person hey this</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.619" end="00:50:51.260" style="s2">is the thing we&#39;re making this week</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.640" end="00:50:52.849" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna show you how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.260" end="00:50:55.609" style="s2">month and we&#39;re gonna you know like</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.849" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">bringing that was just okay thing to add</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.609" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">on so they can work on yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.990" end="00:51:06.310" style="s2">what okay to build on what Bentley was</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.210" end="00:51:08.860" style="s2">saying I think I&#39;m like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.310" end="00:51:10.390" style="s2">earliest things that you could have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.860" end="00:51:12.490" style="s2">community sort of generate and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.390" end="00:51:14.680" style="s2">sell would just be the building</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.490" end="00:51:16.780" style="s2">materials if I live in an area that has</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.680" end="00:51:18.610" style="s2">a bunch of plastic pollution and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.780" end="00:51:20.680" style="s2">so inclined to make you know some</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.610" end="00:51:23.770" style="s2">structure or joining or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.680" end="00:51:25.990" style="s2">bits and pieces are having like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.770" end="00:51:27.460" style="s2">opposite of Amazon where it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.990" end="00:51:30.250" style="s2">people going out to their area saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.460" end="00:51:31.300" style="s2">hey anybody who lives with an X distance</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.250" end="00:51:33.220" style="s2">from me</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.300" end="00:51:36.070" style="s2">show me people who are you know are</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.220" end="00:51:37.420" style="s2">building these materials nearby because</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.070" end="00:51:38.830" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m not that interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.420" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">part of it I just want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.830" end="00:51:44.050" style="s2">build with my kids or even just collect</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">in right yeah so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.050" end="00:51:47.800" style="s2">instructions on YouTube and stuff how to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:49.750" style="s2">do it but if you don&#39;t wanted to do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.800" end="00:51:52.300" style="s2">I think that might be one of the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.750" end="00:51:54.190" style="s2">things because then that lets people at</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.300" end="00:51:56.560" style="s2">all stages from the learning how to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.190" end="00:51:59.230" style="s2">it and just try not to tinker the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.560" end="00:52:01.240" style="s2">who want to build full domes yeah don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.230" end="00:52:02.530" style="s2">forget to build the materials and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.240" end="00:52:03.400" style="s2">people who want to build kits could</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.530" end="00:52:05.560" style="s2">either do it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.400" end="00:52:07.450" style="s2">or just buy the pieces from there and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.560" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">sort of have your own almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.450" end="00:52:14.290" style="s2">supply chain in the system yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:16.109" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the that&#39;s a big big</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.290" end="00:52:22.630" style="s2">opportunity like once you get into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.109" end="00:52:25.810" style="s2">to the to the ecosystem is that people</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.630" end="00:52:29.619" style="s2">need like if people want to own the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.810" end="00:52:33.160" style="s2">thing then that creates a need or a</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.619" end="00:52:34.840" style="s2">market for the thing and then I&#39;m body</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.160" end="00:52:38.350" style="s2">else can okay I can take up the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.840" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">challenge to to produce it and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.350" end="00:52:43.090" style="s2">profit from the production of it or I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:45.869" style="s2">can go and source the materials from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.090" end="00:52:48.850" style="s2">from the sourcing of the materials and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.869" end="00:52:53.380" style="s2">allurements benefiting assists getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.850" end="00:52:56.950" style="s2">the trash extracted from it and and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.380" end="00:52:59.800" style="s2">so on and so forth it&#39;s I think it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.950" end="00:53:02.290" style="s2">some strong kind of only win kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.800" end="00:53:06.820" style="s2">infinite win opportunities within that</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.290" end="00:53:09.930" style="s2">within that space so it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.820" end="00:53:09.930" style="s2">interesting to see how it</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.190" end="00:53:15.829" style="s2">and we&#39;ve also got an app that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.009" end="00:53:20.059" style="s2">working on to to develop whereby</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.829" end="00:53:21.890" style="s2">actually it&#39;s easier to scan the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.059" end="00:53:24.229" style="s2">three-dimensional designs and understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.890" end="00:53:27.319" style="s2">how to produce them because this is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.229" end="00:53:28.969" style="s2">separate challenge that we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.319" end="00:53:33.950" style="s2">as you can see it&#39;s really hard actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.969" end="00:53:36.920" style="s2">to understand what this is a video even</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.950" end="00:53:39.579" style="s2">because some free geometry doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.920" end="00:53:42.920" style="s2">really translate over a to dinah</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.579" end="00:53:45.109" style="s2">two-dimensional space so we&#39;re also work</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.920" end="00:53:49.430" style="s2">on how to develop that in augmented</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.109" end="00:53:53.089" style="s2">reality and ultimately how people will</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.430" end="00:53:55.910" style="s2">be able to view in physical space what</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.089" end="00:53:58.700" style="s2">these objects would look like and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.910" end="00:54:00.920" style="s2">find out to produce exactly so to break</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.700" end="00:54:04.729" style="s2">down the number of parts number of bits</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.920" end="00:54:13.279" style="s2">and all of these different elements but</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.729" end="00:54:18.579" style="s2">this is a long long long game and plant</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.279" end="00:54:18.579" style="s2">small seeds and grow it step by step and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.700" end="00:54:25.759" style="s2">little by little</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.239" end="00:54:31.309" style="s2">Yui arrows over here it will yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.759" end="00:54:33.950" style="s2">do 3d modeling and web design so putting</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.309" end="00:54:35.239" style="s2">3d models on a on a web page that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.950" end="00:54:36.950" style="s2">can just kind of like spin without</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.239" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">having any plugins or anything or</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.950" end="00:54:41.989" style="s2">definitely doable these days because</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:44.059" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to visualize if you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.989" end="00:54:46.279" style="s2">of like drag it around a bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.059" end="00:54:47.960" style="s2">but yeah but I think you can also do it</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.279" end="00:54:50.420" style="s2">in video I mean once you kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.960" end="00:54:52.400" style="s2">used to recording yourself and just</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.420" end="00:54:54.349" style="s2">taking the camera and you know rotating</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.400" end="00:54:57.380" style="s2">it around so that they can get a feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.349" end="00:55:00.410" style="s2">for the 3d and then you know get two</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.380" end="00:55:02.509" style="s2">cameras and the stereoscopic ones know</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.410" end="00:55:04.789" style="s2">if they have it on their their phone</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.509" end="00:55:07.930" style="s2">they could or the you know the the 3d</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.789" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">that&#39;s really coming into coming into</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.930" end="00:55:14.390" style="s2">more common technologies and so that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:21.410" style="s2">be good yeah yeah I&#39;ll maybe need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.390" end="00:55:23.140" style="s2">design a 3d rotating table next us I</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.410" end="00:55:25.339" style="s2">just wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.140" end="00:55:27.650" style="s2">jae-won out of what we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.339" end="00:55:29.859" style="s2">about draws you in the most like what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.650" end="00:55:34.550" style="s2">it you want to spend your time doing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.859" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">if you could find a like perfect partner</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.550" end="00:55:36.859" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:38.270" style="s2">what skills would they have or what</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.859" end="00:55:44.950" style="s2">would they do that you don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.270" end="00:55:49.369" style="s2">or can&#39;t do good good question I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.950" end="00:55:51.290" style="s2">from from from my perspective and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.369" end="00:55:58.430" style="s2">little bit of a challenge given where</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.290" end="00:56:04.550" style="s2">I&#39;m where where I&#39;m located but my body</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.430" end="00:56:09.140" style="s2">that was taking the the the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.550" end="00:56:12.760" style="s2">I&#39;m generating and putting them in a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.140" end="00:56:17.570" style="s2">that people can relate to online</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.760" end="00:56:22.910" style="s2">organizing the organizing the content</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.570" end="00:56:28.119" style="s2">and making it accessible for people that</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.910" end="00:56:31.849" style="s2">that it&#39;s easy to have that digital</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.119" end="00:56:35.390" style="s2">translation and and documentation</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.849" end="00:56:40.940" style="s2">process and this is this is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.390" end="00:56:42.829" style="s2">the the hard part I guess for me and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.940" end="00:56:46.700" style="s2">think it&#39;s a hard part for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.829" end="00:56:50.210" style="s2">makers is the the actual documentation</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.700" end="00:56:54.140" style="s2">the actual putting getting the the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.210" end="00:56:58.970" style="s2">products nicely photographed put online</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.140" end="00:57:02.210" style="s2">step by step and and packaging it in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.970" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">way that&#39;s easy for for people to relate</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.210" end="00:57:13.300" style="s2">to and and replicate and I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:15.740" style="s2">that also is that the the act of</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.300" end="00:57:19.099" style="s2">replication actually requires to some</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.740" end="00:57:22.390" style="s2">degree a slightly different mindset to</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.099" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">the active to the active discovery and</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.390" end="00:57:26.990" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:29.780" style="s2">relationship you know it&#39;s the eyes that</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.990" end="00:57:34.599" style="s2">seeing from the other perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.780" end="00:57:37.539" style="s2">attempting to copy well often because</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.599" end="00:57:41.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to sound big-headed but I</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.539" end="00:57:44.309" style="s2">am quite materially literate and because</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.920" end="00:57:48.309" style="s2">of that sometimes I take for granted</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.309" end="00:57:51.239" style="s2">things that are very simple for me to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.309" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">but for people that don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.239" end="00:57:56.589" style="s2">experience yet are surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.160" end="00:57:59.259" style="s2">difficult and I&#39;ve often been surprised</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.589" end="00:58:02.920" style="s2">by basic stuff like handling a pair of</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.259" end="00:58:04.599" style="s2">scissors and that I expect people to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.920" end="00:58:08.049" style="s2">able to just kind of pick up a plastic</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.599" end="00:58:09.400" style="s2">bottle and cut it but actually often</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.049" end="00:58:12.970" style="s2">people struggle with even these</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.400" end="00:58:16.509" style="s2">rudimentary things and because they they</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.970" end="00:58:19.479" style="s2">they haven&#39;t had that that material</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.509" end="00:58:21.910" style="s2">experienced one quick suggestion on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.479" end="00:58:23.499" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing the YouTube videos maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.910" end="00:58:25.630" style="s2">you can invite someone who you know is</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.499" end="00:58:28.239" style="s2">very low</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.630" end="00:58:30.910" style="s2">literate on materials and you walk them</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.239" end="00:58:34.269" style="s2">through the project and then they get to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.910" end="00:58:36.039" style="s2">be the audience and the core asking the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.269" end="00:58:38.789" style="s2">questions the audience would ask it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.039" end="00:58:41.890" style="s2">very hard when you&#39;re learning to teach</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.789" end="00:58:48.390" style="s2">to think from the mind of someone who</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.890" end="00:58:52.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know the curse of knowledge yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.390" end="00:58:53.950" style="s2">we are coming up close to the hour so if</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.839" end="00:58:56.769" style="s2">you want to do any closing statements</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.950" end="00:58:58.900" style="s2">search closing J and then I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.769" end="00:59:01.900" style="s2">know from you how this process went and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.900" end="00:59:03.910" style="s2">any suggestions you have for us doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.900" end="00:59:07.989" style="s2">project raisings for you in the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.910" end="00:59:12.219" style="s2">or anybody else in the future okay that</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.989" end="00:59:15.749" style="s2">was really telling the the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.219" end="00:59:19.420" style="s2">actually to share what I&#39;m up to and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.749" end="00:59:24.369" style="s2">check my ability to UK which was my main</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.019" end="00:59:32.890" style="s2">and the the feedback I think has been</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.950" end="00:59:38.039" style="s2">really useful ideas come out of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.890" end="00:59:41.650" style="s2">especially like this kind of event led</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.039" end="00:59:46.479" style="s2">process I think that could actually be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.650" end="00:59:48.080" style="s2">really useful aspect of the the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.479" end="00:59:51.650" style="s2">around the game that I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.080" end="00:59:53.060" style="s2">to develop is especially addressing a</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.650" end="00:59:57.290" style="s2">challenge of how to get remote</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.060" end="01:00:00.110" style="s2">participation and I think that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.290" end="01:00:04.040" style="s2">that has been really useful going</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.110" end="01:00:10.850" style="s2">forward so I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.040" end="01:00:12.500" style="s2">so no I think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s been</p>
