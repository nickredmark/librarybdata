<p begin="00:00:57.930" end="00:01:02.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve been having conversations in half</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">an hour time slots where each</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.039" end="00:01:05.070" style="s2">participant takes five minutes to answer</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">the question that we&#39;ve generated</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.960" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">be like you&#39;d suggested about $10 a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.510" end="00:02:46.860" style="s2">month for members and that would give</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:58.110" style="s2">them access to the apps that are</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">capitalism all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:15.060" style="s2">maybe cuz I flipped over to another tab</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:37.500" style="s2">community for a non-profit you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.640" end="00:03:42.330" style="s2">the goal isn&#39;t profit the goal is kind</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:24.810" style="s2">normally she&#39;s not home on Fridays but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:26.440" style="s2">today she is my famous 27 he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.810" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">interrupt as often nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.440" end="00:04:33.310" style="s2">final welcome of that habit but yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:36.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.310" end="00:04:38.710" style="s2">sound like a like I have a decent</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.520" end="00:04:42.790" style="s2">understanding of so far which you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.710" end="00:04:44.950" style="s2">for for together tack yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.790" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a tech cooperative we own together</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.950" end="00:04:49.810" style="s2">run together hopefully as democratically</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:51.400" style="s2">and transparently as possible but that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.810" end="00:04:55.480" style="s2">can only be within alignment with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.400" end="00:04:58.090" style="s2">technology we currently have and we fix</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.480" end="00:05:00.820" style="s2">it as we go we figure out what&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.090" end="00:05:02.470" style="s2">as things break and fix it both the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.820" end="00:05:04.810" style="s2">technology itself which I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.470" end="00:05:07.960" style="s2">how to do but also just the interactions</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.810" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">and what projects work how the process</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.960" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">of creating it together works how</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:14.670" style="s2">running it together works we keep on</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:18.480" style="s2">looking for ways to make it better</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.670" end="00:05:22.120" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a great idea I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.480" end="00:05:25.890" style="s2">when I heard of game B which was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.120" end="00:05:30.610" style="s2">recent and I&#39;ve been working on other I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.890" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">guess I could say similar ideas some</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.610" end="00:05:35.620" style="s2">friends of mine were working on</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:39.160" style="s2">exponential life satisfaction just so</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.620" end="00:05:40.840" style="s2">figuring out ways that we as a group and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.160" end="00:05:44.110" style="s2">could gather people together that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.840" end="00:05:46.540" style="s2">be able to figure out ways to improve</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.110" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">our life and game B really seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.540" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">way to do that I did have a question on</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:58.420" style="s2">when you think about together tech I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:06:00.250" style="s2">curious to know what skills are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.420" end="00:06:02.140" style="s2">bringing to this because like you said</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.250" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">you can&#39;t develop the tech which is fine</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.140" end="00:06:09.130" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna need lots of people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:12.900" style="s2">aren&#39;t you know developers but where do</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.130" end="00:06:15.340" style="s2">you you&#39;ve went near it again</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.900" end="00:06:18.760" style="s2">well yeah where do we what do you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.340" end="00:06:22.600" style="s2">what what contributions are you willing</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.760" end="00:06:24.070" style="s2">and able to put towards this B so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.600" end="00:06:26.050" style="s2">is a weird question for me to answer</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.070" end="00:06:27.580" style="s2">only because I don&#39;t fit into any of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.050" end="00:06:28.540" style="s2">boxes that normally this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.580" end="00:06:30.640" style="s2">reasons you&#39;re like well why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.540" end="00:06:33.130" style="s2">get involved with holo chain like well I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.640" end="00:06:34.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know code I&#39;m not a tech person in</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.130" end="00:06:36.220" style="s2">fact tech makes you want to throw my</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:38.979" style="s2">computer through the window quite often</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.220" end="00:06:40.060" style="s2">I&#39;m not but I think those are the very</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.979" end="00:06:42.730" style="s2">people we need create</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.060" end="00:06:44.020" style="s2">Tec there was someone I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.730" end="00:06:46.120" style="s2">extinction rebellion who wanted everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.020" end="00:06:48.040" style="s2">to jump on this cord to discuss how we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.120" end="00:06:49.450" style="s2">how we create Tec for its nation</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.040" end="00:06:51.010" style="s2">rebellion I was like I hate discord</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.450" end="00:06:52.810" style="s2">they&#39;re like it&#39;s easy like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.010" end="00:06:55.480" style="s2">telling me it&#39;s easy you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.810" end="00:06:57.010" style="s2">listening it&#39;s like so therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.480" end="00:07:00.730" style="s2">need people at a certain level of tech</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.010" end="00:07:03.700" style="s2">to even discuss what we could create</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.700" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">ech</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.120" end="00:07:10.810" style="s2">what I bring to the table is me as does</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:13.000" style="s2">everybody my brain my experience seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.810" end="00:07:15.010" style="s2">to really like creating ideas for</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.000" end="00:07:18.040" style="s2">technology that help improve the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.010" end="00:07:19.810" style="s2">and help create game B that is basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.040" end="00:07:23.140" style="s2">what my brain has done by itself before</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.810" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">ever encountering game B is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.140" end="00:07:27.910" style="s2">I&#39;m online on YouTube on periscope on</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:29.590" style="s2">Twitter is in my bedroom by myself I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.910" end="00:07:32.320" style="s2">like I know how to dismantle capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.590" end="00:07:33.640" style="s2">with my whole pessimistic backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.320" end="00:07:35.830" style="s2">and everything I had learned up till</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.640" end="00:07:38.550" style="s2">that point I was like this is it like</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.830" end="00:07:41.260" style="s2">this is what could actually work and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.550" end="00:07:42.970" style="s2">there is no skill set right like there</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.260" end="00:07:44.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t there&#39;s no degree that says that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.970" end="00:07:48.490" style="s2">there&#39;s no like I do have a degree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.920" end="00:07:51.160" style="s2">in science but it&#39;s a micro amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.490" end="00:07:52.900" style="s2">what I know like what my experience is</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.160" end="00:07:54.280" style="s2">because I&#39;ve lived my life I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.900" end="00:07:58.650" style="s2">had brain tumors in a single mom and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.280" end="00:08:01.150" style="s2">like we&#39;re all a microcosm of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.650" end="00:08:03.640" style="s2">talents and challenges that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.150" end="00:08:05.620" style="s2">experience in life and that is what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.640" end="00:08:08.760" style="s2">world needs is a way to tap into each</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.620" end="00:08:11.230" style="s2">person like what what makes you happy</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.760" end="00:08:12.610" style="s2">because the happier you are the more you</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.230" end="00:08:13.960" style="s2">have to give the world even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.610" end="00:08:17.380" style="s2">never that you&#39;re giving in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.960" end="00:08:20.440" style="s2">technology company itself your release</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.380" end="00:08:22.120" style="s2">like what you&#39;re here to give humanity</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.440" end="00:08:25.150" style="s2">might be art it might be being an</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.120" end="00:08:27.100" style="s2">amazing parent or uncle or that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.150" end="00:08:29.140" style="s2">never really know someone&#39;s contribution</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.100" end="00:08:31.810" style="s2">right you can&#39;t monetize it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.140" end="00:08:33.460" style="s2">put I know that my contribution what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.810" end="00:08:35.920" style="s2">capable of doing is having a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.460" end="00:08:37.630" style="s2">conversation and attending a meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.920" end="00:08:39.910" style="s2">that&#39;s basically all I can do with my</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.630" end="00:08:42.940" style="s2">health challenges so unless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.910" end="00:08:44.530" style="s2">something easy for me to do like if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.940" end="00:08:45.730" style="s2">all take on tasks in someone&#39;s coding</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.530" end="00:08:47.410" style="s2">something I&#39;m never gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.730" end="00:08:48.460" style="s2">take that piece on but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.410" end="00:08:50.440" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what the board of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.460" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">directors does anyway if there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.440" end="00:08:55.910" style="s2">important directors that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">this is what I can do I can be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.910" end="00:08:59.690" style="s2">conversation and answer questions and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that looks like in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.690" end="00:09:04.970" style="s2">bigger meta project except that I do</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:06.680" style="s2">like if there was a lot a big piece of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.970" end="00:09:08.030" style="s2">my ego that was like how do I create a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.680" end="00:09:09.650" style="s2">technology company cuz exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.030" end="00:09:10.610" style="s2">question they&#39;re gonna kick me out I</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.650" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:15.410" style="s2">technology company and I don&#39;t care even</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:17.060" style="s2">if I did get kicked out I&#39;m like if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.410" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">started it I&#39;m okay with that but bigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.060" end="00:09:22.340" style="s2">than that any project like this that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:25.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have me on board is hurting</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.340" end="00:09:27.530" style="s2">because my brain creates solutions can</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.190" end="00:09:29.960" style="s2">think of problems and create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.530" end="00:09:32.090" style="s2">for the meta in a way it can&#39;t do for my</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.960" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">interpersonal life like I can create the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.090" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">idea of a food out how we all eat better</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:36.770" style="s2">but can&#39;t figure out how to like make a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.840" style="s2">recipe for my family because of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.770" end="00:09:44.090" style="s2">executive dysfunctioning skills so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.840" end="00:09:45.170" style="s2">can&#39;t figure out how to buy a car my car</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.090" end="00:09:46.430" style="s2">broke down I was literally in bed</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.170" end="00:09:49.730" style="s2">because when I go under stress my</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.430" end="00:09:51.080" style="s2">nervous system shuts down for days but</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.730" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">while I was there I was like figuring</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.080" end="00:09:56.030" style="s2">out the entire transportation system for</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">the world like it&#39;s like a weird process</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.030" end="00:10:00.260" style="s2">that my brain goes through and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">just going with it and enjoying being</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.260" end="00:10:05.720" style="s2">the one behind that it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">windshield so yeah what I&#39;m what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.720" end="00:10:13.910" style="s2">hearing is that is that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:19.780" style="s2">things you can contributor are like</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.910" end="00:10:23.780" style="s2">vision and you know problem-solving and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.780" end="00:10:27.890" style="s2">you know a perspective right on lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.780" end="00:10:31.730" style="s2">these tools that would be done which the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.890" end="00:10:33.740" style="s2">the perspective and like would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.730" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">something that would I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.740" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">we&#39;d say is expected from every member</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:41.870" style="s2">but would be optional which we can all</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:43.310" style="s2">kind of provide our perspectives but a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.870" end="00:10:46.700" style="s2">good diversity of perspective would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.310" end="00:10:48.590" style="s2">important and then I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.700" end="00:10:51.170" style="s2">would consider yourself because what</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.590" end="00:10:52.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve been doing with with YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.170" end="00:10:55.280" style="s2">stuff is that you have been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.700" end="00:10:57.410" style="s2">promoting and a little bit of community</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.280" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">building but I don&#39;t know if that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.410" end="00:11:01.730" style="s2">too rigid or you know something that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:03.890" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that you&#39;re just doing out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.730" end="00:11:06.590" style="s2">necessity or if that&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.890" end="00:11:08.870" style="s2">enjoy both it start</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.590" end="00:11:10.960" style="s2">necessity just like being on social</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.870" end="00:11:14.870" style="s2">media started out of necessity but I am</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.960" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">thoroughly enjoying it now good yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.870" end="00:11:19.790" style="s2">mean so that&#39;s some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:22.900" style="s2">that I think that you bring to this</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.790" end="00:11:25.400" style="s2">process that would be very beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.900" end="00:11:28.310" style="s2">and I just wonder I was just curious</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.400" end="00:11:30.380" style="s2">whether that was something how how</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.310" end="00:11:32.060" style="s2">painful is that because for some people</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.380" end="00:11:34.730" style="s2">they want to see something exist in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.060" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">world and for me a lot of the community</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.730" end="00:11:40.370" style="s2">building parts is very challenging and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:42.100" style="s2">I&#39;d much rather just be sitting writing</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.370" end="00:11:45.350" style="s2">code because I&#39;m one of the tech guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.100" end="00:11:47.240" style="s2">but you can write code all day and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.350" end="00:11:50.510" style="s2">you know if no one uses it it&#39;s a waste</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.240" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">of time yeah and that&#39;s basically I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.510" end="00:11:53.060" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to write code I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:55.790" style="s2">tried to learn and it does not work for</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.060" end="00:11:58.040" style="s2">my brain because it&#39;s a language but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.790" end="00:12:00.440" style="s2">have nuts basically what I&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.040" end="00:12:02.420" style="s2">sat and coded a way to dispense</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.440" end="00:12:03.650" style="s2">capitalism but it doesn&#39;t work unless I</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.420" end="00:12:06.080" style="s2">can get other people on board and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.650" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">explain it and so I basically sat in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.080" end="00:12:09.890" style="s2">room and decoded how did the immense</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:11.630" style="s2">amount of capitalism and now I let it go</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.890" end="00:12:13.520" style="s2">in the spring to a big degree I was like</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.630" end="00:12:15.470" style="s2">oh like I can&#39;t sell this if I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.520" end="00:12:18.040" style="s2">communicate it so I have to like let go</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.470" end="00:12:21.110" style="s2">of my vision recreate it with people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.040" end="00:12:24.080" style="s2">after encountering game B that is again</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.110" end="00:12:26.090" style="s2">the realization I came to is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.080" end="00:12:30.050" style="s2">although I have something amazing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.090" end="00:12:32.030" style="s2">offer also I get to let it go and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.050" end="00:12:33.560" style="s2">recreate it with other people because if</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.030" end="00:12:35.030" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like what you said if you code</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.560" end="00:12:37.250" style="s2">you no one&#39;s using it it&#39;s not it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.030" end="00:12:39.290" style="s2">I coded it but it&#39;s not useful unless</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.250" end="00:12:41.450" style="s2">there&#39;s an actual program to run it</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.290" end="00:12:42.890" style="s2">unless there&#39;s people who want to come</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.450" end="00:12:44.810" style="s2">and can see the vision of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.890" end="00:12:46.960" style="s2">technology gives us and want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.810" end="00:12:49.820" style="s2">co-create a technological cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.960" end="00:12:51.470" style="s2">yeah yeah so and I have a couple like</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.820" end="00:12:54.890" style="s2">small projects that I think could</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.470" end="00:12:56.750" style="s2">contribute but I&#39;ve listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.890" end="00:13:00.230" style="s2">talk I was thinking I really need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.750" end="00:13:03.080" style="s2">consider I have to be willing to throw</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.230" end="00:13:06.440" style="s2">much of it away and restart so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.080" end="00:13:09.670" style="s2">there&#39;s buy-ins important but also that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.440" end="00:13:11.660" style="s2">people can express what their needs are</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.670" end="00:13:14.150" style="s2">clearly so we can make sure the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.660" end="00:13:16.130" style="s2">technologies is fulfilling those needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.150" end="00:13:20.400" style="s2">rather than what I thought those needs</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.130" end="00:13:22.830" style="s2">were sitting in my office alone</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.400" end="00:13:27.270" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.830" end="00:13:29.820" style="s2">been thinking about so as far as like</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.270" end="00:13:31.800" style="s2">together tech right now what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.820" end="00:13:33.930" style="s2">is you&#39;re talking about it on this</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:42.630" style="s2">documents or a website or anything yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.020" end="00:13:44.190" style="s2">there is a website it&#39;s accessible</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.630" end="00:13:46.080" style="s2">through my Twitter account it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.190" end="00:13:47.730" style="s2">profile it&#39;s a Wix website there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.730" end="00:13:52.920" style="s2">wordpress so it will be together tech</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.010" end="00:13:55.470" style="s2">org and it&#39;ll be basically what the Wix</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.920" end="00:13:57.570" style="s2">website it was which is a basic rundown</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.470" end="00:14:00.630" style="s2">of what a tech cooperative can do and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.570" end="00:14:02.820" style="s2">then my blog posting for for a few</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.630" end="00:14:04.530" style="s2">months of I forced myself to do a blog</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.820" end="00:14:06.450" style="s2">post every week because that was my</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.530" end="00:14:09.060" style="s2">deadline I have to try to have something</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.170" end="00:14:22.440" style="s2">having fun but showcasing that process</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.220" end="00:14:24.750" style="s2">because I get that that is almost as</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.440" end="00:14:27.900" style="s2">integral as the idea of the tech company</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.750" end="00:14:30.780" style="s2">itself is the person I&#39;ve had to become</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.900" end="00:14:32.970" style="s2">to put it out in the world is like a</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.370" end="00:14:40.260" style="s2">communicate it so it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.620" end="00:14:41.670" style="s2">showcasing the process showcasing what</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.260" end="00:14:43.290" style="s2">I&#39;m doing as I&#39;m doing it so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.670" end="00:14:47.340" style="s2">someone else could maybe backtrack and</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.569" end="00:15:33.679" style="s2">a feeling for what the level of interest</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.309" end="00:15:37.819" style="s2">is so far our participation maybe then</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.679" end="00:15:39.889" style="s2">interest well there&#39;s a few issues of</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.029" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">on board I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.699" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">can deal with one person but once</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:51.649" style="s2">there&#39;s a third person I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:54.499" style="s2">to actually um I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.649" end="00:15:55.939" style="s2">actually create like um deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.499" end="00:15:57.230" style="s2">third person I&#39;m like okay well we set</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.939" end="00:15:58.970" style="s2">up a time period now I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.230" end="00:16:00.889" style="s2">like I can what&#39;s the word like</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.970" end="00:16:02.869" style="s2">negotiate talk through something with</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.889" end="00:16:04.999" style="s2">one person but two people and like I</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.869" end="00:16:06.499" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m figuring out how to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.999" end="00:16:07.699" style="s2">this process I&#39;ve been following which</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.499" end="00:16:09.980" style="s2">is following my own internal guidance</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.699" end="00:16:12.920" style="s2">and how to do that with somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.980" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">who&#39;s also doing that and and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.920" end="00:16:16.759" style="s2">then when our visions separate right how</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:18.949" style="s2">do we how do we figure that out and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.759" end="00:16:20.179" style="s2">that&#39;s part of me going back to that to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.949" end="00:16:22.339" style="s2">the drawing board I think I forgot the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.179" end="00:16:24.910" style="s2">question which was uh I was just saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.339" end="00:16:28.069" style="s2">about how many people you kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.910" end="00:16:30.579" style="s2">either already doing something or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.069" end="00:16:32.869" style="s2">just trying to get a feel for where</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.579" end="00:16:35.119" style="s2">where the idea is that right now is hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.869" end="00:16:39.439" style="s2">so participation from other people so</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.119" end="00:16:40.819" style="s2">far comment to you in there to comment</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.439" end="00:16:46.009" style="s2">to you on something that&#39;s not not</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.819" end="00:16:48.829" style="s2">useful so I believe and this is my</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.009" end="00:16:51.019" style="s2">hypothesis is if what we I&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.829" end="00:16:52.699" style="s2">what we are creating was presented in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.019" end="00:16:54.649" style="s2">way that wasn&#39;t me in my bedroom with</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.699" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">black in the backgrounds like was an</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.649" end="00:16:58.699" style="s2">actual video that was edited and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:16:59.989" style="s2">explained it professionally there would</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.699" end="00:17:01.429" style="s2">be a ton of people who wanted to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.989" end="00:17:02.749" style="s2">involved but I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.429" end="00:17:03.799" style="s2">looks like so I don&#39;t even want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.749" end="00:17:05.120" style="s2">pursue that because I&#39;m like unless</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.799" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">there&#39;s someone else you on board if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.120" end="00:17:08.389" style="s2">know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:12.589" style="s2">right now within my capacity what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.389" end="00:17:14.780" style="s2">looking for is basically having a board</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.589" end="00:17:18.020" style="s2">of directors median with</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.780" end="00:17:19.459" style="s2">other people on camera and talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.020" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">what is the step to actually start</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.459" end="00:17:23.089" style="s2">something right what is that and so it</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:26.270" style="s2">has to people who are willing to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.089" end="00:17:28.220" style="s2">through the process on camera because</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.270" end="00:17:29.810" style="s2">that is how we transparently show how</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.220" end="00:17:31.100" style="s2">we&#39;re creating a global tech cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.810" end="00:17:33.860" style="s2">so that anyone can come on board and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.100" end="00:17:37.400" style="s2">start becoming a member and my vision</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.860" end="00:17:38.780" style="s2">what I hypothesize is that if it gets</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.400" end="00:17:41.300" style="s2">like if there&#39;s four three of us having</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.780" end="00:17:44.060" style="s2">a conversation and hundreds of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.300" end="00:17:46.070" style="s2">watching if we need anything done</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.060" end="00:17:47.240" style="s2">there&#39;ll be enough people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.070" end="00:17:48.350" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s a little thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.240" end="00:17:49.730" style="s2">needs to get done right there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.350" end="00:17:53.150" style="s2">someone with that skill set someone who</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.730" end="00:17:54.860" style="s2">wants to do it and the third thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.150" end="00:17:56.150" style="s2">get a task done wants to do it oh is</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.860" end="00:17:58.280" style="s2">aware they&#39;re aware because I watching</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.150" end="00:17:59.000" style="s2">it so things will get there rather</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.280" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">easily</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.000" end="00:18:02.780" style="s2">I just keep finding the next iteration</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.430" style="s2">that&#39;s like okay that&#39;s something I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.780" end="00:18:07.790" style="s2">do within my capacity and what I can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.430" end="00:18:09.950" style="s2">is show up to a meeting and therefore if</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.790" end="00:18:12.050" style="s2">we&#39;re able to have meetings online on a</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:13.400" style="s2">video it can move forward with me to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.050" end="00:18:15.590" style="s2">meanness and everyone doing working</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.400" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">within their capacity doing what is fun</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.590" end="00:18:20.330" style="s2">and easy for the individual but</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:21.830" style="s2">collectively we move it forward even</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.330" end="00:18:29.210" style="s2">though collectively right now is just me</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.830" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">myself yeah so far yeah so you would so</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.210" end="00:18:35.660" style="s2">it seems like you&#39;re thinking that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">next step would be to get some people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.660" end="00:18:41.000" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s you do you think the next</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:42.350" style="s2">step is to go of to people like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.000" end="00:18:45.710" style="s2">right now it&#39;s you and me but to go to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.350" end="00:18:48.860" style="s2">three and then do you me it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.710" end="00:18:52.370" style="s2">you need help with scheduling that and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.860" end="00:18:55.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you want a format for that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.370" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">or if you already have a form I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.610" end="00:19:00.470" style="s2">particularly have a format for it as far</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:04.100" style="s2">as just getting together and having like</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.470" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">you know what was what did we say we</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.100" end="00:19:05.990" style="s2">were gonna do last week to move it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:09.710" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.990" end="00:19:11.060" style="s2">and what needs to get done if if what</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.710" end="00:19:12.800" style="s2">needs to get done is not something</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.060" end="00:19:14.450" style="s2">anyone wants to take on or can take on</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.800" end="00:19:15.860" style="s2">that it kind of needs to be put on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.450" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">shelf until there is somebody who can</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.860" end="00:19:18.440" style="s2">take that on right like we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:19.940" style="s2">at the legality of something and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.440" end="00:19:22.220" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lawyer and we can&#39;t fund a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.940" end="00:19:23.210" style="s2">lawyer if we don&#39;t have funding then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.220" end="00:19:24.679" style="s2">know like okay well that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.210" end="00:19:26.810" style="s2">that needs to get done I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.679" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">what&#39;s I know there&#39;s software out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.810" end="00:19:31.850" style="s2">to do that way if they all call</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:33.770" style="s2">moaning and they all or I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.850" end="00:19:36.250" style="s2">about them but other people know how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.770" end="00:19:38.750" style="s2">use like Google Docs and do things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.250" end="00:19:40.190" style="s2">facilitate that and that&#39;s not quite my</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.750" end="00:19:42.890" style="s2">strong point but I know there are people</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.190" end="00:19:44.540" style="s2">out there who can who will know how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.890" end="00:19:46.550" style="s2">do it I just know the more brains are in</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.540" end="00:19:47.990" style="s2">the room the more people are in the room</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.550" end="00:19:49.460" style="s2">the more that solutions can be found</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.990" end="00:19:50.450" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re looking for them</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.460" end="00:19:51.650" style="s2">but you&#39;re not looking to have a debate</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.450" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.650" end="00:19:55.880" style="s2">problem solve this and we&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:57.470" style="s2">have conflict and have to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.880" end="00:20:00.170" style="s2">as well and that&#39;s part of showcasing</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.470" end="00:20:02.600" style="s2">what it is I mean entrepreneurs don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.170" end="00:20:04.550" style="s2">this on camera right they do it behind</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.600" end="00:20:07.070" style="s2">closed doors and then present a polished</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.550" end="00:20:09.110" style="s2">package I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we do</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.070" end="00:20:10.730" style="s2">I think we showcase the problem so that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.110" end="00:20:15.500" style="s2">all the members can see because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.730" end="00:20:17.180" style="s2">just as integral to the process so if</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.500" end="00:20:18.380" style="s2">the board of directors can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.180" end="00:20:21.530" style="s2">how to fund it if the Board of Directors</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.380" end="00:20:22.820" style="s2">run short of money they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.530" end="00:20:24.800" style="s2">the board of directors like a normal</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.820" end="00:20:26.060" style="s2">company the rest of the people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.800" end="00:20:27.530" style="s2">really yell at them because right we</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.060" end="00:20:29.150" style="s2">showed you the financials you could have</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.530" end="00:20:31.190" style="s2">also said that we should have spent</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.150" end="00:20:33.590" style="s2">money here we spent too few here could</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.190" end="00:20:35.240" style="s2">have gotten more members right so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.590" end="00:20:38.060" style="s2">idea is just that the Board of Directors</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.240" end="00:20:39.770" style="s2">if a smaller group has to be empowered</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.060" end="00:20:42.080" style="s2">than we&#39;re empowering a smaller group</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.770" end="00:20:43.460" style="s2">right now we&#39;re starting with me and if</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.080" end="00:20:46.340" style="s2">you want to join you know a B and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.460" end="00:20:47.870" style="s2">we would find a time and facilitate we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.340" end="00:20:52.250" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily need suit on camera</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.870" end="00:20:54.980" style="s2">but co-create what the on camera meeting</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.250" end="00:20:56.990" style="s2">looks like right every week and and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.980" end="00:20:58.700" style="s2">meet at that time until a third person</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.990" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">wants to join and if they wanted to join</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.700" end="00:21:03.170" style="s2">but they couldn&#39;t meet that time then we</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:05.090" style="s2">might be able to facilitate a time</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.170" end="00:21:06.290" style="s2">between the three of us but once a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.090" end="00:21:07.970" style="s2">fourth person comes on board were not</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.290" end="00:21:10.610" style="s2">changing the time right it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:11.960" style="s2">the same hour every week because when</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.610" end="00:21:13.790" style="s2">you get to ten people one of the chances</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.960" end="00:21:16.790" style="s2">you&#39;re able to find I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.790" end="00:21:20.530" style="s2">were in game B when I tried the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.790" end="00:21:24.860" style="s2">cafe experiment with the like six hour I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.530" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">came in just after it and I did I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.860" end="00:21:28.820" style="s2">experienced the issue that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:31.550" style="s2">eventually found out is that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.820" end="00:21:36.590" style="s2">you leave it on all the time no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.550" end="00:21:40.090" style="s2">there at the same time so yeah so I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.590" end="00:21:40.090" style="s2">missed that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.690" end="00:21:44.779" style="s2">yeah you mean the cafe in general</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.879" end="00:21:46.610" style="s2">because there was the county they</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.779" end="00:21:48.590" style="s2">started it was 24 hours and it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.610" end="00:21:50.029" style="s2">amazing but then yeah you&#39;d start just</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.590" end="00:21:51.620" style="s2">it&#39;s served to Peter off because you get</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.029" end="00:21:52.759" style="s2">in and you&#39;d have to wait a long time</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.620" end="00:21:54.679" style="s2">for someone else to pop in so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.759" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">weren&#39;t having the conversations so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.679" end="00:21:58.100" style="s2">came up with this idea that I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:21:59.690" style="s2">came up before the extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.100" end="00:22:01.309" style="s2">I was like if there&#39;s enough people and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.690" end="00:22:02.450" style="s2">you have a way to facilitate it or you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.309" end="00:22:04.220" style="s2">all don&#39;t have to be at the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.450" end="00:22:07.159" style="s2">conversation then you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:08.899" style="s2">conversation every four hours so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.159" end="00:22:10.129" style="s2">six different time slots within a 24</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.899" end="00:22:12.610" style="s2">hour period and like the question</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.129" end="00:22:15.529" style="s2">changes every day or every two days and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:17.539" style="s2">which is what the idea Cafe is based</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.529" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">around the World Cafe which is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.539" end="00:22:21.350" style="s2">in-person way of having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:23.389" style="s2">they don&#39;t take five minutes to talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.350" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">each necessarily but you that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.389" end="00:22:26.690" style="s2">they&#39;d sure they have the 20 minute time</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.250" end="00:22:28.580" style="s2">slot to have a conversation with four</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.690" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">people and then they switch tables and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.580" end="00:22:32.210" style="s2">they have it with a new four people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:34.519" style="s2">a new four people and so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.210" end="00:22:36.440" style="s2">trying to do that with game B but there</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.519" end="00:22:39.019" style="s2">weren&#39;t enough people to facilitate it</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.440" end="00:22:40.730" style="s2">so the idea is not just that you come to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.019" end="00:22:42.259" style="s2">one conversation but you come to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.730" end="00:22:44.779" style="s2">multiple conversations so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.259" end="00:22:46.820" style="s2">bigger conversation going on and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.779" end="00:22:48.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen because there&#39;s only you</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.820" end="00:22:50.539" style="s2">know a few hundred people in the game B</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.470" end="00:22:52.100" style="s2">space and only a handful of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.539" end="00:22:55.460" style="s2">participating in them in the Xoom</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.100" end="00:22:56.450" style="s2">conversation but it&#39;s possible if we got</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.460" end="00:22:58.970" style="s2">big enough to be able to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.450" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">something like that where everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.970" end="00:23:01.070" style="s2">be part of the conversation it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:03.710" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.070" end="00:23:07.909" style="s2">yeah and and really I guess when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.710" end="00:23:10.399" style="s2">have you know two to four people you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.909" end="00:23:11.480" style="s2">just it&#39;s just one session and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.399" end="00:23:13.009" style="s2">move around because you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.480" end="00:23:18.350" style="s2">enough people but that there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.009" end="00:23:22.879" style="s2">value in that right I here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.350" end="00:23:27.730" style="s2">would like how I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.879" end="00:23:31.009" style="s2">participate I I don&#39;t have a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.730" end="00:23:32.899" style="s2">a lot of family things and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.009" end="00:23:36.019" style="s2">that but I think I can carve out you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.899" end="00:23:37.730" style="s2">know an hour a week to talk to this and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.019" end="00:23:44.090" style="s2">as long as you think that I&#39;m providing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.730" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">value I would like to to do that so how</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.090" end="00:23:49.370" style="s2">do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:50.840" style="s2">I mean it I think we 100% on board for</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.370" end="00:23:52.550" style="s2">that I think with anyone that comes on</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.840" end="00:23:54.680" style="s2">board I mean if actually game B I know</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.550" end="00:23:56.930" style="s2">that we have a lot of alignments and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.680" end="00:24:00.140" style="s2">values of what we want to create in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.930" end="00:24:01.430" style="s2">world I also think that like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.140" end="00:24:04.100" style="s2">we do this for a few weeks and we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.430" end="00:24:06.140" style="s2">like a posey-like we just we can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.100" end="00:24:07.250" style="s2">together great then we don&#39;t work to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.140" end="00:24:08.900" style="s2">or Namie like them we don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.250" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">together or we figure out that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.900" end="00:24:13.400" style="s2">it makes us stronger like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">figuring it out as we go it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.400" end="00:24:20.750" style="s2">the process and yeah I&#39;m a board for</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">that okay so maybe we could just if this</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.750" end="00:24:25.220" style="s2">times already set aside in you&#39;re okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:26.810" style="s2">using that time for that then I can put</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.220" end="00:24:31.390" style="s2">it permanently on my schedule and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.810" end="00:24:33.560" style="s2">could see how it goes yeah sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.390" end="00:24:35.270" style="s2">and how long do you normally do these</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.560" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">for you do for about an hour or 30</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.270" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">minutes I have been doing them for 30</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:40.190" style="s2">minutes just because there haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">people asking questions so I just come</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.580" end="00:25:24.770" style="s2">brain likes to answer questions did that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:25.910" style="s2">make sense that we I&#39;m okay doing it</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.770" end="00:25:27.080" style="s2">here in fact I&#39;d say we should probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.910" end="00:25:29.960" style="s2">start doing it here until there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.080" end="00:25:32.120" style="s2">people on board and then yeah make sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.960" end="00:25:33.860" style="s2">it works and we have some momentum going</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.120" end="00:25:36.590" style="s2">and then figure out</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.860" end="00:25:38.620" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve I&#39;m often the person that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.590" end="00:25:41.840" style="s2">have an idea and I built a whole website</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.620" end="00:25:42.440" style="s2">and then of course I you know I don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:46.190" style="s2">anything with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.440" end="00:25:51.490" style="s2">so I&#39;m learning to do smaller iterations</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.190" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">and proof points yeah there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.490" end="00:25:55.640" style="s2">projects because the idea cafe the idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:57.090" style="s2">behind the idea cafe is we need a way to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.640" end="00:25:59.519" style="s2">have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.090" end="00:26:01.080" style="s2">a lot of humanity so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.519" end="00:26:02.580" style="s2">understand what they need and understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.080" end="00:26:04.769" style="s2">where they are and also just connect</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.580" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">people I think that just having a way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.769" end="00:26:08.879" style="s2">really connect on social media solves a</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:10.440" style="s2">lot of our problems of like yelling</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.879" end="00:26:12.870" style="s2">across each other over akhrot chambers</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.440" end="00:26:14.519" style="s2">and trolling and I&#39;ve yet to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.870" end="00:26:17.429" style="s2">meet someone who&#39;s on camera who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.519" end="00:26:19.769" style="s2">willing to be an ass yeah like you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.429" end="00:26:22.049" style="s2">our personalities might conflict but</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.769" end="00:26:24.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same people still want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.049" end="00:26:25.999" style="s2">watch what they say but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.330" end="00:26:28.049" style="s2">whole other level that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.999" end="00:26:29.759" style="s2">for-profit social media is never going</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.049" end="00:26:31.590" style="s2">to tap into because that&#39;s not where the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.759" end="00:26:33.929" style="s2">money is or I there could be money there</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.590" end="00:26:36.600" style="s2">but they that&#39;s not what they started</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.929" end="00:26:38.789" style="s2">doing so they like conflict pays right</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.600" end="00:26:41.220" style="s2">putting a personification of your life</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.789" end="00:26:42.779" style="s2">on Instagram that isn&#39;t real pays them</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.220" end="00:26:45.539" style="s2">in a way that being real and authentic</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.779" end="00:26:49.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t right but there are other</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.539" end="00:26:51.960" style="s2">projects that aren&#39;t the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.190" end="00:26:53.700" style="s2">mainly the labor platform which gives us</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.960" end="00:26:54.929" style="s2">a lot of money to deal with everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.700" end="00:26:57.299" style="s2">else so maybe we don&#39;t even need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.929" end="00:26:59.429" style="s2">charge $10 a month and it helps</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.299" end="00:27:03.029" style="s2">dismantle the minimum wage and do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.429" end="00:27:04.710" style="s2">of it does a lot creating a labor</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.029" end="00:27:05.879" style="s2">platform it&#39;s like uber and TaskRabbit</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.710" end="00:27:09.119" style="s2">and all the things that people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.879" end="00:27:11.369" style="s2">already doing in a way for a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.119" end="00:27:13.019" style="s2">company right the sharing economy that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.369" end="00:27:15.210" style="s2">isn&#39;t really the sharing economy in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.019" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">for-profit company something like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.210" end="00:27:18.809" style="s2">that is cooperative where all of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:20.999" style="s2">everyone who is an employee is part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.809" end="00:27:22.379" style="s2">the cooperative and so are the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.999" end="00:27:23.970" style="s2">who are hiring them and figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.379" end="00:27:26.009" style="s2">to get health insurance figured that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.970" end="00:27:29.070" style="s2">big project though also like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.009" end="00:27:30.179" style="s2">a simple one the third one that I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.070" end="00:27:31.470" style="s2">just kind of coming up with last week</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.179" end="00:27:33.029" style="s2">which might be something that would more</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.470" end="00:27:34.409" style="s2">appeal to you based on what you just</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.029" end="00:27:37.980" style="s2">said about building websites that then</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.409" end="00:27:39.990" style="s2">don&#39;t go anywhere is a Yelp for websites</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.980" end="00:27:42.600" style="s2">there are so many projects out there</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.990" end="00:27:44.369" style="s2">that are amazing but they go away</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.600" end="00:27:46.529" style="s2">because nobody there isn&#39;t the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.369" end="00:27:48.210" style="s2">of people so what I would love to do is</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.529" end="00:27:50.279" style="s2">find this kind of what I was working in</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.210" end="00:27:51.749" style="s2">the last few days is possibly just</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.279" end="00:27:53.519" style="s2">interviewing people on here is getting</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.749" end="00:27:55.259" style="s2">some of those people who have projects</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.519" end="00:27:56.490" style="s2">either on the go or have had projects in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.259" end="00:27:59.100" style="s2">the past whether they&#39;ve been successful</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.490" end="00:28:01.049" style="s2">or a failure a learning projects</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.100" end="00:28:02.460" style="s2">something they learned from yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.049" end="00:28:04.980" style="s2">saying like what was the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.460" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">obstacle I believe it&#39;s that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.980" end="00:28:08.990" style="s2">weren&#39;t there right they didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.680" style="s2">funding right I didn&#39;t have and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.990" end="00:28:14.400" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.680" end="00:28:17.250" style="s2">a Yelp for websites one that we the user</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.400" end="00:28:18.330" style="s2">trusts like if we can build trust into</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.250" end="00:28:20.460" style="s2">it because we&#39;re creating it together</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.330" end="00:28:22.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a cooperative we&#39;re putting very</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.460" end="00:28:24.150" style="s2">transparently what that process is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.110" end="00:28:27.960" style="s2">say whether a project is good or bad and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.150" end="00:28:29.490" style="s2">also having it be because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.960" end="00:28:31.260" style="s2">cooperative the people can keep adding</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.490" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">features to it right like I care about</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.260" end="00:28:36.840" style="s2">the accessibility of an app game B might</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:38.970" style="s2">care about how game B the app is right</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.840" end="00:28:42.120" style="s2">is this a game be app or is this a game</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.970" end="00:28:43.530" style="s2">a up even if it&#39;s owned privately the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.120" end="00:28:44.610" style="s2">idea isn&#39;t that these are just our</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.530" end="00:28:46.410" style="s2">cooperative ones</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.610" end="00:28:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;s that anyone who has one Google</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.410" end="00:28:50.070" style="s2">anyone but mainly the little mom-and-pop</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.450" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">ones who start something and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.070" end="00:28:54.750" style="s2">amazing but nobody comes on board so it</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:57.540" style="s2">goes away having it be in a way if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.780" end="00:29:04.230" style="s2">Wikipedia for politicians right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.310" end="00:29:05.610" style="s2">which I know a ton of people would want</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.230" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t know how to market it</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.610" end="00:29:09.240" style="s2">enough to get people on board it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:11.370" style="s2">right that&#39;s the problem with every</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.169" end="00:30:39.059" style="s2">and half of them are out of business and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:41.669" style="s2">so I think that is a fairly easy</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.059" end="00:30:43.499" style="s2">application it like as far as to cut</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.669" end="00:30:46.529" style="s2">like the technology per unit creating a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.499" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">new Yelp isn&#39;t rocket science mr.</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.529" end="00:30:51.330" style="s2">vibrating but it&#39;s not it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:52.679" style="s2">people who already have tech projects on</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.330" end="00:30:55.139" style="s2">board getting enough of them on board</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.679" end="00:30:56.669" style="s2">that they want to have just to say right</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.139" end="00:30:58.409" style="s2">and like oh yeah this is how this would</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.669" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">have helped me in my project right</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.409" end="00:31:03.359" style="s2">having these features and benefits and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:06.419" style="s2">then a ton of people who use apps ie</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.359" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">everybody saying what do you care about</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.419" end="00:31:10.859" style="s2">what do you trust what don&#39;t you trust</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:12.979" style="s2">I&#39;m doing great something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.859" end="00:31:16.409" style="s2">and that also sounds like kind of a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.979" end="00:31:21.330" style="s2">initial iteration of together tech</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.409" end="00:31:23.330" style="s2">because it&#39;s also marketing tools could</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.330" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">pry the wrong term but you know a way to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.330" end="00:31:28.859" style="s2">to get it out there to get some sharing</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:32.220" style="s2">and for people to be aware of it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.859" end="00:31:34.169" style="s2">then those other apps so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.220" end="00:31:36.149" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.169" end="00:31:37.590" style="s2">ya know it starts because it&#39;s also it</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.149" end="00:31:40.710" style="s2">shows us holes in the marketplace to</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.590" end="00:31:42.029" style="s2">create our next ones it helps us find it</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.710" end="00:31:44.070" style="s2">the ones that like one at you if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.029" end="00:31:46.229" style="s2">watched the Netflix of apps that we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.070" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">license them right the runs that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.229" end="00:31:48.899" style="s2">like yeah if you bring me a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:50.609" style="s2">thousand people I can license it for a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.899" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">dollar per month and if there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.609" end="00:31:54.059" style="s2">of those that can work together right</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.460" style="s2">having it so that we&#39;re we&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.059" end="00:31:58.649" style="s2">them that&#39;s Omni win it&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.460" end="00:32:00.629" style="s2">and it&#39;s not you know like we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.649" end="00:32:01.859" style="s2">help you milk our customers for all</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.629" end="00:32:03.210" style="s2">they&#39;re worth because the point isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.859" end="00:32:06.599" style="s2">the point is the opposite of that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.210" end="00:32:08.429" style="s2">like how do we get the individual human</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.599" end="00:32:10.979" style="s2">projects that are gonna help improve</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.429" end="00:32:12.239" style="s2">their lives beyond marketing right mark</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.979" end="00:32:14.129" style="s2">me it&#39;s kind of like a lion to you to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.239" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">convince you were the best this is like</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.129" end="00:32:17.549" style="s2">are you actually the best will you put</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:19.139" style="s2">your money where your mouth is because</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.549" end="00:32:21.320" style="s2">my guess is the apps are gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.139" end="00:32:23.849" style="s2">pay for the process of getting rated</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.320" end="00:32:25.320" style="s2">properly and that&#39;s where the money</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.849" end="00:32:26.970" style="s2">comes from but it&#39;s transparent so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.320" end="00:32:28.259" style="s2">like $1000 to get your operate it I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.970" end="00:32:29.700" style="s2">don&#39;t know we would discuss all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.259" end="00:32:31.710" style="s2">funding sources but if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.700" end="00:32:33.869" style="s2">it isn&#39;t you give us a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.710" end="00:32:35.609" style="s2">we give you a five star rating it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.869" end="00:32:38.009" style="s2">go through the process of us rating and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.609" end="00:32:38.350" style="s2">if you&#39;re a for-profit company and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.009" end="00:32:40.299" style="s2">tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.350" end="00:32:42.309" style="s2">people what it is right so we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.299" end="00:32:44.230" style="s2">enough people going through the process</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.309" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">and rating it and saying what works and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.230" end="00:32:47.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and in a way that you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:48.660" style="s2">then even make it better right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.260" end="00:32:50.620" style="s2">the beauty of apps they&#39;re not movies</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.660" end="00:32:52.780" style="s2">they&#39;re not released and then they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.620" end="00:32:56.950" style="s2">what they are they can be made evolve</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.780" end="00:33:00.400" style="s2">yeah yeah the most of the app developers</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.950" end="00:33:04.210" style="s2">I know several of it well most of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.400" end="00:33:06.520" style="s2">are nonprofits mm-hmm so we&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.210" end="00:33:08.350" style="s2">figure that which is huge I mean those</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.520" end="00:33:10.030" style="s2">people being part of the iteration for</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.350" end="00:33:12.610" style="s2">talking about how we get people and born</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.030" end="00:33:14.169" style="s2">to them that&#39;s amazing right because</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.610" end="00:33:16.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve got those are the exact ones we</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.169" end="00:33:17.620" style="s2">want to succeed they might not be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.090" end="00:33:20.830" style="s2">ones to pay a thousand dollars to get it</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.620" end="00:33:22.390" style="s2">to get it right in right and so there</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.830" end="00:33:24.220" style="s2">can absolutely be different funding</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.390" end="00:33:26.530" style="s2">sources for like you&#39;re a for-profit app</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.220" end="00:33:28.390" style="s2">it&#39;s charging $10 a month we want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.530" end="00:33:30.700" style="s2">know if you&#39;re worth $10 a month versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.390" end="00:33:32.169" style="s2">a not-for-profit here&#39;s how you recycle</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.700" end="00:33:34.780" style="s2">your stuff that is never making money</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.169" end="00:33:37.299" style="s2">anyway we want to get people to you how</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.780" end="00:33:39.640" style="s2">do we facilitate that for you right that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.299" end="00:33:46.059" style="s2">is beyond necessarily wanting to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.640" end="00:33:48.789" style="s2">money off of them yeah yeah my gut is I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.059" end="00:33:52.780" style="s2">or at least I don&#39;t see yet how the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.789" end="00:33:54.400" style="s2">model there&#39;s a lot of challenges with</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.780" end="00:33:58.840" style="s2">the model of charging a thousand a month</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.400" end="00:34:07.539" style="s2">but I don&#39;t have enough money right</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.840" end="00:34:08.950" style="s2">number one time review well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.539" end="00:34:09.369" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying it I know that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.950" end="00:34:14.710" style="s2">won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.369" end="00:34:16.330" style="s2">but they I don&#39;t envision how that works</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.710" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">but I don&#39;t have any other funding</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.330" end="00:34:25.210" style="s2">practices in mind that would work so</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:26.590" style="s2">that would be the one to pursue I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.210" end="00:34:27.879" style="s2">know what they are but enough people if</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.590" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">there&#39;s five of us I guarantee we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.879" end="00:34:32.740" style="s2">come under the weighted transparent</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.149" style="s2">about that like listen we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.740" end="00:34:35.470" style="s2">through a period of having advertising</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.149" end="00:34:38.409" style="s2">until we get to its end dollar a month</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.470" end="00:34:41.649" style="s2">fee the words worth it we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.409" end="00:34:43.690" style="s2">this this portion of it and but I agree</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.649" end="00:34:44.980" style="s2">that I first of all more nobody we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.690" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">have the trust and we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.980" end="00:34:49.690" style="s2">people starting $1,000 a month</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:51.480" style="s2">breaks us before we start but if we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.690" end="00:34:53.780" style="s2">a million people and we&#39;re like listen</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.480" end="00:34:56.129" style="s2">a million customers potentially oru</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.780" end="00:34:58.080" style="s2">that&#39;s when it starts being worth money</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.129" end="00:34:59.850" style="s2">to them to be like okay if we get</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.080" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">assessed this is what we&#39;re getting for</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.850" end="00:35:03.869" style="s2">it right we get instant marketing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:05.730" style="s2">real marketing it&#39;s like these people</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.869" end="00:35:07.890" style="s2">want to be on board we&#39;re solving a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.730" end="00:35:09.570" style="s2">problem for them and they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.890" end="00:35:12.600" style="s2">here and because we&#39;ve created into it</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.570" end="00:35:14.940" style="s2">like the longevity of an app I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.600" end="00:35:16.109" style="s2">it hurts everyone like when the fact</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.940" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">that what I just said you go to a blog</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.109" end="00:35:20.910" style="s2">post and nine out of ten of them are</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:23.190" style="s2">gone you&#39;re like okay well if I&#39;m buying</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.910" end="00:35:24.420" style="s2">a lifetime subscription what does that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.190" end="00:35:26.430" style="s2">mean if you&#39;re gonna be gone in three</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.420" end="00:35:28.410" style="s2">months if I&#39;m giving you my children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.430" end="00:35:30.359" style="s2">picture so you can make photo albums or</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.410" end="00:35:32.040" style="s2">something but I want to have access to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.359" end="00:35:34.830" style="s2">them in ten years I can&#39;t trust you to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.040" end="00:35:36.980" style="s2">be here in ten years and the more apps</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.830" end="00:35:39.600" style="s2">come in and go out of business that fast</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.980" end="00:35:41.340" style="s2">the worse the next one has it and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.600" end="00:35:43.170" style="s2">next one has it and the more we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.340" end="00:35:46.200" style="s2">of build longevity into the model for</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.170" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">everybody if it&#39;s a good product I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.200" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">that that helps them and also us the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:55.980" style="s2">user yeah a lot of businesses because</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:58.830" style="s2">they were venture funded they eventually</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.980" end="00:36:01.130" style="s2">had to shut down not that they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.830" end="00:36:05.430" style="s2">profitable they just weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.130" end="00:36:09.869" style="s2">exponentially profitable so yes so</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.430" end="00:36:12.180" style="s2">pulling that requirement out would</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.869" end="00:36:15.990" style="s2">increase the longevity of those apps</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.180" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">quite a bit especially so I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.990" end="00:36:21.560" style="s2">thinking of also wondering whether there</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:25.710" style="s2">might be people that would be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.560" end="00:36:29.430" style="s2">quote donate ten dollars a month to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.710" end="00:36:34.619" style="s2">this in existence and go ahead and start</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.540" end="00:36:51.480" style="s2">know some nominal pays it&#39;s no wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.220" end="00:36:56.100" style="s2">be enough to be considered pay but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.480" end="00:36:57.570" style="s2">yeah to do reviews and to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.100" end="00:37:00.890" style="s2">stuff like that and and tell me get</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.570" end="00:37:04.130" style="s2">enough funding towards self-supportive I</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.890" end="00:37:06.680" style="s2">think with apps in particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.130" end="00:37:07.880" style="s2">mhm payments especially if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.680" end="00:37:09.410" style="s2">someone like me who doesn&#39;t use tech</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.880" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">right I&#39;m not gonna know the code I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.410" end="00:37:13.190" style="s2">not gonna know that piece the payment is</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:14.570" style="s2">the free app and I think about a YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.190" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">star who gets all this stuff given to</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.570" end="00:37:17.930" style="s2">them and then they&#39;re a sponsor for it</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:19.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like the payments is you get to try</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.930" end="00:37:21.020" style="s2">this you get to try all ten of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.250" end="00:37:23.060" style="s2">food apps right you get to try these two</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.020" end="00:37:25.370" style="s2">food apps you gets it like that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.060" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">potentially get to have whether we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.370" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">to pay for in the beginning because</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:30.470" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to know us to jump on</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:31.940" style="s2">board or if we&#39;ve approached the food</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.470" end="00:37:34.010" style="s2">apps and say hey we need you to give us</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.940" end="00:37:36.170" style="s2">100 subscriptions to each of yours so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.010" end="00:37:37.460" style="s2">can rate you so we can say how good you</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.170" end="00:37:39.770" style="s2">are if you believe in your product you</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.460" end="00:37:41.090" style="s2">will and if you don&#39;t great let&#39;s put on</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.770" end="00:37:44.330" style="s2">our website that you wouldn&#39;t give us a</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.090" end="00:37:45.560" style="s2">hundred and you know oh that&#39;s fine we</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.330" end="00:37:47.060" style="s2">started here with one and we looked at</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.560" end="00:37:49.730" style="s2">features and benefits and we didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.060" end="00:37:51.170" style="s2">know we had one personally builder there</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.730" end="00:37:53.020" style="s2">are other things that can be perks that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.170" end="00:37:55.820" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily paying them for their</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.020" end="00:37:57.260" style="s2">mm-hmm further reading like Yelp doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.820" end="00:37:59.240" style="s2">pay people to go to restaurants right</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.260" end="00:38:01.490" style="s2">they choose to go to the the restaurants</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.240" end="00:38:04.460" style="s2">they pay for it and then they they rate</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.490" end="00:38:05.930" style="s2">it based on based on that but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.460" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">there could be people who want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.930" end="00:38:12.950" style="s2">$10 a month for together tech because of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:14.570" style="s2">the vision and those people are game B</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.950" end="00:38:16.760" style="s2">people right even if they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.570" end="00:38:18.350" style="s2">what game B is there are people who want</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.760" end="00:38:19.700" style="s2">a better world they can see how tech</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.350" end="00:38:21.950" style="s2">gets us there that we owned together</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.700" end="00:38:24.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not getting a catalogue of apps</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.950" end="00:38:25.490" style="s2">for their $10 a month they&#39;re getting to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.200" end="00:38:26.900" style="s2">know they were in from the ground floor</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.490" end="00:38:29.060" style="s2">right they&#39;re getting to co-create</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.900" end="00:38:31.910" style="s2">together tech like that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.060" end="00:38:33.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s like right if you enjoy that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.910" end="00:38:37.610" style="s2">process getting to watch the videos</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.560" end="00:38:39.740" style="s2">getting to be getting to participate</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.610" end="00:38:41.360" style="s2">being on the zoom conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.740" end="00:38:45.020" style="s2">getting your say in it and putting</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.360" end="00:38:46.550" style="s2">putting that piece in it I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.020" end="00:38:47.780" style="s2">necessarily I don&#39;t know how to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.550" end="00:38:49.490" style="s2">enough people on board to make that</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.780" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">feasible right we don&#39;t need ten people</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.490" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">paying $10 a month we need like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:57.530" style="s2">thousand people paying $10 but yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:59.780" style="s2">I was wondering though if it&#39;s worth the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.530" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">while to even though it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.780" end="00:39:05.390" style="s2">enough money to do anything just to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:06.710" style="s2">start it off correct or start off with</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.390" end="00:39:09.320" style="s2">that process of go ahead start</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.710" end="00:39:12.740" style="s2">collecting the funds but then we&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.320" end="00:39:14.930" style="s2">have to decide what tech to use for that</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.740" end="00:39:16.660" style="s2">like you could use patreon some people</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.930" end="00:39:17.830" style="s2">concerned about patreon you could use</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.660" end="00:39:20.140" style="s2">PayPal</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.830" end="00:39:24.940" style="s2">which not real happy with paypal at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.140" end="00:39:27.540" style="s2">moment just to kind of kind of get the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.940" end="00:39:30.730" style="s2">get the ball rolling and the culture of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.540" end="00:39:32.110" style="s2">kind of donating to this process</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.730" end="00:39:35.380" style="s2">of course they would be getting a value</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.110" end="00:39:37.720" style="s2">back but would the value</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.380" end="00:39:39.930" style="s2">I just kind of used the term kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.720" end="00:39:44.080" style="s2">donation or because it&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.930" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">values not quite commiserate for ten</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.080" end="00:39:50.110" style="s2">dollars a month maybe I agree and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:51.730" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t start at ten dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.110" end="00:39:53.470" style="s2">maybe in the beginning we start and sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.730" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">enough but honestly ten dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.470" end="00:39:55.810" style="s2">because they aren&#39;t really getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:39:58.180" style="s2">anything for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.810" end="00:40:00.250" style="s2">ten dollars a month isn&#39;t a lot for most</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.180" end="00:40:01.990" style="s2">people it is enough for their life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.250" end="00:40:04.410" style="s2">basically like you&#39;re donating it right</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.990" end="00:40:09.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like tapping into people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.410" end="00:40:11.140" style="s2">altruistic nature not their financials</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.070" end="00:40:12.820" style="s2">like that this is gonna pay off because</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.140" end="00:40:14.320" style="s2">it&#39;s never gonna pay off as far as</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.820" end="00:40:15.460" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get dividends you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.320" end="00:40:17.290" style="s2">gonna go that&#39;s not true you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.460" end="00:40:19.420" style="s2">get big dividends but like game B</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.290" end="00:40:21.310" style="s2">dividends right like anything that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.420" end="00:40:22.780" style="s2">put in that we get back everybody gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.310" end="00:40:24.370" style="s2">back it&#39;s not because you were in at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.780" end="00:40:26.470" style="s2">ground floor like you get access to all</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.370" end="00:40:27.880" style="s2">of the tech we create but you get to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.470" end="00:40:29.290" style="s2">you were in from the beginning you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.880" end="00:40:31.210" style="s2">to say you were in from this period of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.290" end="00:40:34.060" style="s2">time and I think there are people in</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.210" end="00:40:35.500" style="s2">game B who have money and believe in it</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.060" end="00:40:37.390" style="s2">enough that they would put in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.500" end="00:40:40.750" style="s2">where it might be understandable to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.390" end="00:40:42.340" style="s2">like $1 a month to say I care about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.750" end="00:40:43.900" style="s2">but that&#39;s what I can afford because if</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.340" end="00:40:45.460" style="s2">this wasn&#39;t my project that would be how</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.900" end="00:40:46.870" style="s2">much I would put into it like I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.460" end="00:40:49.780" style="s2">like without a month to put this forward</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.870" end="00:40:51.640" style="s2">yeah this it&#39;s my project even though</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.780" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m like a single mom on disability</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.640" end="00:40:55.150" style="s2">I would put $10 a month in to say yes I</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.680" end="00:40:57.580" style="s2">believe in this this is like how we</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.150" end="00:40:59.350" style="s2">create game B but there can also be</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.580" end="00:41:02.770" style="s2">people who possibly go upwards of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.350" end="00:41:04.180" style="s2">know 50 $100 a month if it&#39;s not if</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.770" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">they&#39;re really if there&#39;s someone who</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.180" end="00:41:07.720" style="s2">has the funds to be able to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:09.550" style="s2">they believe in this right to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.720" end="00:41:11.800" style="s2">say the issue is you don&#39;t get more of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.550" end="00:41:14.170" style="s2">stay in it for that amount so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.800" end="00:41:17.260" style="s2">you gets more altruistic points right</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.170" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">more like I saw the vision of this back</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.260" end="00:41:23.680" style="s2">in the day and I gave yeah so gave me</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:28.750" style="s2">some recognition that would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.680" end="00:41:31.770" style="s2">perk yeah so one of my similar ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.750" end="00:41:31.770" style="s2">the one you mentioned about</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.339" end="00:41:41.019" style="s2">what was it so having a website review</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.220" end="00:41:43.450" style="s2">that reminds me of another thing where I</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.019" end="00:41:45.489" style="s2">was think about that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.450" end="00:41:47.470" style="s2">potential first apps might also be like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.489" end="00:41:51.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what else to call it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.470" end="00:41:55.059" style="s2">kind of a self-help app so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.670" end="00:41:57.099" style="s2">thinking of some ways to have people be</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.059" end="00:42:00.099" style="s2">able to kind of enter where they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.099" end="00:42:01.930" style="s2">like mentally financially physically and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.099" end="00:42:07.450" style="s2">all this stuff and it would help them</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.930" end="00:42:09.819" style="s2">craft a plan and would then guide them</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.450" end="00:42:11.799" style="s2">to other resources because we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.819" end="00:42:14.109" style="s2">to reinvent anything if there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.799" end="00:42:17.769" style="s2">video on how to do push-ups correctly</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.109" end="00:42:19.450" style="s2">then we would link to that but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.769" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">we&#39;re in the information age and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.450" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">overloaded with information just having</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:27.999" style="s2">a process that would kind of sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:33.220" style="s2">through all that information and give</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.999" end="00:42:35.589" style="s2">you some guidance I think would be very</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.220" end="00:42:39.549" style="s2">helpful and could be call so kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.589" end="00:42:41.980" style="s2">crowd-sourced information and so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.549" end="00:42:43.390" style="s2">kind of that just when you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.980" end="00:42:44.950" style="s2">website review it reminded me that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.390" end="00:42:46.539" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of similar I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.950" end="00:42:49.599" style="s2">this would be more of a review of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.539" end="00:42:58.140" style="s2">everything that could that you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:43:00.789" style="s2">potentially use like reading almost like</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.140" end="00:43:02.680" style="s2">goal-setting groups right like we want</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.789" end="00:43:04.059" style="s2">to run a marathon and you create a group</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.680" end="00:43:04.989" style="s2">and you can I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.059" end="00:43:05.950" style="s2">zooming them if you&#39;re running a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.989" end="00:43:08.109" style="s2">marathon that maybe you can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.950" end="00:43:10.390" style="s2">writing partners your spacing or just an</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.109" end="00:43:12.700" style="s2">accountability group right well also</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.390" end="00:43:14.950" style="s2">having the resources I&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.700" end="00:43:17.410" style="s2">because that&#39;s the connection piece is</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.950" end="00:43:18.940" style="s2">missing in so many people&#39;s lives if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.410" end="00:43:22.809" style="s2">give them that connection if we give</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.940" end="00:43:24.339" style="s2">them a way to be able to jump on and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.809" end="00:43:26.529" style="s2">find people without having to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.339" end="00:43:28.239" style="s2">so social media doesn&#39;t do is it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.529" end="00:43:30.009" style="s2">assign you friends okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.239" end="00:43:31.869" style="s2">you have to bring your own and some</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.009" end="00:43:34.720" style="s2">people don&#39;t have them some people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.869" end="00:43:36.700" style="s2">have the safety around them that has</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.720" end="00:43:38.950" style="s2">that so I don&#39;t know if that appeals to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.700" end="00:43:40.779" style="s2">you but like with her it&#39;s like hey if</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.950" end="00:43:44.590" style="s2">you want to work out here are people to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.779" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">kind of do that with or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.590" end="00:43:52.180" style="s2">I think that&#39;s great idea it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:54.130" style="s2">something I would have thought of but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.180" end="00:43:57.010" style="s2">think that&#39;s great and I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.130" end="00:43:58.780" style="s2">could see that as being part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.010" end="00:44:02.440" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know if that fits under</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.780" end="00:44:04.870" style="s2">kind the idea cafe or if it&#39;s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.440" end="00:44:06.970" style="s2">it&#39;s really kind of a separate thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.870" end="00:44:09.700" style="s2">well how do you think about that well</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.970" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">with the idea cafe the first iteration</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.700" end="00:44:14.350" style="s2">in my head was like we have once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">created and it&#39;s its own platform we</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.350" end="00:44:18.130" style="s2">start out with one question a day and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:20.440" style="s2">everybody answers that same question and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.130" end="00:44:22.120" style="s2">then I found it hard to get people kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.440" end="00:44:23.740" style="s2">of on board to have my 11:00 a.m. on</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.120" end="00:44:25.750" style="s2">Wednesday conversation when I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.740" end="00:44:28.300" style="s2">create the question so then I changed it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.750" end="00:44:29.710" style="s2">that I found I&#39;m finding one person we</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.300" end="00:44:31.540" style="s2">co-create a question together that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.710" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">want to answer and then we put set a</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.540" end="00:44:35.590" style="s2">time and the worst that happens is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:37.900" style="s2">there&#39;s two of us right which is great</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.590" end="00:44:40.060" style="s2">it&#39;s actually great conversations so</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.900" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">then it changed it in my head I was like</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.060" end="00:44:44.920" style="s2">okay this thing isn&#39;t necessarily for</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:49.860" style="s2">building together tech together this</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.920" end="00:44:52.150" style="s2">thing is for connection with people so</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.860" end="00:44:53.740" style="s2">creating a question and saying here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.150" end="00:44:54.760" style="s2">your time period and you can if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.740" end="00:44:55.750" style="s2">not available during that time period</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.760" end="00:44:59.710" style="s2">but you want to answer that question</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.750" end="00:45:00.670" style="s2">like there&#39;s ways to say yes I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.710" end="00:45:02.260" style="s2">love to answer any of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.670" end="00:45:04.360" style="s2">and here&#39;s my availability we match</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.260" end="00:45:05.950" style="s2">people up to have conversations with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.360" end="00:45:08.830" style="s2">minimum of two and maximum of four</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.950" end="00:45:11.620" style="s2">people and in that way it could it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.830" end="00:45:13.390" style="s2">like it&#39;s random degree right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.620" end="00:45:14.530" style="s2">just randomly getting assign to three or</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.390" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">four people and that will work for some</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.530" end="00:45:17.860" style="s2">people and it&#39;ll be amazing and other</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.760" end="00:45:19.330" style="s2">people want to talk to the same people</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.860" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">again and again and kind of form an</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.330" end="00:45:26.380" style="s2">actual community and so I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:28.420" style="s2">ways to do all of that with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.380" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">platform right we&#39;re like it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.420" end="00:45:31.420" style="s2">individual getting what they need and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:33.220" style="s2">what they want and the backend</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.420" end="00:45:34.990" style="s2">facilitating that so you have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.220" end="00:45:37.390" style="s2">dashboard of like oh here&#39;s the group&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.990" end="00:45:38.770" style="s2">where I&#39;m like talking about parenting</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.390" end="00:45:40.780" style="s2">and I want those to be much more</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.770" end="00:45:43.660" style="s2">intimate and I want to know those people</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.780" end="00:45:45.070" style="s2">here&#39;s my game be creation ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.660" end="00:45:46.420" style="s2">like I don&#39;t care who I matched up with</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.070" end="00:45:49.150" style="s2">anyone yeah we&#39;ll talk about anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.420" end="00:45:50.380" style="s2">that related and other ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.150" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">like autistic people with their special</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.380" end="00:45:52.840" style="s2">interests like I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:56.020" style="s2">trades all day every day I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.840" end="00:45:57.250" style="s2">who what&#39;s around right and or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.020" end="00:45:58.180" style="s2">they do want to have the same people</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.250" end="00:46:00.940" style="s2">again and again</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.180" end="00:46:02.680" style="s2">and having it be very individually</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.940" end="00:46:03.130" style="s2">focused like what&#39;s gonna add to your</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.680" end="00:46:06.190" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.130" end="00:46:07.990" style="s2">and having that be also goal setting</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.190" end="00:46:10.600" style="s2">right that there&#39;s that piece of it that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.990" end="00:46:11.890" style="s2">gives you we have a goal to create</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.600" end="00:46:14.010" style="s2">together because there&#39;s not many brains</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.890" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">in the room right I mean if you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.010" end="00:46:18.520" style="s2">four people who want to go on a specific</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:20.230" style="s2">diet they want to start doing keto even</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.520" end="00:46:22.360" style="s2">if none of them know anything about keto</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.230" end="00:46:23.590" style="s2">together being able to create that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.360" end="00:46:24.970" style="s2">then especially if there&#39;s a way to give</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.590" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">that to the next group who starts it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.970" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">right be like hey we did the research</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:28.900" style="s2">and this is what we did this is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:30.490" style="s2">YouTube video that we found and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.900" end="00:46:34.360" style="s2">explained it well and here are the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.490" end="00:46:39.790" style="s2">people that works for ya or there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.360" end="00:46:42.580" style="s2">yeah yeah in in the idea cafe you do</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.790" end="00:46:44.410" style="s2">have towards the question I think at one</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.580" end="00:46:46.180" style="s2">point you&#39;re suggesting that is also</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.410" end="00:46:51.970" style="s2">being part of the decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.180" end="00:46:53.470" style="s2">process for together tech my concern</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.970" end="00:46:56.460" style="s2">about that or my thought about that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.470" end="00:47:00.910" style="s2">how can we make sure that that that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.460" end="00:47:03.820" style="s2">the learnings accumulate from those</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.910" end="00:47:05.560" style="s2">meetings otherwise someone would have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.820" end="00:47:09.370" style="s2">kind of like sit through a majority the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.560" end="00:47:11.470" style="s2">meetings to be to consume that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.370" end="00:47:16.060" style="s2">conversation and although we&#39;d want them</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.470" end="00:47:18.340" style="s2">to participate there there I would I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.060" end="00:47:21.160" style="s2">like there to be some way for knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.340" end="00:47:23.110" style="s2">to build I don&#39;t know if you thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.160" end="00:47:24.280" style="s2">through that yet I haven&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.110" end="00:47:26.470" style="s2">through it as far as I know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.280" end="00:47:29.020" style="s2">thing that needs to happen but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.470" end="00:47:32.020" style="s2">have B solution for it in the world cafe</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.020" end="00:47:34.180" style="s2">it&#39;s an in-person option that like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.020" end="00:47:36.100" style="s2">for-profit or not-for-profit does with</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.180" end="00:47:37.780" style="s2">like dozens or hundreds of people and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.100" end="00:47:39.280" style="s2">it&#39;s for a set period of time right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.780" end="00:47:40.750" style="s2">for four hours that they&#39;re answering</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:42.370" style="s2">questions around tables and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.750" end="00:47:44.140" style="s2">drawing on the they&#39;re drawing on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.370" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">tablecloth like they have paper there</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.140" end="00:47:46.990" style="s2">and they take some paper with them and a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:49.060" style="s2">and so you kind of collect those and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.990" end="00:47:51.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the the piece the online world</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.060" end="00:47:55.120" style="s2">cafe does it on a Google Doc for each</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.460" end="00:47:59.590" style="s2">table or like 20 people participating go</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.120" end="00:48:01.390" style="s2">and kind of like will type in if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.590" end="00:48:03.100" style="s2">want to go by I was never a table where</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.390" end="00:48:04.810" style="s2">we wanted to actually take notes I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.100" end="00:48:06.580" style="s2">like the point isn&#39;t necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.810" end="00:48:08.500" style="s2">it&#39;s continued learning it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.580" end="00:48:10.270" style="s2">change right that you leave a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.500" end="00:48:13.030" style="s2">person you are you&#39;re the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.270" end="00:48:14.650" style="s2">like you&#39;re the one continually going on</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.030" end="00:48:17.320" style="s2">so if people are participating one-off</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.650" end="00:48:19.150" style="s2">conversations it&#39;s still part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.320" end="00:48:20.560" style="s2">participatory group who some of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.150" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">people will have been at yesterday&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.560" end="00:48:22.990" style="s2">the day before and the day before and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">other people this is their first time</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.990" end="00:48:26.020" style="s2">the questions are designed in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.180" style="s2">but you don&#39;t necessarily need to know</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.020" end="00:48:31.510" style="s2">that but it would be great to have like</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.310" end="00:49:22.900" style="s2">clearly important um yeah awesome so</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.680" end="00:49:24.850" style="s2">yeah so idea Cafe is is both a benefit</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.900" end="00:49:27.850" style="s2">in itself of just having people talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.850" end="00:49:30.940" style="s2">people finding community people having</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.850" end="00:49:34.230" style="s2">interaction more meaningful than current</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.940" end="00:49:38.859" style="s2">social media but also it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.230" end="00:49:40.690" style="s2">co-creation process for together tech as</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.859" end="00:49:44.740" style="s2">well or can that&#39;s one of the potential</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.690" end="00:49:46.900" style="s2">uses of idea Cafe right absolutely so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.740" end="00:49:49.540" style="s2">would yeah I have some tech that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.900" end="00:49:56.020" style="s2">could also look at for that I know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.540" end="00:49:57.460" style="s2">founder of Kiko chat Qi qo chat comm he</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.020" end="00:49:59.560" style="s2">has it&#39;s where you can have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.460" end="00:50:01.480" style="s2">like 50 people and then there&#39;s breakout</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.560" end="00:50:03.100" style="s2">rooms and in the current iteration I</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.480" end="00:50:04.750" style="s2">think you choose which breakout room you</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.100" end="00:50:06.070" style="s2">want to go to based on topic which is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.750" end="00:50:08.109" style="s2">little different although he might have</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.070" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">a random assignment and it has it built</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.109" end="00:50:14.170" style="s2">in instead of Google Docs it uses an</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:17.800" style="s2">open-source version of Google Docs it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.170" end="00:50:20.760" style="s2">like I&#39;m just gonna say a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.800" end="00:50:23.320" style="s2">bones are there for similar processes</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.760" end="00:50:25.720" style="s2">and so we could see whether that fits</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.320" end="00:50:27.550" style="s2">the need or if he would be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.720" end="00:50:30.130" style="s2">augment his system or if we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.550" end="00:50:32.380" style="s2">develop you know it&#39;s just an option to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.130" end="00:50:34.090" style="s2">look at yeah no that&#39;s cool I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.380" end="00:50:35.410" style="s2">to reinvent things that are don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.090" end="00:50:36.730" style="s2">to be reinvented so I was like will you</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.410" end="00:50:37.060" style="s2">zoom because I know they have breakout</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.730" end="00:50:39.010" style="s2">rooms</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.060" end="00:50:40.770" style="s2">Jordan was talking about one of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.010" end="00:50:43.150" style="s2">friends Daniel was also talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.770" end="00:50:44.350" style="s2">the idea that the World Cafe is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.150" end="00:50:45.610" style="s2">you&#39;re assigned to people you sit there</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.350" end="00:50:47.350" style="s2">and talk for 20 minutes then you leave</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.610" end="00:50:49.240" style="s2">there&#39;s another type of iteration of</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.350" end="00:50:51.790" style="s2">that where you have a central room and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.240" end="00:50:53.830" style="s2">then someone will pick a question and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.790" end="00:50:55.330" style="s2">they&#39;ll form a group around that let go</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.830" end="00:50:56.650" style="s2">off and talk and then you kind of vote</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.330" end="00:50:58.150" style="s2">with your feet where if the quite big</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.650" end="00:50:59.290" style="s2">conversation so everyone doing water</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.150" end="00:51:02.410" style="s2">someone&#39;s been authorized that you go</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.290" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">back to the main group and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.410" end="00:51:06.490" style="s2">enough of you there that&#39;s when you then</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:08.680" style="s2">can form a new group and pick a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.490" end="00:51:09.700" style="s2">question and I&#39;m wondering if when you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.680" end="00:51:11.350" style="s2">actually because that sounded like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.700" end="00:51:14.560" style="s2">great I was like that sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.350" end="00:51:18.040" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s open spaces are open yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.560" end="00:51:21.810" style="s2">yeah yeah I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been to one of those</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.040" end="00:51:21.810" style="s2">wants in real life it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.930" end="00:51:26.230" style="s2">kyouko chat because it&#39;s like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.760" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">breakout groups you can come back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.230" end="00:51:31.000" style="s2">yeah so you care yeah each person could</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:32.860" style="s2">that has the topic can make down rooms</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.000" end="00:51:34.810" style="s2">they&#39;ve no one shows up and no one shows</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.860" end="00:51:36.420" style="s2">up people can come it coming out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.810" end="00:51:39.670" style="s2">know the room see I would be like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.420" end="00:51:42.250" style="s2">virtual form of that which also has</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.670" end="00:51:48.820" style="s2">video and it uses zoom in the background</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.250" end="00:51:50.680" style="s2">as its video host company yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.820" end="00:51:53.560" style="s2">that&#39;s one potential so yeah so as we</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.680" end="00:51:55.330" style="s2">kind of get together and talk these</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.560" end="00:51:57.400" style="s2">times and with whoever else ends up</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.330" end="00:51:59.070" style="s2">joining yeah talking through kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.400" end="00:52:03.220" style="s2">each of these ideas and just seeing</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.070" end="00:52:04.420" style="s2">where where we want to take it next yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.220" end="00:52:07.900" style="s2">because there&#39;s Prout there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.420" end="00:52:08.980" style="s2">complexity of the thing there is how</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.900" end="00:52:10.840" style="s2">much it would cost to make it which</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.980" end="00:52:13.090" style="s2">honestly I don&#39;t know because I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.840" end="00:52:15.310" style="s2">tech person I&#39;m just like magic happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.090" end="00:52:16.660" style="s2">and then it&#39;s made right you guys will</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.310" end="00:52:18.700" style="s2">have a more of an understanding people</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.660" end="00:52:20.350" style="s2">in tech of like how complicated it is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.700" end="00:52:21.190" style="s2">make and whether you could do it or</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.350" end="00:52:23.410" style="s2">whether would have to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.190" end="00:52:24.850" style="s2">someone else doing it anyone Cody and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.410" end="00:52:26.470" style="s2">feel like has to get paid unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.850" end="00:52:27.640" style="s2">like an afternoon project which aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.470" end="00:52:31.930" style="s2">even know if there&#39;s anything that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.640" end="00:52:33.370" style="s2">afternoon project but yeah that like</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.930" end="00:52:35.170" style="s2">there&#39;s different funding models there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.370" end="00:52:36.940" style="s2">like that&#39;s where the labor platform is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.170" end="00:52:38.920" style="s2">an instant funding model</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.940" end="00:52:41.530" style="s2">funds basically everything else but and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.920" end="00:52:43.630" style="s2">starting with one like cleaners right</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.530" end="00:52:46.119" style="s2">like what how do we bring cleaners on</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.630" end="00:52:47.890" style="s2">board and and do and do that piece it</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.119" end="00:52:49.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be all labor</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.890" end="00:52:50.740" style="s2">all of the time and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.300" end="00:52:51.730" style="s2">constantly looking like how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.740" end="00:52:53.800" style="s2">your life easier</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.730" end="00:52:55.500" style="s2">cleaners right and that eventually we</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.800" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">figure out health care right like well</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.500" end="00:53:01.089" style="s2">everyone can have health care who&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:02.560" style="s2">of our platform who wouldn&#39;t right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.089" end="00:53:05.050" style="s2">in the States and Canada maybe less so</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.560" end="00:53:06.730" style="s2">but even in Canada our people work</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.050" end="00:53:09.369" style="s2">places like Starbucks for extended</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.730" end="00:53:10.660" style="s2">health benefits be able to come on board</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.369" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">and be like yeah I work one hour a week</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.660" end="00:53:19.170" style="s2">but I can buy into my health care plan</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:21.640" style="s2">yes it&#39;s amazing yeah yeah so probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.170" end="00:53:26.710" style="s2">start kind of listing these ideas out</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.640" end="00:53:31.050" style="s2">and figuring out where we want to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.710" end="00:53:34.480" style="s2">the next step for which ones are however</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.050" end="00:53:36.220" style="s2">we want to do it yeah sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.480" end="00:53:37.510" style="s2">like brainstorming a little bit more I</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.220" end="00:53:40.000" style="s2">get excited about just talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.510" end="00:53:41.800" style="s2">idea itself and then brainstorming like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.000" end="00:53:43.060" style="s2">what a beta of it would look like right</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.800" end="00:53:46.210" style="s2">or what mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.060" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">not a beta what the like game the final</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.210" end="00:53:50.940" style="s2">product looks like then like and bring</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:50.940" style="s2">it back to reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.180" end="00:53:57.339" style="s2">get your big vision yeah yeah and I do</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">kind of see all of these this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.339" end="00:54:04.589" style="s2">game be experiments on trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:10.180" style="s2">game be and in the real world and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.589" end="00:54:13.569" style="s2">iterate which is my my leaning more on</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.180" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">that side rather than the kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.569" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">be self improvement which I I do myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:26.859" style="s2">but I am also eager to start kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:28.660" style="s2">playing around with it yeah I I came up</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.859" end="00:54:30.490" style="s2">with the idea and then I had to do self</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.660" end="00:54:33.310" style="s2">improvement to get there and I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.490" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">that a fault of game B is that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.310" end="00:54:37.869" style="s2">to almost require people have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:39.880" style="s2">level of interpersonal development in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.869" end="00:54:41.800" style="s2">order to participate which is OK for</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.880" end="00:54:43.569" style="s2">game B in those spaces at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.800" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t think together tech can require</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.569" end="00:54:47.020" style="s2">that like you don&#39;t need to have a</p>

<p begin="00:54:58.609" end="00:55:02.750" style="s2">conversation and that requires you to</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:04.730" style="s2">just show up as you are there might be</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.750" end="00:55:06.500" style="s2">conflict because of that and we deal</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.730" end="00:55:09.079" style="s2">with that and possibly separate people</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.500" end="00:55:11.630" style="s2">based on their conflict but those kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.079" end="00:55:13.250" style="s2">of things like how do we if we do think</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.630" end="00:55:14.839" style="s2">we&#39;re more personally you know like</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.520" end="00:55:27.559" style="s2">Cory not yeah and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.710" end="00:55:29.030" style="s2">people recognize game B&#39;s well a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.559" end="00:55:31.190" style="s2">people wanted to happen pretty soon but</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.030" end="00:55:34.220" style="s2">we don&#39;t even really know what it is yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.190" end="00:55:35.900" style="s2">right but there there there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.220" end="00:55:38.089" style="s2">transitionary things like I threw a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.900" end="00:55:39.470" style="s2">project idea in there in it I said well</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.089" end="00:55:41.299" style="s2">it&#39;s just kind of game B because it has</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.470" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">some of the philosophy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.299" end="00:55:51.190" style="s2">competitive so so but people seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.440" end="00:55:53.150" style="s2">of the opinion that it&#39;s okay to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.190" end="00:55:55.099" style="s2">something that&#39;s encouraging people</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.150" end="00:55:57.559" style="s2">towards game B even if it has a little</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.099" end="00:56:04.010" style="s2">bit of game a left in it as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.559" end="00:56:05.630" style="s2">transitionary tech and so that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.010" end="00:56:07.849" style="s2">that may be necessary just like you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.630" end="00:56:10.970" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about something using you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.849" end="00:56:13.730" style="s2">know today&#39;s monetary standards but in</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.970" end="00:56:15.349" style="s2">the future you know and we&#39;re using kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.730" end="00:56:17.900" style="s2">of the standard some of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.349" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">incentives it&#39;s hard to just jump</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.900" end="00:56:24.559" style="s2">straight to the ideal game B without</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">having some steps in between absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.559" end="00:56:28.819" style="s2">I think that&#39;s fair I mean we have to</p>
