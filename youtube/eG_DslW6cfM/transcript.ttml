<p begin="00:00:04.710" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">of the idea cafe is to be a space where</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.200" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">everyone can just show up be who they</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">are and we can have a fun and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">meaningful conversation around a</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:19.500" style="s2">question and showcase that everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:20.939" style="s2">something to give and hopefully we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.500" end="00:00:22.289" style="s2">to share in each other&#39;s influence a</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:25.019" style="s2">little bit people get to bring on board</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">their followers and viewers and we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.019" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">to share that amongst amongst other</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">people as well once we have the video</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:33.710" style="s2">description I see we actually have some</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:35.850" style="s2">live viewers too we didn&#39;t last week so</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.710" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">everyone&#39;s muted at the moment but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.850" end="00:00:38.760" style="s2">gonna ask I&#39;m gonna ask the question and</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">then whoever wants to go first can just</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.760" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">raise their hands and I will unmute them</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:46.020" style="s2">and drop everybody else down including</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">myself so you have the room or the space</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.020" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">I&#39;m the ideas need share for roughly</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">five minutes I will have a timer on but</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">share and then I will pop back on when</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">you have about 30 seconds left so feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">free to wrap up and and finish and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">feel like five minutes is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">long time to share for so don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">like you need to share until you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:09.350" style="s2">and then or when I pop on another thirty</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:12.420" style="s2">seconds okay so this week&#39;s question is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.350" end="00:01:21.450" style="s2">what does a beautiful future look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.420" end="00:01:24.950" style="s2">to you when anyone wants to wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.450" end="00:01:24.950" style="s2">we can just sit with that for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:48.050" style="s2">I I guess I&#39;ll go okay I&#39;m so awesome</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.060" end="00:01:48.050" style="s2">just trying to figure how about the moon</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.940" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">hi i&#39;m ramsey he him i my daughter and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:58.410" style="s2">started common to planet common - planet</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">org</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.410" end="00:02:06.420" style="s2">our beautiful idea is a global reset and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:08.430" style="s2">then we would issue a global currency to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.420" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">each person they would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.430" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">convert their existing wealth into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:14.580" style="s2">new global currency in addition we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">have a starting balance because most</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.580" end="00:02:18.390" style="s2">people don&#39;t have any money so it could</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:20.580" style="s2">be something like say three thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.390" end="00:02:22.140" style="s2">times your age so that everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.580" end="00:02:25.860" style="s2">this new currency to start playing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:28.770" style="s2">new game with we could make the currency</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.860" end="00:02:32.070" style="s2">issued as a ubi recognizing that each</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.770" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">human has value certainly potential</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.070" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">value and then we could also allow each</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:40.230" style="s2">person to collect more of this money</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:42.989" style="s2">through proof of value things like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.230" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">know learning playing or working those</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.989" end="00:02:48.570" style="s2">are all activities that benefit the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">individual and by extension benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.570" end="00:02:53.400" style="s2">produce value for the whole and so and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:55.790" style="s2">then of course we can also and this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.400" end="00:02:57.989" style="s2">the neat part we could also allow</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.790" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">enterprises that is groups of people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.989" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">are doing something already</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">collaboratively together either building</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">products or service and allow those</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">enterprises to earn more money based on</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:13.980" style="s2">metrics other than mere production</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">things like did they improve their</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.980" end="00:03:18.269" style="s2">efficiencies are they producing products</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">that are renewable reusable recyclable</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.269" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">upgradable etc and so the enterprises in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:25.950" style="s2">this game would not necessarily be</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">competing to outsell one another but</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.950" end="00:03:32.160" style="s2">rather to produce the best quality</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">product or service that is beneficial to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.160" end="00:03:38.040" style="s2">the the whole so then the the trick with</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">this currency of those unlike money</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.040" end="00:03:44.160" style="s2">today this currency once you earn it you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.940" end="00:03:47.209" style="s2">will use it and it will get consumed and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.160" end="00:03:51.420" style="s2">deleted so there is no concern about</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.209" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">creating currency that is producers</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.420" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">property and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:57.060" style="s2">circulates and inflates so here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">that would work so then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.060" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">currency you go to the grocery store you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:04.409" style="s2">go half the food maybe free because</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty and there&#39;s no need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.409" end="00:04:07.140" style="s2">compete for it</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.400" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">the other half you may have to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.140" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">so when you do pay for it the currency</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:13.730" style="s2">gets deleted from your account and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">gets deleted and you consume the food</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.730" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">now the money does not have to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.709" end="00:04:21.000" style="s2">enterprise that is the person who</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.310" style="s2">produced it the farmer because what</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.000" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here is we&#39;re recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.310" end="00:04:29.070" style="s2">that the product was produced from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:30.750" style="s2">Commons right in order for anything to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.070" end="00:04:33.270" style="s2">be produced has to come from the earth</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.750" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">and so none of that can really be owned</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.270" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">by any person at least it shouldn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:40.289" style="s2">can be controlled by people certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:41.789" style="s2">and it is but certainly not owned so and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.289" end="00:04:45.210" style="s2">also you have to recall here in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.789" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">equation the farmers were already paid</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.210" end="00:04:49.650" style="s2">for their labor so they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:51.960" style="s2">collecting money to produce the the food</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.650" end="00:04:54.750" style="s2">they don&#39;t need your money on the back</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.960" end="00:04:58.139" style="s2">end okay so that&#39;s one neat function</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.750" end="00:05:00.419" style="s2">there so what that would allow us to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.139" end="00:05:02.310" style="s2">is it would allow us to make everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.419" end="00:05:05.010" style="s2">the comments all enterprises all</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.310" end="00:05:07.289" style="s2">buildings your entire city would be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.010" end="00:05:09.419" style="s2">game that we play in terms of inputting</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.289" end="00:05:10.410" style="s2">information on what&#39;s being used was not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.419" end="00:05:12.539" style="s2">being used</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.410" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">you&#39;ve got office space that&#39;s unused</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.539" end="00:05:16.770" style="s2">you would literally you know go on your</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">application and you can form your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.770" end="00:05:20.310" style="s2">group whatever it is that you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.470" style="s2">pursue could be an engineering could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.310" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">you know building something it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.470" end="00:05:27.780" style="s2">matter you would request lease of the of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:30.120" style="s2">the of the office just like you would a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.780" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">library book for free and then you would</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.120" end="00:05:33.800" style="s2">occupy the office for whatever a period</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:36.750" style="s2">of time that you and your group are</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.800" end="00:05:38.340" style="s2">endeavoring towards your purpose and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:40.919" style="s2">would you know essentially create money</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.340" end="00:05:42.710" style="s2">for yourself now the beautiful most</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.919" end="00:05:46.110" style="s2">beautiful thing about this particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.710" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2">equation is is that it completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.110" end="00:05:53.419" style="s2">changes our control of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">in that right now you&#39;re not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.419" end="00:05:57.810" style="s2">create value in the world based on your</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:06:00.150" style="s2">own morality in your own desire in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.810" end="00:06:02.969" style="s2">own expertise meaning you have to go out</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.150" end="00:06:04.979" style="s2">and accept a position a job from</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.969" end="00:06:06.100" style="s2">somebody else in the system you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.979" end="00:06:07.900" style="s2">agree to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.100" end="00:06:10.390" style="s2">something for and obviously we know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.900" end="00:06:12.430" style="s2">the reason why they want you to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.390" end="00:06:14.350" style="s2">so that they can exploit your labor and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.430" end="00:06:17.410" style="s2">make great value on the back end and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.350" end="00:06:19.720" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous so here you get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.410" end="00:06:23.020" style="s2">decide where to work when to work how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.720" end="00:06:27.070" style="s2">produce value with your you know local</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.020" end="00:06:28.690" style="s2">members and global I think that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.070" end="00:06:30.900" style="s2">much it for now it gets a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.690" end="00:06:35.470" style="s2">more complicated than that and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.900" end="00:06:36.700" style="s2">there is a piece of the property that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.470" end="00:06:39.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about which is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.700" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">residential part but the currency part</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.940" end="00:06:45.070" style="s2">is the core the concept that allows for</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.410" style="s2">us to basically change the game that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.070" end="00:06:50.200" style="s2">play in and in this particular economic</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.200" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">meaning we can&#39;t Institute through this</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.030" end="00:06:57.970" style="s2">game within capitalism because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:07:00.130" style="s2">currency our game is weaker it is only a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.970" end="00:07:02.590" style="s2">unit of exchange is now property so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.130" end="00:07:03.910" style="s2">means it deletes so that means we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.590" end="00:07:05.860" style="s2">compete against the other currencies</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.910" end="00:07:07.600" style="s2">because well once we use ours ours is</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.650" end="00:07:18.430" style="s2">possible we believe because we have</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.430" end="00:07:21.550" style="s2">actually create these accounts for every</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.620" end="00:07:29.470" style="s2">mapping we can provide these tools for</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.460" end="00:07:31.480" style="s2">people and this vision and then give</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.470" end="00:07:34.450" style="s2">them an opportunity to help us build it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.480" end="00:07:37.060" style="s2">develop it and maybe one day if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.450" end="00:07:38.410" style="s2">decide we can switch over to that new</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.060" end="00:07:41.110" style="s2">currency and begin playing the whole new</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.410" end="00:07:43.450" style="s2">game so that&#39;s our additional awesome</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.110" end="00:07:46.650" style="s2">thanks Remzi I know you we could talk</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.170" end="00:08:09.220" style="s2">Thank You Rosie Daniel Daniel and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.670" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">gonna drop down and start the Tim okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.220" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">sounds great well I love it a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:13.810" style="s2">what Wendy was talking about there and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.600" style="s2">one of the key things that I love is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.810" end="00:08:19.059" style="s2">piece around changing the game and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.600" end="00:08:22.509" style="s2">little little changes here and there</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.059" end="00:08:25.539" style="s2">changes how all of society and emerges</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.509" end="00:08:28.239" style="s2">so for me what a beautiful future looks</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.539" end="00:08:30.249" style="s2">like as individualized it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.239" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">it&#39;s fractal and it&#39;s diverse and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.249" end="00:08:35.289" style="s2">talk a little bit about what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">those so individualized we have in terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.289" end="00:08:43.899" style="s2">of Education in terms of lifestyle and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:45.879" style="s2">where we live in terms of health in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.899" end="00:08:48.100" style="s2">terms of what we&#39;re aiming for in life I</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.879" end="00:08:49.540" style="s2">I think we&#39;re in a place where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.100" end="00:08:52.230" style="s2">room for a lot more individualization</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.540" end="00:08:54.879" style="s2">there we have the the technology and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.230" end="00:08:57.399" style="s2">understanding to allow a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.879" end="00:08:59.970" style="s2">individualization there</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.399" end="00:09:03.220" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk maybe more some other time</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.970" end="00:09:05.199" style="s2">more dev deeply about that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.220" end="00:09:08.050" style="s2">connection I think that both being able</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.199" end="00:09:11.019" style="s2">to use online distributed connective</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.050" end="00:09:13.899" style="s2">tools to connect people to the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.019" end="00:09:15.730" style="s2">who are sometimes most like them</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.899" end="00:09:17.589" style="s2">sometimes people who are on trajectories</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.730" end="00:09:19.000" style="s2">that are similar to theirs but maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.589" end="00:09:20.920" style="s2">little bit before a little bit ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.000" end="00:09:23.740" style="s2">where they&#39;re at so that there can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.920" end="00:09:25.389" style="s2">mentorship going on so that we can find</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.740" end="00:09:28.660" style="s2">commonality of interests and I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.389" end="00:09:30.129" style="s2">some diversity and learn from that but</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.660" end="00:09:32.139" style="s2">also just in terms of face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.129" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">connection I think that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.139" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">through a period right now societally at</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:39.009" style="s2">least in Western cultures that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:41.800" style="s2">isolating for a lot of people and when</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.009" end="00:09:43.509" style="s2">we think about individualized it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.800" end="00:09:47.079" style="s2">of every person in their castle very</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.509" end="00:09:48.220" style="s2">boxed in very alone often and I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.079" end="00:09:49.870" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to be moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.220" end="00:09:53.290" style="s2">that I think that as we move more</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.870" end="00:09:54.819" style="s2">towards understanding where our</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.290" end="00:09:58.360" style="s2">happiness and satisfaction comes from</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.819" end="00:10:00.129" style="s2">internally that we can start moving more</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.360" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">towards actual connections well with</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.129" end="00:10:04.329" style="s2">other other people effectively as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:07.269" style="s2">and what I say fractal I mean that both</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.329" end="00:10:10.050" style="s2">of these things that individual is high</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.269" end="00:10:12.250" style="s2">utilization and that connectedness piece</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.050" end="00:10:15.069" style="s2">is something that rather for being</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.250" end="00:10:16.930" style="s2">imposed from on top being all based off</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.069" end="00:10:19.509" style="s2">of the equivalent of federal policies or</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.930" end="00:10:22.269" style="s2">other outfit than being all some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.509" end="00:10:24.220" style="s2">libertarian individualized way where</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.269" end="00:10:25.139" style="s2">each person sort of it&#39;s every person</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.220" end="00:10:28.630" style="s2">for himself</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.139" end="00:10:30.400" style="s2">there can be an iterative process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.630" end="00:10:33.430" style="s2">going in both directions and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.400" end="00:10:34.510" style="s2">have organic patterns kind of appear in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.430" end="00:10:36.040" style="s2">terms of how people are living the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.510" end="00:10:37.990" style="s2">communities they&#39;re forming and choosing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.040" end="00:10:39.580" style="s2">the work that&#39;s found within there and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.990" end="00:10:41.890" style="s2">then how those communities work together</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.580" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">to make a larger communities there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.890" end="00:10:44.470" style="s2">already in the Netherlands really</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.140" style="s2">interesting work going on with that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.470" end="00:10:48.700" style="s2">where you&#39;ll have cohousing communities</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.140" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">which then have a collective where</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.700" end="00:10:53.650" style="s2">multiple cohousing communities come</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">together and have a larger structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.650" end="00:10:57.100" style="s2">that they may so I think that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.510" end="00:11:00.430" style="s2">be a king piece I think that part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.100" end="00:11:01.870" style="s2">that that collaboration and frightful</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.430" end="00:11:03.130" style="s2">side helps I couldn&#39;t be around decision</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:04.930" style="s2">making I think we&#39;re gonna see a whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.130" end="00:11:07.620" style="s2">mosaic of different decision making</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.930" end="00:11:12.580" style="s2">techniques come in so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.620" end="00:11:15.490" style="s2">current majority rules anonymous vote</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.580" end="00:11:16.870" style="s2">democracy which which is made to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.490" end="00:11:19.390" style="s2">whole bunch of problems that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.870" end="00:11:21.400" style="s2">hundreds of years old I think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.390" end="00:11:23.800" style="s2">gonna find new ways using consensus</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.400" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">using socio cracy using different ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.800" end="00:11:27.970" style="s2">that are connected and that helped us</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:29.470" style="s2">come together to find the wisdom of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.970" end="00:11:31.990" style="s2">group and to then be able to make solid</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.470" end="00:11:33.970" style="s2">decisions together and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.990" end="00:11:36.340" style="s2">connecting the electronic components so</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.970" end="00:11:38.020" style="s2">that computers artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.340" end="00:11:40.090" style="s2">can help us with some of that but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.020" end="00:11:41.740" style="s2">of it is about learning communication</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.090" end="00:11:43.900" style="s2">skills learning how we talk to one</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.740" end="00:11:46.540" style="s2">another how we listen more important</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.900" end="00:11:49.030" style="s2">later on another and shifting culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.540" end="00:11:52.510" style="s2">towards trying to find why this in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.030" end="00:11:53.530" style="s2">interest of proof when I think I first I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:55.450" style="s2">think that a lot of what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.530" end="00:11:58.750" style="s2">be coming up to and what&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.450" end="00:12:00.220" style="s2">to be marvelous is understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.750" end="00:12:02.250" style="s2">celebrating the importance of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.220" end="00:12:05.470" style="s2">diversity that when you have monoculture</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.250" end="00:12:07.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of fragility and brutalist</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.470" end="00:12:10.360" style="s2">that&#39;s built into that and when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.150" end="00:12:13.660" style="s2">start to accept that various kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.360" end="00:12:14.710" style="s2">neurodiversity are a strength within the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.660" end="00:12:17.520" style="s2">culture and they bring a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.710" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">unique elements when you accept that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.520" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">sexual orientation and identity that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:22.960" style="s2">having having the whole spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:24.280" style="s2">what&#39;s there be something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.960" end="00:12:26.590" style="s2">acknowledged and accepted and celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.280" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">on that there&#39;s huge strength that comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.590" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">out of that on peoples culture and their</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:32.500" style="s2">heritage their unique meaning to their</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:37.060" style="s2">unique gifts the more those things can</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.500" end="00:12:38.440" style="s2">be brought out and again celebrated in</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.060" end="00:12:39.520" style="s2">terms of that uniqueness the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.440" end="00:12:42.040" style="s2">then work with each of those different</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.520" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">pieces to build something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.040" end="00:12:46.530" style="s2">and emergent that comes from it</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">change is going to keep on coming faster</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.530" end="00:12:51.690" style="s2">and faster and we&#39;re gonna have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:55.050" style="s2">how to be responsive to that and I think</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.830" end="00:17:54.780" style="s2">on their way to school and also safe in</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.900" end="00:17:57.490" style="s2">their school and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.780" end="00:17:59.020" style="s2">receive education that&#39;s proper</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.490" end="00:18:01.809" style="s2">education education that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.020" end="00:18:06.250" style="s2">whitewashed and to be able to make them</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.809" end="00:18:09.940" style="s2">so they are able to understand basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.250" end="00:18:13.059" style="s2">intricacies of history but also be able</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.940" end="00:18:14.200" style="s2">to perform Admiral II moving forward and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.059" end="00:18:16.690" style="s2">making the</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.020" end="00:18:23.860" style="s2">but rather upon an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.390" end="00:18:25.420" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s happened and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.860" end="00:18:29.350" style="s2">that to me is beautiful because a person</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.420" end="00:18:31.300" style="s2">will be able to to create for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.350" end="00:18:33.550" style="s2">and for others instead of being told</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.300" end="00:18:35.920" style="s2">what something was and that begins today</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.550" end="00:18:38.050" style="s2">a beautiful future for me is when every</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.180" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">understand what sex education actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.700" end="00:18:53.080" style="s2">is because we have an issue in the</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.790" end="00:19:10.540" style="s2">morality a beautiful future for me is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.110" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">telling people that sexuality is normal</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.540" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">and if we&#39;re going to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:16.360" style="s2">sexuality then we need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:19.720" style="s2">what it is and for me that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.360" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">because sexuality is beautiful being</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.720" end="00:19:25.930" style="s2">able to provide for each other to me is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:27.790" style="s2">beautiful the way we can do that in all</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.940" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">credit for them because they are very</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.000" end="00:20:30.820" style="s2">forward-looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:32.170" style="s2">and for me I believe that that starts</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.820" end="00:20:35.590" style="s2">right now in the decisions that we make</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.170" end="00:20:40.450" style="s2">today and I think that when we hear</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.590" end="00:20:43.480" style="s2">ideas like this they sound so you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.450" end="00:20:45.370" style="s2">alien to us but I think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.480" end="00:20:47.740" style="s2">thing as well a beautiful feature to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.370" end="00:20:50.740" style="s2">is beginning to listen to these things</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.740" end="00:20:52.420" style="s2">having to do with emotional positivity</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.740" end="00:20:54.250" style="s2">having to do with what we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.420" end="00:20:56.200" style="s2">global currency having to do with how</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.250" end="00:20:58.390" style="s2">we&#39;re going to remove nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.200" end="00:21:00.510" style="s2">from the world nothing is more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.390" end="00:21:03.070" style="s2">than understanding that nobody has nukes</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.510" end="00:21:04.840" style="s2">and seeing how we&#39;re going to help each</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.070" end="00:21:06.070" style="s2">other and lift each other up to me is</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.840" end="00:21:07.390" style="s2">beautiful and the way we were able to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.070" end="00:21:14.740" style="s2">that and I think this is part of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.390" end="00:21:16.300" style="s2">and so I thank you for that - that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.740" end="00:21:18.840" style="s2">perfect that was like 30 seconds to go I</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:47.800" style="s2">love with one another to see who I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.730" end="00:21:51.430" style="s2">we&#39;re more connected and divided I can</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.800" end="00:21:53.770" style="s2">see the genius and amazingness in every</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.430" end="00:21:56.830" style="s2">single human being and we create the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.770" end="00:21:58.750" style="s2">tools that allow us to live that life</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.830" end="00:22:00.970" style="s2">when we have our needs met our food</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.750" end="00:22:02.800" style="s2">needs and our shelter needs and we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.970" end="00:22:04.150" style="s2">the tools to connect with real people</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.800" end="00:22:06.820" style="s2">and we have all of these amazing</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.150" end="00:22:08.140" style="s2">products that Remzi and Daniel and Lana</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.820" end="00:22:11.020" style="s2">and Nathaniel when they get to live</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.140" end="00:22:12.550" style="s2">their life when they get to have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.020" end="00:22:16.270" style="s2">space to help people in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.550" end="00:22:18.190" style="s2">they want to help people that is my idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.270" end="00:22:19.810" style="s2">of a beautiful future and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.190" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">absolutely possible because I can see</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.810" end="00:22:24.790" style="s2">how we do it and a big piece is this the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:26.410" style="s2">idea cafe that as we&#39;re able to come</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.790" end="00:22:28.330" style="s2">together this is a this is broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.410" end="00:22:30.790" style="s2">live on YouTube and hopefully it will</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.330" end="00:22:32.860" style="s2">grow but the idea is we&#39;re gonna create</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.790" end="00:22:36.010" style="s2">our own platform that isn&#39;t reliant on</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.860" end="00:22:38.440" style="s2">their algorithm that isn&#39;t reliant on on</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.010" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">their and I&#39;m just realizing now I did</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.440" end="00:22:40.930" style="s2">not start recording my I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:42.850" style="s2">start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.930" end="00:22:47.560" style="s2">but I do have a little clock in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.850" end="00:22:49.690" style="s2">corner that we have our own platform</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.560" end="00:22:51.850" style="s2">that anyone can show up to and have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.690" end="00:22:54.160" style="s2">conversation with real people around a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.850" end="00:22:55.480" style="s2">question it doesn&#39;t need to be broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.160" end="00:22:58.090" style="s2">to the world because I think it does</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.480" end="00:23:00.340" style="s2">make it a different forum I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.090" end="00:23:02.020" style="s2">realizing as I can see all the little</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.340" end="00:23:03.610" style="s2">pictures down below and people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.020" end="00:23:05.740" style="s2">nodding along that you all can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.610" end="00:23:08.050" style="s2">that and there is something disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.740" end="00:23:09.940" style="s2">in that but like there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.050" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a trade-off right now because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.940" end="00:23:12.820" style="s2">we&#39;re going live and because we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:14.860" style="s2">it in this format that some people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.820" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">might want to share aren&#39;t gonna feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.860" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">comfortable doing it this way and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:20.500" style="s2">not going to have that same human</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.700" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">connection that we are when we create</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.500" end="00:23:25.660" style="s2">our own platform but this is a space and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:28.330" style="s2">a way forward to get people together to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.660" end="00:23:30.040" style="s2">say what do we have in common what are</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.330" end="00:23:31.960" style="s2">our stories how do we find our</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.040" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">commonality even if we don&#39;t agree on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.960" end="00:23:37.510" style="s2">lot of the things that are dividing us</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.520" end="00:23:40.150" style="s2">in this world and so that is my</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.510" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">beautiful future and I thank you all for</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.150" end="00:23:43.900" style="s2">coming to helping create it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:45.130" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna add everybody back in I just</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.900" end="00:23:47.050" style="s2">want to mention Lana I think your</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.130" end="00:23:48.520" style="s2">bangles are I think you might have</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.050" end="00:23:51.810" style="s2">bracelets on that we&#39;re like right by</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.520" end="00:23:54.370" style="s2">your mic when you were talking so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.810" end="00:23:55.240" style="s2">we could do something about that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.370" end="00:23:59.080" style="s2">would be awesome</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.240" end="00:24:00.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you for choosing to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.080" end="00:24:02.020" style="s2">muted you can always choose to be muted</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.370" end="00:24:03.280" style="s2">or you can unmute yourselves I won&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.020" end="00:24:04.540" style="s2">what I did to Lana which we were both</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.280" end="00:24:07.300" style="s2">trying to mute and unmute at the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.540" end="00:24:10.390" style="s2">time ended up you know being a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.300" end="00:24:13.030" style="s2">so now I would like to invite we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.390" end="00:24:14.410" style="s2">about like five more minutes left the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.030" end="00:24:15.610" style="s2">idea is for this to be half an hour so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.410" end="00:24:17.560" style="s2">there could be another half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.610" end="00:24:18.760" style="s2">after and we can keep although if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.560" end="00:24:21.370" style="s2">wanted to go over a little bit I know</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.760" end="00:24:23.710" style="s2">Remzi has to get to oh yeah there you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.370" end="00:24:28.060" style="s2">are slip denied your back end has to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.710" end="00:24:31.630" style="s2">to a podcast interview at in a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.060" end="00:24:35.610" style="s2">bit but to share to share what we got</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.630" end="00:24:38.050" style="s2">from listening to each other and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.610" end="00:24:43.930" style="s2">what is in present in the moment right</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.050" end="00:24:45.280" style="s2">now one thing sublime for me and just in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.930" end="00:24:47.890" style="s2">this in listening to each of you because</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.280" end="00:24:49.630" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of wisdom and neat</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.890" end="00:24:52.390" style="s2">ideas and inspiration to them hearing</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.630" end="00:24:54.730" style="s2">that&#39;s their envision and to me one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.390" end="00:24:57.550" style="s2">the key parts of a beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.730" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">is that feeling of empowerment and for</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.550" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">people to have the space you know have</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:03.340" style="s2">enough of their Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:04.990" style="s2">needs met have shelter have food have</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.340" end="00:25:07.750" style="s2">the ability to figure out what is it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.990" end="00:25:09.910" style="s2">that that I see and that I can be giving</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.750" end="00:25:12.790" style="s2">to the world that&#39;s unique and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.910" end="00:25:14.860" style="s2">the piece that I have I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.790" end="00:25:17.080" style="s2">biggest tragically underutilized</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.860" end="00:25:19.420" style="s2">resource that we have is ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.080" end="00:25:22.170" style="s2">then we have millions of people with</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.420" end="00:25:26.200" style="s2">genius ideas and compassion and vision</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.170" end="00:25:28.300" style="s2">who are spending their time in jobs that</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.200" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">they don&#39;t like stressing out trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.300" end="00:25:33.429" style="s2">meet their basic needs and the level of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:35.290" style="s2">disconnection and antipathy that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.429" end="00:25:36.970" style="s2">sometimes get from that whereas if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.290" end="00:25:40.059" style="s2">able to just breathe and live and have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.970" end="00:25:41.860" style="s2">little bit of space all of these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.059" end="00:25:42.970" style="s2">of inspirations can come out so so</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.860" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a big piece for me is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.970" end="00:25:47.530" style="s2">shift our story as individuals and come</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:58.210" style="s2">to that place of empowerment and where</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.530" end="00:26:00.490" style="s2">we can connect with others who mmm thank</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.210" end="00:26:03.970" style="s2">you so much for creating this such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.490" end="00:26:06.340" style="s2">beautiful place and feeling seen and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.970" end="00:26:10.090" style="s2">heard and safe to express and to just</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.340" end="00:26:13.780" style="s2">you know share the ideas the thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.090" end="00:26:15.910" style="s2">and yeah I completely agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.780" end="00:26:18.910" style="s2">the way you describe the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.910" end="00:26:22.690" style="s2">future and what you want and what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.910" end="00:26:23.110" style="s2">are already creating it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.690" end="00:26:31.150" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.110" end="00:26:32.980" style="s2">thank you I chose to not become as</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.150" end="00:26:35.950" style="s2">passionate as you seen me before that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.980" end="00:26:37.720" style="s2">was that that was a personal choice I</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.950" end="00:26:41.710" style="s2">can do that if you&#39;d like but I chose</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.720" end="00:26:43.990" style="s2">not to because all this does matter to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.710" end="00:26:46.030" style="s2">me every every single thing that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.990" end="00:26:47.470" style="s2">here right now I&#39;m not running for</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.030" end="00:26:51.580" style="s2">public office because it&#39;s fun by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.470" end="00:26:54.550" style="s2">way people say people say things to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.580" end="00:26:57.900" style="s2">and about me that are first off untrue</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.550" end="00:27:02.020" style="s2">but also are incredibly negative and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.900" end="00:27:03.850" style="s2">even so having things like this where</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.020" end="00:27:05.140" style="s2">people say you know what these are our</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.850" end="00:27:07.420" style="s2">visions for the future and how we can we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.140" end="00:27:10.100" style="s2">bring this all together and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.420" end="00:27:13.490" style="s2">that each that each person is actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.100" end="00:27:14.690" style="s2">valued really helps me a lot and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.490" end="00:27:16.460" style="s2">kind of nice that I don&#39;t have that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.690" end="00:27:18.470" style="s2">don&#39;t have to say hey everybody should</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.460" end="00:27:26.270" style="s2">have access to things and not get yelled</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.470" end="00:27:28.280" style="s2">at so I think for me that too is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.270" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">most inspiring thing of all this is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.280" end="00:27:34.700" style="s2">so many of us have the desire and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:37.880" style="s2">vision of a more inclusive collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.700" end="00:27:40.490" style="s2">world and so it&#39;s it&#39;s refreshing to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.880" end="00:27:42.560" style="s2">know that we&#39;re not alone and that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.490" end="00:27:45.470" style="s2">majority that people actually want the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.560" end="00:27:51.410" style="s2">same thing that we do and so I find that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.470" end="00:27:53.960" style="s2">incredibly inspiring you know and I just</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.410" end="00:27:55.400" style="s2">want to say the final kudos for going</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.960" end="00:27:57.140" style="s2">into that realm of public office that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.400" end="00:27:58.220" style="s2">said that&#39;s a hard place to be and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.140" end="00:27:59.930" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.220" end="00:28:02.330" style="s2">seeking connection going into a place</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.930" end="00:28:04.670" style="s2">that is so about polarization and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.330" end="00:28:06.770" style="s2">looking at how can i how can I slice</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.670" end="00:28:09.560" style="s2">this person down using the most sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.770" end="00:28:10.370" style="s2">strong man arguments as possible and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.560" end="00:28:11.860" style="s2">think that&#39;s going to be another thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.370" end="00:28:14.450" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be really exciting watching</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.860" end="00:28:16.610" style="s2">change is how we deal with political</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.450" end="00:28:18.530" style="s2">discourse and how we get involved so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.610" end="00:28:20.390" style="s2">people don&#39;t simply get involved in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.530" end="00:28:23.330" style="s2">giant slug fest but ever election time</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.390" end="00:28:25.610" style="s2">comes but having a sense of what civic</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.330" end="00:28:28.040" style="s2">responsibilities means is being actively</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.610" end="00:28:30.530" style="s2">constantly engaged and how how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.040" end="00:28:32.030" style="s2">things locally in our in our communities</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.530" end="00:28:33.830" style="s2">in our society that make things better</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.030" end="00:28:36.350" style="s2">and engage with people of different</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.830" end="00:28:41.930" style="s2">viewpoints in a way that is humanized</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.350" end="00:28:45.410" style="s2">the corgis are barking in the background</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.930" end="00:28:49.930" style="s2">I apologize for that I I completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.410" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">agree with you and while I plan on on on</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.930" end="00:28:58.250" style="s2">replacing my opponent next next November</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:59.630" style="s2">I also have an incredible amount of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.250" end="00:29:00.790" style="s2">respect for anybody that&#39;s willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.630" end="00:29:03.020" style="s2">something like this and I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.790" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">attempted to reach out to him he&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.020" end="00:29:07.250" style="s2">responded to any of my requests to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:11.090" style="s2">actually sit down and talk to him but to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.250" end="00:29:12.470" style="s2">actually to do something like this to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.090" end="00:29:13.970" style="s2">where because all of us have a vision</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.470" end="00:29:15.140" style="s2">for the future regardless of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.970" end="00:29:16.430" style="s2">and that&#39;s the reason we do things like</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.140" end="00:29:20.060" style="s2">this well the reason we were in public</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.430" end="00:29:20.750" style="s2">office right and or whatever we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.060" end="00:29:23.240" style="s2">whatever venture</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.230" end="00:29:42.460" style="s2">got on to Austin it&#39;s not - it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.800" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">be a politician but rather to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.460" end="00:29:48.260" style="s2">person who is working for people and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:49.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve had people ask me what about money</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.260" end="00:29:50.600" style="s2">and things like that and people actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.340" end="00:29:52.010" style="s2">offered to give me money from businesses</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.600" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">and stuff like that and I turned them</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.010" end="00:30:01.240" style="s2">down because businesses aren&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:30:05.600" style="s2">and I working with people and seeing the</p>
