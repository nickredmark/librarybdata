<p begin="00:00:06.379" end="00:00:12.240" style="s2">Jordan it&#39;s great to to interview you</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">again I need you back in October last</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">year and then made I&#39;ve now made two</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">documentaries about you and a big focus</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">for rebel wisdom is kind of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">of the cultural moment and making sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">of your success and whatever it presents</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you remember but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:32.040" style="s2">very first question I asked you back in</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">October and the interview was firstly</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.040" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">what you make of your success so far and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">are you ready for it to continue because</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">I had I had a sense back then that what</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">your message represented was something</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">the culture desperately needed the sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">of and what that signifies to me is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:50.309" style="s2">kind of reintegration of a sacred did</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">you have any sense back then the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">exponential success that you were going</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:59.750" style="s2">to have between then and now well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">the most likely outcome at each of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.750" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">what would you say at each point where I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">might notice what&#39;s going on around me</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:11.130" style="s2">has been that this was stalled but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t stopping so I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.130" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">about that pretty much non-stop I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.560" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">say and I have some some solutions let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">say or some ideas that I didn&#39;t present</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:27.590" style="s2">in October so one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">realized is that part of what&#39;s pushing</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.590" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">part of what&#39;s accounting for this the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">popularity of my ideas is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">secondary consequence of a technological</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">revolution and I&#39;ve seen that more</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">clearly since October</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">partly because I can see the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">media dying at a faster and faster rate</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">and the alternative media expanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:59.430" style="s2">faster and faster so television radio</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">and the classic print media had shared</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.430" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">one thing in common which was a extreme</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:06.509" style="s2">restriction in bandwidth this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:10.670" style="s2">especially true of television because</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.509" end="00:02:13.160" style="s2">each minute of television given the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.670" end="00:02:16.550" style="s2">necessity to broadcast and the expense</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.160" end="00:02:19.160" style="s2">that was unbelievably expensive and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.550" end="00:02:19.940" style="s2">there just wasn&#39;t time to do anything on</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.160" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">television</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">there&#39;s no time and so if you had</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:28.550" style="s2">something important to say or even</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:31.490" style="s2">something unimportant for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.550" end="00:02:33.830" style="s2">most of the time it had to be compressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.490" end="00:02:35.510" style="s2">into something approximating 30 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.830" end="00:02:38.270" style="s2">which wouldn&#39;t even be your words it</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.510" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">would be a journalist common commenting</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.270" end="00:02:44.420" style="s2">on what you said and if you were really</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:46.070" style="s2">pushing the envelope maybe you&#39;d have 25</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.420" end="00:02:48.470" style="s2">minutes on a talk show that was devoted</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.070" end="00:02:52.760" style="s2">to your ideas but then even that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.470" end="00:02:55.150" style="s2">be highly scripted and so television</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.760" end="00:02:57.950" style="s2">made people look stupider than they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.150" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">even to the producers of television</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.950" end="00:03:06.850" style="s2">because of this narrow bandwidth the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:09.950" style="s2">rise of video online and audio as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.850" end="00:03:13.850" style="s2">has blown the bandwidth limitation out</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.950" end="00:03:17.600" style="s2">of our mass communication and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.850" end="00:03:20.780" style="s2">out that people are smarter with longer</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.600" end="00:03:23.270" style="s2">attention spans than we thought what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.780" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">happened with me was that for one reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.270" end="00:03:28.550" style="s2">or another I was an early adopter of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:30.920" style="s2">that technology and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.550" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">massive technological transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.920" end="00:03:37.130" style="s2">which is a Gutenberg revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:39.050" style="s2">provision of video and audio no barrier</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.130" end="00:03:41.750" style="s2">to production because it doesn&#39;t cost</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.050" end="00:03:43.670" style="s2">anything anyone can do it people can</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.750" end="00:03:45.500" style="s2">communicate with it you can cut up</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.670" end="00:03:47.390" style="s2">YouTube videos you can make your</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.500" end="00:03:49.970" style="s2">documentaries the entry point is easy</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.390" end="00:03:52.040" style="s2">audio podcasts and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.970" end="00:03:55.640" style="s2">which can be of indefinite length allow</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.040" end="00:03:58.520" style="s2">people to use found time to listen more</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.640" end="00:04:00.860" style="s2">people can listen than can read like all</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.520" end="00:04:03.230" style="s2">of these things add up to a massive</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.860" end="00:04:07.100" style="s2">technological revolution and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.230" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">upswell in technology that in part has</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.100" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">propelled what I&#39;ve been doing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.790" end="00:04:16.940" style="s2">tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu this mass audience and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">so that&#39;s been a relief to figure that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:21.260" style="s2">out because it depersonalized is it to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:23.300" style="s2">some degree right and so I used the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.260" end="00:04:25.760" style="s2">metaphor when I&#39;ve been asked about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:28.490" style="s2">before of being on a wave</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.760" end="00:04:30.530" style="s2">I&#39;m surfing on a giant wave but the wave</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.490" end="00:04:32.990" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that I&#39;ve done it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.530" end="00:04:36.020" style="s2">of this technological revolution so</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.990" end="00:04:37.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a relief to know that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.020" end="00:04:39.560" style="s2">quite convinced that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.460" end="00:04:43.250" style="s2">because there are other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.560" end="00:04:45.320" style="s2">occupying the same space essentially Joe</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.250" end="00:04:48.950" style="s2">Rogan is a very good example of that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.320" end="00:04:51.800" style="s2">the various commentators on on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.950" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">who&#39;ve become increasingly influential</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.800" end="00:04:56.420" style="s2">and powerful same thing driven by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:04:59.330" style="s2">technology they happen to be early</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.420" end="00:05:01.250" style="s2">adopters and so and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.330" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">secondary question which is well is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.250" end="00:05:06.260" style="s2">there anything specific in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:09.500" style="s2">to my content let&#39;s say and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.260" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">also that is a the case and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.500" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to do with reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:21.620" style="s2">effectiveness is to draw a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:24.230" style="s2">equation equivalence between the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.620" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">that&#39;s necessary to sustain you in life</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.230" end="00:05:30.980" style="s2">given its suffering and malevolence and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.820" end="00:05:33.140" style="s2">the necessity to adopt responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.980" end="00:05:36.230" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s something new about</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.140" end="00:05:38.630" style="s2">that I mean I don&#39;t know how new I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.230" end="00:05:40.820" style="s2">sure I am NOT the first person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.630" end="00:05:43.250" style="s2">discovered that but I think I&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.820" end="00:05:47.030" style="s2">reasonable job of pointing out to people</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.250" end="00:05:49.900" style="s2">that that the suffering that&#39;s intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.030" end="00:05:53.990" style="s2">to life in the absence of meaning is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.900" end="00:05:56.990" style="s2">tolerable it it it destroys and corrupts</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.990" end="00:05:59.630" style="s2">and that the proper pathway out of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.990" end="00:06:01.670" style="s2">isn&#39;t rights or happiness or entitlement</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.630" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">or or anything that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.670" end="00:06:08.930" style="s2">with with individual ease let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:11.300" style="s2">with the adoption of something</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:14.330" style="s2">approximating maximal responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.300" end="00:06:15.920" style="s2">people get that like it&#39;s it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.330" end="00:06:18.830" style="s2">hard to understand when it&#39;s laid out</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.920" end="00:06:20.690" style="s2">like that and lots of people especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.830" end="00:06:23.540" style="s2">young people especially people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.690" end="00:06:26.420" style="s2">young and also somewhat nihilistic in</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.540" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">their orientation perhaps because of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.420" end="00:06:32.870" style="s2">excess of intellectual criticism or they</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:35.420" style="s2">grab that immediately think oh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.870" end="00:06:37.250" style="s2">the missing piece I see it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.420" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">the antidote to this meaninglessness</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.250" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">this void that I&#39;m for</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:45.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t hedonism it&#39;s not right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:48.500" style="s2">impulsive pleasure it&#39;s none of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.590" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s responsibility it&#39;s like oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.500" end="00:06:54.020" style="s2">okay that everything snaps into place</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:56.990" style="s2">and so that&#39;s been I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.020" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">most essential part of the message to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.990" end="00:07:00.650" style="s2">the degree that what I&#39;m doing has an</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:02.300" style="s2">essential message that would be it and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.650" end="00:07:06.380" style="s2">do think that&#39;s what it counts for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.300" end="00:07:09.080" style="s2">large part of its impact and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.380" end="00:07:10.669" style="s2">mentioned Joe Rogan before and you and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.080" end="00:07:12.290" style="s2">here group together in this sort of new</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.669" end="00:07:15.380" style="s2">constellation of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.290" end="00:07:16.850" style="s2">web what do you see is the I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.380" end="00:07:18.590" style="s2">you make of your kind of inclusion in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.850" end="00:07:21.350" style="s2">this and what do you see is its role</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.590" end="00:07:25.419" style="s2">going forward in the culture well well</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.350" end="00:07:29.389" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like a herd of cats</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.419" end="00:07:32.720" style="s2">right because so I&#39;ve thought about well</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.389" end="00:07:34.460" style="s2">what what what unites us to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:36.889" style="s2">that there&#39;s an us because that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.460" end="00:07:40.580" style="s2">self-evident there&#39;s enough of an ask so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.889" end="00:07:42.650" style="s2">that the name emerged and it&#39;s stuck so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.580" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">so there&#39;s something in common because</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.650" end="00:07:47.539" style="s2">otherwise the name wouldn&#39;t have stuck</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:50.270" style="s2">right you can&#39;t name nothing it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.539" end="00:07:52.550" style="s2">work and I&#39;ve talked a fair bit about</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.270" end="00:07:54.950" style="s2">this with Dave Rubin because Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.550" end="00:07:58.039" style="s2">and I have been touring together right</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.950" end="00:08:02.180" style="s2">he opens my my discussions and adds a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.039" end="00:08:05.030" style="s2">nice comedic touch to them and so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.180" end="00:08:08.450" style="s2">do we have in common everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.030" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">group is an independent practitioner so</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.450" end="00:08:14.660" style="s2">an entrepreneur essentially with their</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:17.479" style="s2">own media enterprise that&#39;s autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.660" end="00:08:21.800" style="s2">none of us are serving any master except</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.479" end="00:08:24.139" style="s2">the audience so so and and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.800" end="00:08:26.599" style="s2">somewhat independent financially as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.139" end="00:08:30.349" style="s2">consequence of that and so that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.599" end="00:08:32.750" style="s2">beholden to no master all of us are</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.349" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">engaged in these long-form discussions</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.750" end="00:08:37.669" style="s2">right and one of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:39.529" style="s2">being engaged in a long-form discussion</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.669" end="00:08:41.450" style="s2">is that you can assume that your</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.529" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">intelligence that your audience is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.450" end="00:08:45.620" style="s2">intelligent and so that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:47.750" style="s2">that unites everybody in the group is we</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.620" end="00:08:49.850" style="s2">all assume that our audience is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.750" end="00:08:52.130" style="s2">intelligent but I think that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.850" end="00:08:54.200" style="s2">so much a consequence of any</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.130" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">particular moral virtue on our parts but</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.200" end="00:08:59.480" style="s2">an observation that the technology has</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:01.310" style="s2">made possible it&#39;s like oh when you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.480" end="00:09:02.600" style="s2">see this I would say particularly with</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.310" end="00:09:05.170" style="s2">Roman because in some sense he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.600" end="00:09:07.520" style="s2">trailblazer in this domain it&#39;s like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.170" end="00:09:09.650" style="s2">turns out my audience will listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.520" end="00:09:10.970" style="s2">three-hour discussion but he wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.650" end="00:09:13.610" style="s2">have been able to discover that without</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.970" end="00:09:16.400" style="s2">the technology right so now to his</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.610" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">credit he was smart enough to discover</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.400" end="00:09:21.140" style="s2">it and smart enough to notice it when he</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:22.910" style="s2">discovered it and so and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.140" end="00:09:24.500" style="s2">also characterizes the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.910" end="00:09:26.990" style="s2">people in this group it&#39;s like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.500" end="00:09:29.800" style="s2">at that the audience actually wants our</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.990" end="00:09:34.270" style="s2">listeners that say and viewers want</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.800" end="00:09:38.090" style="s2">detailed in-depth unscripted spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.270" end="00:09:39.830" style="s2">meaningful conversation and then really</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.090" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">are willing to go in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.830" end="00:09:45.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the risk-taking element like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:47.690" style="s2">can give an example of that so I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.050" end="00:09:51.890" style="s2">did for talks with Sam Harris who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.690" end="00:09:54.290" style="s2">often grouped into this group as well on</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.890" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">the relationship between science and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.290" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">religion say or facts and values that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:09:59.990" style="s2">another way of thinking about it with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:03.620" style="s2">bit of politics thrown in discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.990" end="00:10:05.960" style="s2">left/right differences and so on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.620" end="00:10:09.830" style="s2">the willingness to take the risk well I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.960" end="00:10:12.260" style="s2">had no idea when I met Sam in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.830" end="00:10:14.600" style="s2">which was where the first two of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.260" end="00:10:17.210" style="s2">four talks were held I&#39;d never met him</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.600" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">before we did a two podcast together one</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.210" end="00:10:22.010" style="s2">of which was very we got locked in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:24.770" style="s2">other one which was more productive I</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.010" end="00:10:29.710" style="s2">would say but I had no idea of he had I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.770" end="00:10:33.470" style="s2">could talk but we we were willing to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.710" end="00:10:36.890" style="s2">willing to I guess that&#39;s right agreed</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.470" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">to take the risk to see if we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.890" end="00:10:42.350" style="s2">in a public forum and and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">another thing that characterizes the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.350" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">people in that group is that they will</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:48.860" style="s2">take those sorts of risks if you go into</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">a television studio a classic television</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.860" end="00:10:53.750" style="s2">studio all the conversation is scripted</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:54.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually quite frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.750" end="00:10:56.840" style="s2">because you can&#39;t have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.860" end="00:10:59.950" style="s2">with the journalist because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.840" end="00:11:03.140" style="s2">journalist isn&#39;t there who&#39;s there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.950" end="00:11:05.510" style="s2">frontispiece for the organization and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.140" end="00:11:07.880" style="s2">the organization has scripted all there</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.510" end="00:11:09.890" style="s2">so it&#39;s not actually like talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.880" end="00:11:13.820" style="s2">person it&#39;s really like talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.890" end="00:11:16.550" style="s2">puppet so for better or for worse but in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:19.220" style="s2">these long unscripted long-form</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.550" end="00:11:22.820" style="s2">conversations then you can take the risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.220" end="00:11:24.830" style="s2">of having a conversation and that can go</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.820" end="00:11:27.260" style="s2">spectacularly well but it can also fail</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.830" end="00:11:30.170" style="s2">dismally so I would say those are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.260" end="00:11:33.830" style="s2">things that unite us to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.170" end="00:11:38.090" style="s2">the group exists I mean I met when I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.830" end="00:11:43.130" style="s2">in LA a week ago and about 7 of us got</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.090" end="00:11:44.930" style="s2">together for for dinner and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.130" end="00:11:48.350" style="s2">first time we we&#39;d met as anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.930" end="00:11:49.520" style="s2">approximating a group and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.350" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">was interesting to watch everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.520" end="00:11:53.300" style="s2">interact because as I said it really is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:55.310" style="s2">a herd of cats there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.300" end="00:11:57.590" style="s2">diversity of political opinion and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.310" end="00:12:00.950" style="s2">tremendous diversity of personality like</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.590" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">Eric Weinstein and Joe Rogan like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.950" end="00:12:07.100" style="s2">they&#39;re not even members of the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:12.140" style="s2">species in some ways you know so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.100" end="00:12:14.840" style="s2">a very fractious group but I think those</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.140" end="00:12:17.180" style="s2">things that I outlined are the elements</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.840" end="00:12:19.400" style="s2">that basically unite it there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.180" end="00:12:21.470" style="s2">something that I sense watching some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.400" end="00:12:24.410" style="s2">the discussions there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.470" end="00:12:27.070" style="s2">intellectual curiosity and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.410" end="00:12:29.540" style="s2">people thinking in public and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.070" end="00:12:30.890" style="s2">there&#39;s also a sense of maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.540" end="00:12:33.500" style="s2">potential for people to change their</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.890" end="00:12:34.760" style="s2">minds or to discover things during the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.500" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">conversation well that&#39;s partly the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.760" end="00:12:39.560" style="s2">appreciation of the intelligence of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:41.870" style="s2">audience it&#39;s like and I would say it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.560" end="00:12:44.060" style="s2">actually the manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.870" end="00:12:46.040" style="s2">process of thinking that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.060" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">important than the conclusions that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.040" end="00:12:50.450" style="s2">generated even in these discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.170" end="00:12:54.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having with Harris like we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.450" end="00:12:57.020" style="s2">trying to to argue out to different</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.950" end="00:13:00.290" style="s2">viewpoints because Harris believes that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.020" end="00:13:03.050" style="s2">values can be derived with with with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.290" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">unerring precision in some sense using</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.050" end="00:13:07.610" style="s2">the proper methodology from facts and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:09.230" style="s2">I believe that it&#39;s more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.610" end="00:13:11.180" style="s2">than that that there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.230" end="00:13:14.510" style="s2">intermediating structures and those are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.180" end="00:13:17.750" style="s2">really narrative and in their nature so</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.510" end="00:13:19.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a technical argument as well as</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.750" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">a variety of sub arguments of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.470" end="00:13:24.990" style="s2">the relative role of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:28.680" style="s2">religion and so forth but the outcome of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.990" end="00:13:30.600" style="s2">the debate about those issues is partly</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.680" end="00:13:33.990" style="s2">what people are coming to the talks to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.600" end="00:13:36.420" style="s2">see to to to determine what should the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.990" end="00:13:40.440" style="s2">conclusions be but a much larger part</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.420" end="00:13:42.900" style="s2">perhaps is to in to observe and engage</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.440" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">at least by proxy in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.900" end="00:13:47.910" style="s2">dialogue and that&#39;s more important</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:50.670" style="s2">because dialogue is the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.910" end="00:13:52.500" style="s2">complex problems are solved which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.670" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">what makes me a free speech advocate</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.500" end="00:13:58.050" style="s2">fundamentally well it&#39;s not an advocate</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:14:00.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like I realized that that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.050" end="00:14:03.390" style="s2">protection for free speech is protection</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.660" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">of the mechanism whereby complex social</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.390" end="00:14:09.270" style="s2">problems are solved and were were the</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.200" end="00:14:24.870" style="s2">conversation I think you&#39;ve now come to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.490" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">the end of your debate for sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.870" end="00:14:28.980" style="s2">and they said that you expressed a</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.980" end="00:14:33.000" style="s2">when Sam didn&#39;t grass some of the points</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.320" end="00:14:34.170" style="s2">that you were making or that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.000" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">fully appreciate that he&#39;d and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.170" end="00:14:39.000" style="s2">understood them I also think that Sam</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:41.160" style="s2">Harris in particular he&#39;s built a whole</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.160" end="00:14:47.310" style="s2">on this atheism position do you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.860" end="00:14:49.320" style="s2">that he can argue in good faith from</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.310" end="00:14:50.760" style="s2">that perspective could he turn around</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.320" end="00:14:53.220" style="s2">and say well actually no you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.760" end="00:14:55.380" style="s2">Jordan this atheism thing is a bit no I</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.220" end="00:14:56.940" style="s2">think he was I think he was I think he</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.380" end="00:14:59.310" style="s2">was conducting the discussion in good</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.940" end="00:15:01.740" style="s2">faith I actually think that what Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:05.070" style="s2">doing is a good faith project you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.740" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">he I think there&#39;s conceptual muddiness</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.070" end="00:15:13.170" style="s2">about it but you know his basic premise</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:16.040" style="s2">is that we could come to an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.170" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">that working to reduce unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.040" end="00:15:23.880" style="s2">misery and suffering is a universal good</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:25.620" style="s2">okay fair enough that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.880" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">reasonable proposition I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.620" end="00:15:29.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a proposition of fact and he claims</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.110" end="00:15:31.690" style="s2">that it is but that doesn&#39;t matter still</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.610" end="00:15:33.580" style="s2">it&#39;s fair enough then</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.690" end="00:15:36.010" style="s2">and then you know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.580" end="00:15:38.050" style="s2">proposition another proposition is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.010" end="00:15:42.310" style="s2">would be really good if our systems of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.050" end="00:15:43.930" style="s2">value weren&#39;t founded on error and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.310" end="00:15:46.270" style="s2">do we have that&#39;s not error well we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.930" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">facts we have objective facts I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.270" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">look at the technology look at what</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:51.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve done with our science it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:53.290" style="s2">you do want to underestimate the utility</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.610" end="00:15:55.150" style="s2">of objective facts so maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.290" end="00:15:57.010" style="s2">ground the value structure in the facts</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.150" end="00:16:01.270" style="s2">it&#39;s like well that would be good if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.010" end="00:16:03.460" style="s2">could do it so and and so and then his</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.270" end="00:16:05.290" style="s2">his ethic let&#39;s say is an amalgam of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.460" end="00:16:07.870" style="s2">those two propositions and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.290" end="00:16:09.220" style="s2">his project is honorable and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.870" end="00:16:12.520" style="s2">think he&#39;s committed to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.220" end="00:16:15.880" style="s2">he also rightly is concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.520" end="00:16:20.170" style="s2">dangers of the Fundamentalist dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.880" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">revealed truth and so is very skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.170" end="00:16:32.550" style="s2">about about the axiomatic claims of of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:32.550" style="s2">dogmatic religion yeah fair enough but</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.820" end="00:16:39.090" style="s2">his the mechanisms that he outlines to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.580" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">derive values from facts are</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.090" end="00:16:44.380" style="s2">insufficient in my estimation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:46.960" style="s2">think that his argument is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.380" end="00:16:50.260" style="s2">sophisticated even though I don&#39;t doubt</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.960" end="00:16:53.770" style="s2">it&#39;s I don&#39;t think that Sam is any less</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.260" end="00:16:56.770" style="s2">committed to an ethical good it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.770" end="00:17:01.810" style="s2">obvious to me that he is than I am you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.770" end="00:17:03.670" style="s2">know and he&#39;s argued and discussed fully</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.810" end="00:17:05.640" style="s2">in good faith as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.670" end="00:17:10.270" style="s2">you know with the with the odd error</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.640" end="00:17:12.580" style="s2">because no one is negotiating 100% all</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.270" end="00:17:15.130" style="s2">the time in good faith I mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.580" end="00:17:17.680" style="s2">standard that no one can can this can</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.130" end="00:17:19.570" style="s2">achieve but I think the discussions have</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.680" end="00:17:21.610" style="s2">been unbelievably productive and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.570" end="00:17:23.110" style="s2">we&#39;ll see that certainly the crowds are</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.610" end="00:17:24.700" style="s2">responding I don&#39;t think the crowds</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.110" end="00:17:27.010" style="s2">would have been engaged if Sam wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.700" end="00:17:30.580" style="s2">be wouldn&#39;t been discussing in good</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.010" end="00:17:32.530" style="s2">faith you know because the engagement is</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.580" end="00:17:34.750" style="s2">actually an indication that a good faith</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.530" end="00:17:37.420" style="s2">discussion is is occurring otherwise it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.750" end="00:17:38.770" style="s2">gets dull very very rapidly we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.420" end="00:17:41.500" style="s2">what happens when the videos are</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.770" end="00:17:43.620" style="s2">released and that&#39;ll be in August once</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.500" end="00:17:46.440" style="s2">there the sound is edited and all</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.620" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">that and and then people will have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.440" end="00:17:52.140" style="s2">public debate about how it how the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:54.840" style="s2">discussion proceeded I also think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.140" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">each discussion built on the previous</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.840" end="00:17:59.160" style="s2">one and that we both ended up I think we</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">both ended that more informed and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.160" end="00:18:03.720" style="s2">articulate then we started out so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:05.490" style="s2">a good that&#39;s a really good thing I</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.720" end="00:18:09.000" style="s2">certainly understand his arguments much</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.490" end="00:18:12.030" style="s2">better than I did well a year ago let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.000" end="00:18:14.010" style="s2">say and I&#39;ve heard Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.030" end="00:18:16.679" style="s2">described sort of the cultural moment as</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.010" end="00:18:18.059" style="s2">a kind of civil war within the left sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.679" end="00:18:20.520" style="s2">of extreme left and then the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.059" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">moderate soft left which are probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.520" end="00:18:27.030" style="s2">sort of the at least the dominating kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:28.470" style="s2">of paradigm in the media I I&#39;m I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.030" end="00:18:31.170" style="s2">a lot of progressive friends and what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.470" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">see happening recently maybe in the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.170" end="00:18:37.320" style="s2">couple of weeks is a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:40.350" style="s2">starting to grapple with your ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.320" end="00:18:42.350" style="s2">looking at lasting this question what</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.350" end="00:18:45.000" style="s2">can the left learn from jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.350" end="00:18:47.309" style="s2">which is which is a pretty new</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.000" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">development because i saw a lot of kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.309" end="00:18:54.410" style="s2">of reactivity to it before how can you</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:56.370" style="s2">personally contribute to that debate and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.410" end="00:18:57.929" style="s2">debate you&#39;re interesting oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.370" end="00:19:01.610" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.929" end="00:19:03.870" style="s2">no no doubt about it no doubt about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.610" end="00:19:07.260" style="s2">what one thing that i&#39;ve been doing in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.870" end="00:19:09.090" style="s2">my tour repeatedly when i talked about</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:14.250" style="s2">back it&#39;s a discussion of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:16.410" style="s2">and and their eternal nature right</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.250" end="00:19:21.059" style="s2">because my claim is is not my claim i</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.410" end="00:19:24.540" style="s2">think its mere fact that organisms that</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.670" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">is at least 300 million years that our</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.309" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">nervous systems have adapted to</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.450" end="00:20:34.360" style="s2">way more serious than mere capitalism</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.059" end="00:21:04.360" style="s2">because some people are better at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.470" end="00:21:06.280" style="s2">implementation than others so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.360" end="00:21:08.620" style="s2">hierarchy of competence and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.280" end="00:21:11.530" style="s2">a hierarchy of distribution of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.620" end="00:21:13.450" style="s2">Spoils and so and in both of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.530" end="00:21:15.909" style="s2">hierarchies you get a disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.450" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">clumping of resources at the top and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.909" end="00:21:20.620" style="s2">dispossession at the bottom in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:24.970" style="s2">nature of hierarchies so what&#39;s the left</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.620" end="00:21:27.490" style="s2">for the left is to remind those who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.970" end="00:21:31.270" style="s2">benefiting from the hierarchies that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.490" end="00:21:33.820" style="s2">hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.270" end="00:21:36.940" style="s2">is the clumping of people at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.820" end="00:21:40.059" style="s2">and that that&#39;s an eternal cost and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.940" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">not trivial and so that&#39;s what the left</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.059" end="00:21:44.740" style="s2">should be properly focused on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:46.510" style="s2">should be providing the voice of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.740" end="00:21:50.860" style="s2">who are dispossessed by hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.510" end="00:21:52.870" style="s2">the right should be saying yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.860" end="00:21:55.390" style="s2">damn hierarchies are necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.870" end="00:21:58.539" style="s2">they&#39;re not only necessary but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.390" end="00:22:02.169" style="s2">also productive than the left says yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.539" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">but they tilt towards tyranny and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.169" end="00:22:06.419" style="s2">can be occupied inappropriately by</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:08.530" style="s2">people who are playing games of power</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.419" end="00:22:10.659" style="s2">fair enough the right has to take that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.530" end="00:22:13.989" style="s2">into account the hierarchy can</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.659" end="00:22:15.580" style="s2">rigidify and is likely to do that and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.989" end="00:22:17.649" style="s2">can be taken over by people who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.580" end="00:22:20.979" style="s2">corrupt and that&#39;s likely to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.649" end="00:22:23.139" style="s2">so but but it&#39;s okay because the dialog</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.979" end="00:22:24.700" style="s2">could work out the the right could say</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.139" end="00:22:26.289" style="s2">well yeah we need the damn hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.700" end="00:22:29.830" style="s2">and they need to be but wrists and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.289" end="00:22:32.169" style="s2">left can say yes but they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.830" end="00:22:34.299" style="s2">maintained properly so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.169" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">deteriorate and degenerate and and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.299" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s ancient</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:39.479" style="s2">wisdom I think the ancient Egyptians had</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:43.450" style="s2">figured that out in their symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.479" end="00:22:44.649" style="s2">representations so now when the left</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.450" end="00:22:46.749" style="s2">goes too far</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.649" end="00:22:48.729" style="s2">it does something like say well how</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.749" end="00:22:52.749" style="s2">about no hierarchies it&#39;s like no how</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.729" end="00:22:54.580" style="s2">about not wrong because all that happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.749" end="00:22:56.229" style="s2">if you flatten one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.580" end="00:22:57.789" style="s2">happens if you flatten out the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.229" end="00:23:00.489" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t even organize your</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.789" end="00:23:02.679" style="s2">perceptions you can&#39;t perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.489" end="00:23:05.559" style="s2">without looking at the world through a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.679" end="00:23:07.210" style="s2">hierarchy of value and if because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.559" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">can&#39;t perceive the world unless you make</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.210" end="00:23:10.239" style="s2">one thing more important than all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:12.489" style="s2">other things because you don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.239" end="00:23:13.720" style="s2">what to look at and if one thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.489" end="00:23:15.580" style="s2">more important than all the other things</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.720" end="00:23:16.809" style="s2">then you have nothing to aim at if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.580" end="00:23:19.029" style="s2">have nothing to aim at then you have no</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.809" end="00:23:21.039" style="s2">meaning in your life so the left can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.029" end="00:23:23.619" style="s2">just demolish the hierarchies in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.039" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">name of some equality of outcome let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.619" end="00:23:28.570" style="s2">say because you blow out the future you</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:30.279" style="s2">leave people aimless and you destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.570" end="00:23:32.019" style="s2">the very institutions that allow people</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.279" end="00:23:35.229" style="s2">to make competent progress in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.019" end="00:23:39.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not an acceptable outcome so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.229" end="00:23:42.489" style="s2">have to we have to agree to live with</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.159" end="00:23:44.649" style="s2">the tension necessity for hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.489" end="00:23:48.039" style="s2">the proclivity for them to pathologize</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.649" end="00:23:49.809" style="s2">and the the necessary voice of the left</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.039" end="00:23:53.559" style="s2">and speaking for thee for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.809" end="00:23:55.119" style="s2">dispossessed so and I mean I&#39;ve as far</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.559" end="00:23:57.700" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned I&#39;ve said something</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.119" end="00:24:00.220" style="s2">approximating that through my entire</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.700" end="00:24:02.289" style="s2">career and so the fact that the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.220" end="00:24:06.309" style="s2">wingers have been irritated at me is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.289" end="00:24:08.470" style="s2">well in some sense that&#39;s an inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.309" end="00:24:12.399" style="s2">consequence of me taking on the radical</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.470" end="00:24:16.119" style="s2">left wingers but it&#39;s also the refusal</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.399" end="00:24:19.779" style="s2">by the moderate left to deal with their</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.119" end="00:24:21.849" style="s2">internal problems and the sticking point</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.779" end="00:24:23.179" style="s2">that I hear a lot from my sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.849" end="00:24:25.009" style="s2">progressive friends is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.179" end="00:24:26.840" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of primary focus is on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.009" end="00:24:28.879" style="s2">individual yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.840" end="00:24:31.519" style="s2">bad for them because the primary should</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.879" end="00:24:34.789" style="s2">be you know I can agree with that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.519" end="00:24:36.620" style="s2">what I the the paradox that they would</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.789" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">say it&#39;s like okay focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.620" end="00:24:41.419" style="s2">individual but you have to accept that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:43.490" style="s2">there are some situations that are much</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.419" end="00:24:45.620" style="s2">more conducive to an individual thriving</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.490" end="00:24:47.690" style="s2">than other situations so their focus on</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.620" end="00:24:49.309" style="s2">structural inequality you&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.690" end="00:24:51.080" style="s2">the individual is there not some</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.309" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">interplay between most definitely well</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.080" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">obviously because people do have group</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:57.889" style="s2">identities the question is whether</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:25:00.019" style="s2">whether the group or the individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.889" end="00:25:02.029" style="s2">identity should be paramount and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.019" end="00:25:05.480" style="s2">left distance the radical leftist answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.029" end="00:25:07.009" style="s2">is well there is the look it&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.480" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">that&#39;s failing to take into account</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.009" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">those two levels of analysis it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:13.730" style="s2">bloody radical leftist because for them</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:16.999" style="s2">it&#39;s the collective and that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.730" end="00:25:19.789" style="s2">so it&#39;s obvious as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.999" end="00:25:21.529" style="s2">that people have their individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.789" end="00:25:23.570" style="s2">then behind that they have their they</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.529" end="00:25:25.399" style="s2">have their group like multiple group</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.570" end="00:25:27.379" style="s2">identities which is also a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.399" end="00:25:28.789" style="s2">but also poverty or any of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.379" end="00:25:30.169" style="s2">situations that make it much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.789" end="00:25:32.360" style="s2">difficult for people to self actualize</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.169" end="00:25:34.190" style="s2">well what I think they&#39;d argue is they</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.360" end="00:25:35.960" style="s2">don&#39;t hear you talk about that very much</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.190" end="00:25:37.759" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t first of all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.960" end="00:25:39.470" style="s2">self-evident like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.759" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t accept Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.470" end="00:25:43.190" style="s2">needs I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:44.269" style="s2">more difficult for people who are poor</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.190" end="00:25:46.970" style="s2">to self-actualize</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.269" end="00:25:48.470" style="s2">sorry I don&#39;t buy that he&#39;s because what</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.970" end="00:25:50.659" style="s2">that would mean think about what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.470" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">would mean that would mean that the rich</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.659" end="00:25:55.340" style="s2">are morally superior that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:57.019" style="s2">means because they have all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.340" end="00:25:59.570" style="s2">opportunities to self actualize so</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.019" end="00:26:00.889" style="s2">obviously if the material conditions are</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.570" end="00:26:03.259" style="s2">the prerequisite for self-actualization</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.889" end="00:26:05.179" style="s2">then the rich are morally superior to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.259" end="00:26:07.639" style="s2">the poor is that really an argument we</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.179" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">want to make and then in fact I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.639" end="00:26:11.809" style="s2">think that that&#39;s even even vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:14.059" style="s2">reasonable because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.809" end="00:26:15.110" style="s2">that does help build character is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.059" end="00:26:19.669" style="s2">privation</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.110" end="00:26:21.740" style="s2">now obviously starving to death is an an</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.669" end="00:26:26.090" style="s2">excess of privation</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.740" end="00:26:28.580" style="s2">so there are limit conditions but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.090" end="00:26:30.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a leftist trope that the provision</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.580" end="00:26:32.690" style="s2">of additional material resources will</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.679" end="00:26:33.470" style="s2">produce ethically superior human beings</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.690" end="00:26:35.059" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.470" end="00:26:37.249" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.059" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">and in fact sometimes quite the contrary</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.249" end="00:26:45.080" style="s2">so so so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:47.210" style="s2">that argument in the least I also think</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.080" end="00:26:49.909" style="s2">that under most circumstances in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.210" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">accepting those of exceptional privation</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.909" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">and even perhaps under those conditions</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">in most is in most cases your best bet</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:01.850" style="s2">to move people forward is to concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:03.740" style="s2">on the development of their individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.850" end="00:27:06.139" style="s2">character and their individual their</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.309" end="00:28:35.869" style="s2">of very spiritually aware and I i sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.369" end="00:28:37.399" style="s2">a kind of implicit message in what</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.610" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">materialism is a deadening doctrine I</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.860" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">mean you look at the opioid crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:48.560" style="s2">America you look at a lot of these if</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:50.540" style="s2">poverty is seen as a more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.560" end="00:28:52.310" style="s2">also also as a sort of spiritual crisis</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.540" end="00:28:56.090" style="s2">or a spot of crisis of the soul as much</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.310" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">as anything else is it mostly that like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.090" end="00:29:01.820" style="s2">it&#39;d be a lovely ring if if poverty was</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:05.060" style="s2">caused by lack of money mmm we could fix</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.820" end="00:29:06.590" style="s2">it really easily there but my point I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.060" end="00:29:08.270" style="s2">think is to say that if if you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.590" end="00:29:09.620" style="s2">framing your message in that way I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.270" end="00:29:10.070" style="s2">there would be a lot of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.620" end="00:29:12.680" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.070" end="00:29:14.660" style="s2">who&#39;d be receptive to that message sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.680" end="00:29:18.110" style="s2">of that that actually there is a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.660" end="00:29:19.820" style="s2">of that the crisis of already call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.110" end="00:29:22.220" style="s2">like world view has real consequences</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.820" end="00:29:23.450" style="s2">and a lot of poverty we&#39;re seeing in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.220" end="00:29:25.630" style="s2">world is to do with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.450" end="00:29:29.270" style="s2">materialist worldview that has become</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.630" end="00:29:30.530" style="s2">become corrupt or at least kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.270" end="00:29:32.420" style="s2">stripped all of the meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.530" end="00:29:35.260" style="s2">oh yeah well that&#39;s a good point well</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.420" end="00:29:38.810" style="s2">right well I mean I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.260" end="00:29:41.420" style="s2">materialism materialist hedonism is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.810" end="00:29:44.120" style="s2">sufficient solution now it&#39;s a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.420" end="00:29:47.510" style="s2">complicated than that because I do think</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.120" end="00:29:50.630" style="s2">that functional democratic systems are</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.510" end="00:29:53.210" style="s2">actually pretty good at reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.630" end="00:29:56.810" style="s2">hedonism like I&#39;m pretty happy that our</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.210" end="00:29:58.580" style="s2">system produces a variety of toothpastes</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.810" end="00:30:00.680" style="s2">and a variety of toilet papers and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.580" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">variety of sanitary napkins all of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.680" end="00:30:05.720" style="s2">things that that are basically oriented</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:07.790" style="s2">towards what would you call them</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.720" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">individual creature comforts there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.790" end="00:30:13.250" style="s2">something about that that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:16.040" style="s2">merciful and properly egalitarian and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.250" end="00:30:18.590" style="s2">a certain degree of material hedonism is</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.040" end="00:30:22.850" style="s2">a good thing right because it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.590" end="00:30:26.330" style="s2">that people can have their basic needs</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.850" end="00:30:29.030" style="s2">taken care of in a dignified manner but</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.330" end="00:30:30.680" style="s2">as a as a ultimate solution to the</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.680" end="00:30:37.310" style="s2">is again why I don&#39;t really like Abraham</p>

<p begin="00:31:22.170" end="00:31:27.060" style="s2">because generally they construe the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.790" end="00:31:29.940" style="s2">individual as either the oppressor or</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.770" end="00:31:50.970" style="s2">oppressors and that&#39;s actually when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.540" end="00:31:53.370" style="s2">been looking at what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.970" end="00:31:57.510" style="s2">aftermath of the Russian Revolution that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.370" end="00:31:59.700" style="s2">was the bloody error so to speak because</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.510" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">you could take virtually ever any</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.700" end="00:32:05.100" style="s2">individual and you could find out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.260" style="s2">like if there&#39;s one dimension of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.100" end="00:32:09.720" style="s2">identity that makes you an oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.260" end="00:32:12.600" style="s2">that trumps all the elements of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.720" end="00:32:14.070" style="s2">identity where you&#39;re a victim and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.600" end="00:32:15.630" style="s2">problem with that is there is one</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.070" end="00:32:18.330" style="s2">element of your identity where you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.630" end="00:32:20.670" style="s2">oppressor and so that&#39;s sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.330" end="00:32:21.240" style="s2">justification to throw you in with the</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.290" end="00:32:28.710" style="s2">happened in the aftermath while not only</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.090" end="00:32:31.530" style="s2">of the Russian Revolution but all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.710" end="00:32:34.140" style="s2">these radical leftist revolutions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.530" end="00:32:36.180" style="s2">like well if you&#39;re a socialist while</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.140" end="00:32:37.680" style="s2">you&#39;re not sufficiently pure from a</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.100" end="00:32:54.360" style="s2">and on and on and on there wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.530" end="00:33:03.900" style="s2">us are in fact oppressors and oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.380" end="00:33:08.730" style="s2">every single person shares both of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.900" end="00:33:10.230" style="s2">things in common so um got a couple of</p>
