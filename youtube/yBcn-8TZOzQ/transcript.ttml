<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.560" end="00:00:24.230" style="s2">Tyson Wagner you had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.360" end="00:00:27.050" style="s2">queueing on yes thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.230" end="00:00:28.460" style="s2">q and on has this in my personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.050" end="00:00:31.160" style="s2">experience what I see in my community</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.460" end="00:00:34.880" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of captivating almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.160" end="00:00:36.050" style="s2">seductive sensational thing going on in</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.880" end="00:00:38.150" style="s2">the way it captures people&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.050" end="00:00:42.110" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering like what can we learn</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.150" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">about good distributed collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.110" end="00:00:47.930" style="s2">intelligence from q and on and then what</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:51.160" style="s2">should we be most cautious of when</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.930" end="00:00:55.720" style="s2">looking at that and learning from that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.160" end="00:00:55.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:00.600" style="s2">by the way a bold question because as</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">you know even I think using the letter Q</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.600" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">these days tended to get you thrown in</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">jail so let&#39;s see let&#39;s think about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">so first off let&#39;s recognize that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">think the answer to the first part is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:12.690" style="s2">lot I think it&#39;s naive beyond</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:14.700" style="s2">comprehension to not recognize it that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.690" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">was a very powerful valuable experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.700" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">from which we can learn a lot so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">are the some of the things that showed</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">up if you think about it and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">watching it very closely for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:27.479" style="s2">so some of the things that showed up I</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:29.789" style="s2">would say are like cardinal virtues it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.479" end="00:01:31.350" style="s2">a deep stuff that frankly has been part</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.789" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">of cold any culture that&#39;s worth of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:39.770" style="s2">the phrase is like where we go one we go</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">all notions like own your mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.770" end="00:01:44.580" style="s2">notions like take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">actually digging take personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.580" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">responsibility for perceiving reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">think bigger don&#39;t be trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">existing ideological frameworks of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">isn&#39;t what is not be aware the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">this information and disinformation is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:01:59.429" style="s2">everywhere so don&#39;t stick to any</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:02.119" style="s2">particular point of view and assume that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.429" end="00:02:02.119" style="s2">that is authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">hope community connecting with each</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">other helping each other now this like</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">you know in some sense it isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">complicated just to take a look at at</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:17.310" style="s2">the mythopoetic archetypes of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:20.069" style="s2">virtue and heroism and wholesomeness</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.310" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">have always looked like and do that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.069" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">to the degree to which the Q community</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:27.209" style="s2">found that and upregulated that that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">the strong positive virtues that are in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.209" end="00:02:30.630" style="s2">fact in that community all right let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:31.560" style="s2">go to the opposite direction it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.630" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">because it seems to hold both</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.560" end="00:02:38.100" style="s2">simultaneously which is kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:40.950" style="s2">interesting thing well there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.100" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">mania well there&#39;s a certain manic</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.950" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">psychotic Sensibility a we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">psychotic age and we live in a psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">age because we all have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:59.170" style="s2">interact with far more</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:03:01.450" style="s2">information about reality then a our</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.170" end="00:03:03.430" style="s2">minds can handle and far less</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.450" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">information about reality than be</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.430" end="00:03:08.230" style="s2">actually tells us much about reality so</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.900" style="s2">in an environment we can tell really</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.230" end="00:03:12.700" style="s2">awesome stories we can weave together</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.900" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">narratives that sort of hold the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.700" end="00:03:15.730" style="s2">information that we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:17.680" style="s2">gather and hold into something like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.730" end="00:03:19.480" style="s2">coherent story and then we try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.680" end="00:03:20.500" style="s2">fact-check that by actually doing more</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.480" end="00:03:21.640" style="s2">information this is what I think where</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.500" end="00:03:23.799" style="s2">the acute phenomena has is one of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.640" end="00:03:26.200" style="s2">biggest gaps is that it&#39;s so bound to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.799" end="00:03:27.819" style="s2">the virtual and it&#39;s so capable I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.200" end="00:03:30.160" style="s2">been researching things at the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.819" end="00:03:32.170" style="s2">but then tries to draw conjectures on</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.160" end="00:03:34.120" style="s2">the basis inference and hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.170" end="00:03:35.410" style="s2">models of nature and and models about</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.410" end="00:03:40.810" style="s2">structures of reality are so if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.049" end="00:03:42.160" style="s2">think that I don&#39;t know let&#39;s go with</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.810" end="00:03:43.540" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.160" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">you think there&#39;s an organization called</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.540" end="00:03:48.490" style="s2">Rizvi 2 verse which is tied to the Saudi</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:51.520" style="s2">royal family and they have certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.490" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">capacities and agendas then you can use</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.520" end="00:03:56.290" style="s2">that assumption complex about which you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:58.180" style="s2">have no in reality to explain a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.290" end="00:03:59.560" style="s2">large number of phenomena now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.180" end="00:04:01.270" style="s2">gonna get a whole bunch of anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.560" end="00:04:02.380" style="s2">phenomena around that but you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.270" end="00:04:03.670" style="s2">pretend to ignore the anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.380" end="00:04:04.930" style="s2">phenomena be really happy about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.670" end="00:04:07.390" style="s2">thing that&#39;s inside your explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.930" end="00:04:09.670" style="s2">framework which is you say the key</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.390" end="00:04:12.940" style="s2">phenomenon gives us bas relief on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.670" end="00:04:16.150" style="s2">weakness of the paradigmatic mind . it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.940" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">tended to be psychotic and manic and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.150" end="00:04:21.090" style="s2">be self was the true bias towards its</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:25.290" style="s2">own self referentiality</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.090" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">and of course we also seen a tendency a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.290" end="00:04:32.100" style="s2">strong tendency although not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">a overwhelming tendency to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.100" end="00:04:37.770" style="s2">exact opposite of responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">externalize to hope that someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.770" end="00:04:43.229" style="s2">in charge and will in fact take care of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:44.900" style="s2">us and I believe that is also</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.229" end="00:04:47.490" style="s2">unfortunate at the end of the day false</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.900" end="00:04:48.449" style="s2">which is to say only this to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.490" end="00:04:49.949" style="s2">which there are people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.449" end="00:04:51.449" style="s2">positions of power authority</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.949" end="00:04:52.260" style="s2">responsibility who have our best</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.449" end="00:04:55.139" style="s2">interest in mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.260" end="00:04:57.450" style="s2">great awesome if we take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.139" end="00:04:59.639" style="s2">for ourselves with complete integrity</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.450" end="00:05:01.139" style="s2">then their interest in our interests</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.639" end="00:05:02.070" style="s2">would be completely aligned so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.139" end="00:05:03.900" style="s2">need to worry about whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.070" end="00:05:05.310" style="s2">there or not but to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.900" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">we alienate ourselves from our own</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.310" end="00:05:08.450" style="s2">agency just sort of step back and really</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:11.310" style="s2">hope they&#39;re doing a good job and become</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.450" end="00:05:12.810" style="s2">cheerleaders or fans in a sporting event</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.310" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">and they&#39;re the team on the field and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.810" end="00:05:17.630" style="s2">we&#39;re the guys the butts in the seats</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:17.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve done exactly the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.630" end="00:05:22.850" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
