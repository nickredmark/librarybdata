<p begin="00:00:25.530" end="00:00:28.170" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.030" end="00:00:30.390" style="s2">meaning in life but I think the best</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.170" end="00:00:34.099" style="s2">discussion of it is by Susan wolf in her</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.390" end="00:00:34.099" style="s2">book meaning in life and why it matters</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.910" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">right and she she boils it down to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">very interest she goes through lots of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">things and she gives a lot of argument</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">how it&#39;s not reducible to morality how</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:48.059" style="s2">it&#39;s not reducible to sort of material</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">success I invite you to read those I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.059" end="00:00:52.290" style="s2">can&#39;t go I don&#39;t have time to go through</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.170" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">those right now right and she says it</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.290" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">comes down to what initially what people</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:00:57.210" style="s2">say they want to be connected to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">something bigger than themselves but</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.210" end="00:01:00.839" style="s2">then she says that&#39;s just a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you know if I chained you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.839" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">to a mountain you&#39;re happy right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">a metaphor here she says what it is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:11.550" style="s2">we want to be right creatively</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:16.280" style="s2">participating in something that has a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.550" end="00:01:16.280" style="s2">value independent of our valuing of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.850" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">she has a formula for that she says we</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">want subjective attraction to meet</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:29.550" style="s2">objective attractiveness and then she</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">hits a naturalistic roadblock and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.550" end="00:01:34.770" style="s2">book sort of goes a little because she</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:36.530" style="s2">says the problem is there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.770" end="00:01:40.640" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.530" end="00:01:45.150" style="s2">things don&#39;t intrinsically have a value</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">things don&#39;t objectively have a value so</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.150" end="00:01:48.870" style="s2">what are we gonna do and she done she</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:50.550" style="s2">she considers one answer that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.870" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">have well what we do is we value what</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.550" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">other people value and she says that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:56.550" style="s2">not quite right you know you&#39;ve got bill</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">he knows that lots of people care about</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.550" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">the maple leaves so he devotes his whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:02.130" style="s2">life to you know thinking and talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:05.750" style="s2">about the maple leafs we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.130" end="00:02:05.750" style="s2">convinced bill&#39;s leading a good life</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.710" end="00:02:11.519" style="s2">right and that&#39;s where she sort of stops</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.489" style="s2">I want to try and go a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.519" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">farther right I want to try and go a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.489" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">little bit further and say what we want</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:21.720" style="s2">is we want to be connected to something</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">that we find profound and that we take</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.720" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">very seriously and that something and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:28.370" style="s2">that something towards which we can have</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:28.370" style="s2">reverence</p>
