<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:29.360" style="s2">really deep question</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">for me it&#39;s kind of like i i see this</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.360" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">whole process of writing this book</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">and the ongoing trials</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">as almost like the third act of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">sexual existence</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">in my in the first act of my sexual</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">existence i felt as if</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:48.799" style="s2">my sexuality was being regulated by</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">social categories which weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.799" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">determined by</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">me so for example i didn&#39;t determine the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">categories of boyfriend or girlfriend or</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">the normative patterns</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">that go into enacting those those forms</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">then in this and when i was doing that i</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">felt like</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">i was kind of like more robotic</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">if you like i was i was kind of acting</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">as i&#39;m supposed to act according to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">certain social</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">norm then in the sort of second act of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">i became very individual with my</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">and kind of detaching my sexuality from</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">what other people think or what other</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">say just to sort of figure out what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">how i connect to my sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">and now with this sex masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">god trialogs</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">the way i see this as the third act is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">i&#39;m in a mature place with myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">and i fi i&#39;m basically trying to connect</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">with other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">who are open to the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">identity and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">as a kind of networked phenomenon if</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:04.759" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">where identities escape the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.759" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">categorization but at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">not an individual experience it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">collective experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s an ongoing process for</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">me personally and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">really still you know early days i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">i can i can jump in here and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">pass to you daniel</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">whole transformative part of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">uh conversation because i just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">that in my pre-phase that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">this whole book was like symbolized by</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">the aurobus</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">the the snake that eats its tail because</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">on one hand we were talking about sex</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">that is actually something very</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">transformative itself</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">it has like the archetype of the snake</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">something that shapes</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">its old skin away and on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">the force of knife and when it eats its</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">tail</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">it&#39;s because you make this full circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:22.879" style="s2">which is also</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">on on on the cover of the book you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">which is uh leaned on on the send circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">and the gap in between so caden</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:32.640" style="s2">we also have a lot of conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">the gap in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.640" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">whole circle but um actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">this kind of transformative reflective</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">dialogues that we have been drawn into</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">had real impact on on the personal life</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">so i want me to break up you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">changing job and so on one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">crucial things that that really stayed</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">kind of or that really um</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">were perpetually going on in in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">phase was actually the last chapter</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">where we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">death and love so what makes you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">sure about what you&#39;re doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">and this deep questioning about</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">sexuality what</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">moves you what is ethically on what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">and how you proceed to gain something</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">meaningful out of your life and in your</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">and how you can measure yourself on</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">on your right path or not by asking</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">do you love it and would you do it if</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">you would die tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;s kind of like i became</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">more radical in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s like the biggest change to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">really more radical and really enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">the the free fall the freefall that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">if you want to jump from somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">if you are in love</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">and you just fall you know and you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">just take the courage to do it that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">became more courage</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">like that became more radical</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">yeah wonderful that&#39;s really good when</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">about the space in the center of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">circle i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">um remembering a conversation about how</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">someone was mentioning that when they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">look at stars they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">typically not really looking at a star</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">if they do long enough they kind of lose</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">sight of it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">they get they look at the space between</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">the stars and that&#39;s also how the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">the shapes and the stories and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">figures come together is through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">space in between all the stars</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">and i was being brought back to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">i&#39;m we&#39;ve been having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.279" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">conversations here at the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">and about all kinds of different things</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">what i really appreciate about it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of an embodiment of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">and holding many different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">which is something i think you guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">strive to do in the book is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">speak about all a lot of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:12.839" style="s2">that people</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">relate to sexuality gender and these</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.839" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">polarities</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">and with all these conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">were happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">and are in is here who&#39;s been doing um a</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">session around</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">metamodern masculinity a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">are involved in kind of having these</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">conversations um themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">and then our central focus i think no</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">matter what we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">around building communitas like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">connecting with one another</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">relating in a deeper more rich and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">and so having these conversations what</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">which at times</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">seem quite um challenging</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">and by being honest as as you are and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">and in my experience with others by</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">being honest it can allow</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">some chaos and confusion and ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">in to the conversations and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">but you you do so in between the three</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">of you quite artfully and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">and masterfully being articulating your</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">personal experiences and id</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">and these ideas and asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">that might um for some be</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">controversial or off limits or taboo not</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">to ask so i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">i&#39;m curious what have been some guiding</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">principles for you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">in how to have these conversations how</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">with openness and to invite openness in</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">others um with</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">just each other the three of you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">maybe with</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">other people as well um yeah guiding</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">for having these these</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">dialogues around things that might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">taboo</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">in a generative and productive way</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">i think i think one of the crucial</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.639" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">notions at least for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">that has it&#39;s been a huge process of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">discovery</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">which is always ongoing which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">to be aware of the way in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">unconsciously identifying</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">yourself with certain ideas so</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">if you&#39;re unconsciously identifying</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">yourself with certain ideas i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:13.519" style="s2">if someone critiques or disagrees with</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">you can sort of take it too personally</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">and then it sort of becomes it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">emotionally charged and you lose</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">you lose sight of what is really being</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">or even what the disagreement is about</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">so you know i think one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">moves is this ability to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">your intellect</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">serves the way in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">unconsciously identifying</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">and for me you know i like in the past i</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">would unconsciously identify</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">too much as a certain type of academic</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">and i would reify my identity around</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">that too much</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">and i think releasing myself from that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">gives me the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">the freedom to basically interact with</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">anyone about</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">almost anything if i&#39;m not too much</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">clinging to any one idea as too much</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">identified with myself then the second</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">is to be aware that the very</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">form of the discourse like the very form</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">of the discursive arena</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">changes the nature of what can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">discussed so one of the biggest things</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">is that when i was in academia i was in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">a very interdisciplinary environment</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:34.880" style="s2">that where in principle you could talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">about anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">but i found that what was implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">the academic structure was a type of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:45.600" style="s2">modality of professorship where</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">the discourse was shaped all around that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">one professor&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">so in reality we couldn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">anything we could only talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">accepted by that professor so in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">even though that an interdisciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">environment i felt personally</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">that topics of sexuality topics of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">masculinity and topics of religion</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">were off were off topic you you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">really go</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">deep into those topics of sex</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.639" style="s2">masculinity and god</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s really why i found and tried</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.639" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">to network with kevin and daniel</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">because i was searching for spaces to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">deep into those topics and i wanted i</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:24.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to have any censorship</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">i didn&#39;t want to have any</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.360" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">pre-conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">to change the way i want to approach</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">really the way i would</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">approach that and i&#39;ll throw it to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">kev</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">yeah brilliant i love that i&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">similar experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">i didn&#39;t even make it to grad school but</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">on my way i had a very similar</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">sense working in graduate student</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">laboratories</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">and for me the guiding principles tyson</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">i love these questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.480" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">really revolve around some notions i</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">have about reality itself which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">language is a bleeding edge</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:07.120" style="s2">language is a multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">template whatever that means like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.120" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to mean you know quantum</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">physics it just means</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">language is a type of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">magic it&#39;s a type of structuring</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">principle or scaffolding onto which</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">culture itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">is built so if that&#39;s the case which i</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">believe it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">then we can only evolve as fast as our</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">the breadth and width and depth of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">conversations are going to determine the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">level we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">heal connect and build a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">civilization which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">pretty obviously here in 2020 what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">kind of need to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">and i see some of the biggest divides</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">around the taboos</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">especially between the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">feminine and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">and around god itself and the the notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">of god</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">right and this this is part and parcel</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">of the issue</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">of the whole idea of censorship or</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">taboos in general it&#39;s like let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">talk about or</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">language these things let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">categorize these things because</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what to do with them</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:13.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m that&#39;s what i hear</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">culture say when it creates a taboo</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.600" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">so obviously the role of a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">and i self-style self-identifies</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">i believe daniel and kadel do as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.199" style="s2">the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">who&#39;s a lover of wisdom their role in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.199" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">the society is actually to bring these</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">up create context create culture and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">create conversations around them so we</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">kind of chose three titanic type</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">taboos to do this in and quickly some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">the other guiding principles</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:44.080" style="s2">definitely iron sharpens iron so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:45.919" style="s2">unique about these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">is that we we don&#39;t agree on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">later we might agree and come to a level</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">where like oh i really see your</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">perspective it actually gels with my</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">perspective but in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">we were we were you know just giving out</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">ideas and maybe disagreeing maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">changing or shifting perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">so um healthy competition a more of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">martial artist or dojo style of iron</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">sharpens iron</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">if i can speak something at the limit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">my understanding to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">and like as cadell was describing you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">don&#39;t become emotionally compromised and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">you can speak back your response</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">at the edge of your understanding we</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">both grow in our knowledge and our</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an incredible part of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">dialogue and what&#39;s really unique is</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:29.440" style="s2">unlike a dialogue or a dyad</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">a dyad tends to reach a stability or an</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.440" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">energetic where there isn&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">room because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">like think like ping pong in the triad</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">in the structure of a triangle</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">it creates a very unique third chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">element which actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:45.039" style="s2">most of our trilogues and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:45.520" style="s2">chapters of the book the territory we</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.039" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">end up</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.520" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">in with our ideation is so far afield</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">and so much more potent than what we</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">created in the structure</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s an emergent property of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">that is incredible</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">i&#39;ll pass to you daniel</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">thank you yeah i can just underline</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">everything what is said so far</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s on the line the appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">that we have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">able to talk that freely together and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">and bring this out because</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">i was pursuing a phd which uh i now also</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">dropped it because the frameworks of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">academia have been like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">too tight for me and to have this</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">conversation with carol and kevin</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">was just relieving was you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">because i could combine different</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">notions of investigation</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:37.360" style="s2">in one hand you have like the analytic</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">investigation</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.360" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">that i appreciate very much where you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">scrutinize oneself</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">on the other hand you have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">investigation that opens up your mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">patterns so you see similar patterns</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">all over which is very much from one</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">field that i also appreciate very much</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">as system science</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">so you try to find similar patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">all over uh different aspects or</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">well in system science you call them</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">systems you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:11.679" style="s2">and one thing that always is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.679" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">language and taboos</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">is that when you talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">taboo it&#39;s not taboo anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">you know so there is something very</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">unique about talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">what is hidden talking about what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">sacred</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">because what is sacred is the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">as taboo and what is taken what is taboo</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">you actually don&#39;t touch you don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:46.559" style="s2">why is that so because in this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.559" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">initial core of our in our driving</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">is that what we want to reach for and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">that is something very unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">it can be sex it can be gone but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">drives you to to really</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">focus on something without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">what it is in this black box because</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s taboo because it&#39;s sacred</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">because you don&#39;t talk about it so once</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">you talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">you bring it to the light you bring it</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">to the transparent and you change it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">so the biggest thing about talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">taboo</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">and talking about sex talking about god</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">and be kind of heretic to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the willingness to change</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">because it will change you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">what happened so much into</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">in in this conversations too you know it</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:47.440" style="s2">it is a mechanism itself that you also</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">find in psychotherapy and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.440" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">but if you bring it to that level it</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">brings you massive changes because</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">you have to question a lot if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">question these</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">kind of so intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">taboo topics</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">and yeah i think that that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">the most crucial part if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">really focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">on this conversations that bring you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">a way of change that you are progressing</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">in your self-development</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">that you&#39;re open to to make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:27.039" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">you know that you are open to discovery</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">what is the hidden behind the hidden</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">to to reveal that will change you and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">you have to have the willingness</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">to do that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:48.559" style="s2">really good thank you well alex s</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">having a clear sense of what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.640" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">be a man</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">what masculinity actually is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">be and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">you know all kinds of models from my</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">past you know parents</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">family members etc that don&#39;t really fit</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">with present reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">um and also you know whenever i&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">uh or really a kind of a guidance for</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">and uh so my question is um</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">so i appreciate you know the need to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">in discussion</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">and to be uh inquiring and i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">if you&#39;ve arrived at any kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:36.400" style="s2">uh maybe a sense of what the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.400" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">is in our time you know you mentioned uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a post-religious age we live in</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a uh it&#39;s an age of post-feminism</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">a man in our world</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">i think it&#39;s really well framed</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">and really thought out and i really feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">i really feel the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">behind your your question and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s an emotion that i i share</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">i share with you in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">in some of the conversations we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">specifically about</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">um gender archetypes and in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">conversations we specifically had about</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">um masculine movements i can i can open</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">um sort of how we&#39;ve approached this</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">this question that you&#39;re posing which</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">in the past before the modern period</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.840" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">um man and woman were seen to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">eternal essences they were seen to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:07.039" style="s2">um you know it would be impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.880" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">someone in the 15th century</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.039" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">to question their gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">it was the essence of their being it it</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">wasn&#39;t something where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">reflective distance</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">of course that all changes in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">and that largely changes because</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">the whole traditional structure um</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">kind of gets divided from within where</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">in the traditional world there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction between the public</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">sphere and the private sphere</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">and in the modern world that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">kind of annihilated in in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">everyone is now in the public sphere and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t think anyone would say that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">move is ethically wrong i think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">everyone should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">fully in the public sphere and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">fully able to express and perform and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">act in the public sphere</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">nonetheless the question of what that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">means for contemporary masculinity is</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">that i think we&#39;ve barely begun to</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">scratch the surface of so</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">let me quickly say that what i see in</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">contemporary masculine movements</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">is a type of strange um</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">inner identity tension between</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">and this can be seen in for example the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">red pill community</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">and this this this inner tension is</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:36.000" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">the man who wants to enact the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">traditional life</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">of 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">and the man who wants to just um</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">give in to his base level evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">impulses so</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">the man who just wants to enact the old</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">traditional scaffolding is basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">looking for some</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">order looking for some symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">certainty that would allow him to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">contain his sexual energy</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">whereas the man who&#39;s just acting on his</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">evolutionary impulses</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">is basically saying no conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:13.039" style="s2">scheme works i&#39;m just going to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">what is natural to my body and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.039" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">from my point of view both are dead end</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">and what i would offer as a potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">third way</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">and this is a third way that i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">to work out in myself</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not something that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">have a final answer for</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">but that third way is trying to connect</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">deeply with the real of my evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">impulse</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">not to deny it to accept that that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">my body and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">that&#39;s a part of me and that&#39;s strong</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.120" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">energy but</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">second to connect that energy</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">to a higher communal ideal of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">so for me personally what masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">would be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">is authentically connect with their</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">sexual energy</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">and then and then sublimate that energy</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:03.520" style="s2">to a new communal ideal of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">but that new communal ideal of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.520" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">leadership would of course take a much</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">different form in the networked</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:12.960" style="s2">age in the networked age look at what</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">we&#39;re doing right now this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.960" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">digital network</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">none of us are connected in physical</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">reality nonetheless i hope</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">in my speech i&#39;m bringing a type of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">know masculine type of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">through sublimation and that does good</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">for the men and women</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">who are in my network so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">my first</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:34.960" style="s2">start to the answer and i&#39;ll pass it to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:34.960" style="s2">you kev</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:42.080" style="s2">yeah i love what you said there i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:44.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of me that will pull kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.080" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">of an alan watts here and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">you know this is like water asking why</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">it&#39;s wet</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">if you&#39;re a man asking what masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of me that just wants to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">point out the absurdity of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">because in a way masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">is is like it&#39;s like the suchness if</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">you&#39;re in a male body you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re masculine on one level and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s so many shades now</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">and gradients and i obviously</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">experienced those as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">so that being said you know the reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">this question is being asked i</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:21.440" style="s2">imagine and the reason i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">masculinity is in crisis and confusion</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.440" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">and i can feel even in my body right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">like a little bit of the the anger and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">despair that this is a problem in our</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">age</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">and like i i&#39;ve experienced it and which</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">all of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">energy is why i&#39;ve followed this path</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">which has led me to this call</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">and writing this book with these two</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:58.559" style="s2">riddled with addiction and abuse so</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">a true image of masculinity and again</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.559" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">this is a working hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to enact this with my own</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">struggles and foibles</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">is a man that is uniting those together</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">what we need are men who are embodying a</p>

<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">archetype of masculinity and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">i think part of the impulse for this</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">book is much of our culture worships</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">death it&#39;s a death culture and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">the masculine figures</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">although they look real shiny on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">podium with their suit and tie</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">death culture is what is propping them</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">up so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">the ultimate thing is like if a man is</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">going to embody true masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">it must be life-giving for the culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">for the for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ll leave it there</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">beautiful words in here strong words</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">um what is the masculinity today</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">i mean we have pointed out now a bit the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">problems that</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">led to this uh question</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">in which uncertainty has been all over</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">in identity of masculinity as well as</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">in other areas of our world</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">and that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">one of the questions why we assume one</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">of the issues why we wrote this book</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:26.079" style="s2">to give some orientation about this</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">which we kind of also let it open</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">on one hand it is important to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">have the firm masculinity that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">opposing</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">uh femininity so we had talked about so</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:47.679" style="s2">the oneness that you create in relation</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">to a feminine so i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.679" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">that is one path that is very crucial</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">and needs</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.119" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">a firm balance and this balance</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">is not something that is firm</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:03.359" style="s2">for itself but is in relation</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">to the feminine so how you can make a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.359" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">compliment</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">on a healthy way to the famine being a</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:13.240" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">and the other way is really finding this</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.240" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">complementarity</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">in yourself where you are not</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.760" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">searching for the one to become the one</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">with someone else but where you try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:31.440" style="s2">in yourself completed fulfilled realized</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">where you also can embrace in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.440" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">as well as masculine as a feminine</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">energies so that is something i</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t agree fully with kevin i see it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">both ways are very important</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">so one hand what kevin is saying about</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">we need strong man let&#39;s stay</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">and here is to agree to cadel we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">this positive</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">way of man that know what they can</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">that know what they want i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">this leadership type of math is needed</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">with some new connotations which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">something more feminine like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">being a lot of in communication that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">allows this network</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">of self-determined individuals</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">and and by doing that i see also the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">possibility that there is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">a balance in yourself but always</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">in relation to someone else that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">also can perceive as</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">someone as one you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">the question is really what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">the lack</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">in yourself that you perceive</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">that you might want to fulfill with</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">and this lag is also kind of what what</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">drives you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">or that drives you unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">and in in your relationships when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">learn to start to really</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.920" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">uh see someone else that you love</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">and you finding out oh what you love</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">about the other person is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">actually something that i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">love about myself</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">you know and if you see this continuous</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">process issue of self-development of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">self-discovery</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">where you can find actually your</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">strength</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">to see that is what i can that is what i</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">want and this is what i stand for</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">then this is a proper collaboration in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">network possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">where there is not blaming where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">the power mechanism where you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">respect mutually and same equally to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">could be a man or a woman doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">i think this self-development is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">quite crucial and the the real question</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">about the masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">is how did how did we</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">get into this uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">how does it really help us to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:06.000" style="s2">to jump into this uncertainty to to ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">what is what we want for from oneself</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">what is what we want for our community</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">i think that the uncertainty it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">great blessing</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">that we are drawn into individually</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.680" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">on gender on identity as well as on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">state of the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">because it initiates the change it</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">is the first step to to a new path</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">and and i think we need to definitely</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">and for for a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">outcome out of that is really looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">inside of oneself and discover</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">what is the lack what is where is</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">not the love and the compassion for</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">oneself</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">you know where do we try to find it</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">where do we try to find security in</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">where do we try to find leadership in</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">where do we try to find love from</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">so i do think that these things are</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">crucial for community life</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">but how we can stand on the ground that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">we can give that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">ourselves first so we are not acting out</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">of a lack</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">but out of abundance</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">awesome fiona daniel is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">touching i think around your question</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">now so i&#39;m wondering if you want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">your question or</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">follow up um with where your question is</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">at now considering</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">daniel&#39;s comments sure um</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">i was wondering what i mean we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">a lot about this being a post-feminist</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">era but</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">feminism is obviously an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">movement what could do differently to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">create space for</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">the development of masculinity and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">a safe space for masculinity to grow</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">i can i can uh i can take that because i</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">something of a history with engagement</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">academic feminism for the past 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">i remember when i started college</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">i was in a community college and one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:29.200" style="s2">one of the courses they offered was</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">gender studies but</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.200" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">when i was taking the course what was</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">obvious was that</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t really gender studies it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">it was really it was really women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">studies</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">and it was viewing gender from</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">basically from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">femininity</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">so and i&#39;ve seen that be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">that&#39;s gone on now for a while so</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">my basic answer to your question i hope</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">i hope this is precise and simple</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">which is that for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">if feminism is going to make room for</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">matt</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">from masculinity to really think through</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">itself in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">then we need to we need to structure</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">gender studies</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">around the idea of positive tension</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">between masculine and feminine energies</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:25.119" style="s2">tension between masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">energies is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.119" end="00:41:30.800" style="s2">really important and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.720" style="s2">if we don&#39;t balance the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.800" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">masculine and feminine energies</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.720" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">we either get masculine domination</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">or feminine domination and neither</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">serves the whole so i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">paradoxically</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">in order to serve the whole we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">understand the tension between the two</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">and from that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">we can reinvent each other in a ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">symbiosis with each other because if the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:04.400" style="s2">feminine changes</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">then the masculine will change and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.400" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">the masculine changes</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">the feminine will change and we need a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">space that can contain that tension</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">and i think that that would be very</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">but then i&#39;ll share that with you kevin</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">that&#39;s all i have to say on that topic</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:26.240" style="s2">yeah this is this is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">and this comes up a lot in my</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.240" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">my profession i&#39;m a i&#39;m a coach for</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">and i do emotional integration work</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:36.880" style="s2">shadow work as well and a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">clients are really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.880" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">women in business and this is a number</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">one question they ask</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">is like how can we support men to heal</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">and integrate right because</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">um in some of the circles i&#39;ve run in</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">the conscious community the health and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">wellness community whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">call it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:56.079" style="s2">the women have been doing their work</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">longer they&#39;ve been gathering doing red</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">tent</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">doing doing ceremony doing deep healing</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">and interpersonal work and the men now</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">are really rising and i see the last</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">decade and really the last couple years</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">to really see</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">more and more groups activate and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">activate i think mankind project was</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">been holding it down</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">but there&#39;s so many new groups doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">this and a big part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:19.520" style="s2">you know the taboo around men showing</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">any kind of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.520" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">any kind of vulnerability at all walks</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">of life right from your working class</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">firefighter police officer but even</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">you know the male yoga teacher or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">male corporate gentleman you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.040" style="s2">those taboos are finally breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:38.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s finally enough context</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:39.839" style="s2">and healing momentum</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.079" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">that i think we can start to have those</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.839" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">circles emerge more and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:45.359" style="s2">now so the question of the direct</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.359" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">um this one&#39;s tough because it addresses</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:51.359" style="s2">one of the biggest shadows between</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">masculine feminine which is the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:56.079" style="s2">of codependency</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">and so if the woman is unwilling to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.079" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">detach from the man&#39;s process</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">not try to be his therapist but also</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">simultaneously without</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:06.880" style="s2">emasculating him or causing any female</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">deferment or all these other things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.880" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">identified um allowing him and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">to courageously do his work even if it</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">involves dissolution and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">really painful ego annihilation which it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">often does</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:21.280" style="s2">and in the same way if the woman&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">her work</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.280" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">and is connecting with other sisters and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">powering up</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">and clearing some of her trauma which</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">you know one in three women have like</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">serious sexual trauma i mean this is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">this is a systemic thing that touches</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">all of us</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">in the same way that man has to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">becoming her therapist</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">and demeaning controlling trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">trying to rush in with problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:47.760" style="s2">so that the very relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">masculine and feminine at the core</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.760" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">one-on-one level is a microcosm of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">men and women&#39;s work that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">and gets to happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">so the very simple way to support it</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">either way</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:03.920" style="s2">is to support it and not to meddle</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">and understand even though your</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.920" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">intentions are good that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">there&#39;s some things that men can only do</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">with other men</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">and vice versa there&#39;s some things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">women can only do with other women</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">and i think one of the most dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">things is this blurring</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:21.359" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s not i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">say it&#39;s transgenderism because</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.359" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not what it is but this whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">idea that gender is just</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">a role or it doesn&#39;t matter and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">the men and women&#39;s exclusion is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t agree with that at all just from</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:35.040" style="s2">personal experience you know all</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">philosophy and concept</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.040" end="00:45:39.280" style="s2">aside so yeah i really look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">women whether they feel like they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">the feminism strain</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">or not and more men even if they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">more traditional</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">alpha male roles to start to realize the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">importance of this work and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">to actually support one another even if</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">it&#39;s at a distance</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">so i&#39;ll leave it there for you daniel</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">thank you there have been so many</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">questions coming up here</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">on the right side and so beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">framed uh i just wanna i mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">there is a lot to talk about in here so</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">it makes difficult to recap all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">questions that are already here</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.839" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">and the first question that has been uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">asked to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">to make this round fully um but</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">i want to make some some comment about</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">durkheim</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">um about the sacred and the profane that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">was asked because um</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">it touches several questions that has</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">been asked here</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">too including the first question</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">what is what is the spaces that we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">and here comes is a kind of a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">where we hold attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">it is we need a sacred space</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">for the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">so the sacred it&#39;s like the unification</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s what we are drawn into</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">the sacred space is an empty space</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">too because it can allow things to</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">so one of the crucial things that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">is just give yourself the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">you know where you don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">give allow yourself just to be and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">brings up as a lot of things especially</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">if you make it to something</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">sacred it&#39;s because it&#39;s special to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like the first act of</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">self-compassion</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">the second is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">when we uh unify in something</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">sacred it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">it is because we really care on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:06.400" style="s2">if we have something that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">want to change about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.400" end="00:48:10.960" style="s2">and we we talk about the most sacred</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">that&#39;s on our self it is something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">we can talk about sex we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">our most intimate relationship and as</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.240" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">sad</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">it changes</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">and when when it comes to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">um what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:42.160" style="s2">what is really crucial about</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">masculinity and what do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">bring to ourselves and to to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">that we can make out of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">spaces</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">i believe that everybody brings</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">something on the table</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">and everybody is kind of different and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">what he</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">can really offer</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">and everybody has something that that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">unique to him and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">the most sacred point where you where</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:18.720" style="s2">you can reach</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">but to discover this and to hold spaces</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s like the second sacred space loop</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.119" end="00:49:28.960" style="s2">in which you can just unfold and detach</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">of everything that you thought about</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.960" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.839" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">and and this makes you like the king</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">in in the archetype we say that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">you know all that makes you the magician</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">this is to create this is the reality</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">that i create</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">but i do believe that especially in</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">our times in our civilization that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:58.640" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">right now we can create time</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.640" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">and this is something so crucial like</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:05.280" style="s2">you have the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to hurry from one thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.280" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">to the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">you have to take your time for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">this is the very first</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">act of self-compassion that leads you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">to discover yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">and to and people like kevin</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">that do these coachings you know or that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">you take the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">to listen to these podcasts you know is</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">already the first step that you care</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">and yeah i think these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">already steps but the ultimate step is</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">when you become</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">the creator of your reality you become</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">the creator</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">of what is intrinsic unique to you when</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:50.079" style="s2">you become the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.400" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">the architect that you want to be that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.079" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">you become the author that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.640" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">and so on but the beauty about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">is where do you find the spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:03.839" style="s2">you can co-create</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.119" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">another round of of it&#39;s not only about</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">the individual it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:31.599" style="s2">how to collaborate how to communicate</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:38.960" style="s2">from any change of thoughts to create</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.960" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">meaningful and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">manage this to do this is i think the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">next step that i&#39;m really intrigued to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">to see in stuff like small villages or</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">self-determined communities and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">like that also to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">put on uh one question was like do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">going for</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">tribal community masculinity i think the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:05.280" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">like the digital nomadism or digital</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.280" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">local community that has notions of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">tribal</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">is bringing this to a full circle what i</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">can see is in the future</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.400" style="s2">where you are actually very linked to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">the nature</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.400" end="00:52:24.800" style="s2">and to permaculture stuff or really</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">touching nature as well as</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.800" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">your sex as as your nature but you also</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.400" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">highly connected through the digital age</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:36.319" style="s2">and network</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">through the global spirit of united</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">but in in between is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">self-development of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">and this is going to be still a long</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">walk to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">together but i think here are pioneering</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">and they show strong individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">that have the courage to walk this path</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">of self-determination</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">that is what really meant the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">enlightenment to really say</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">we&#39;re we are not bowed to to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">anything but our our our mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">and we really want to do something out</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">not because someone is telling us but</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">because we want it</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">that was the initial part of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">but i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">we&#39;re now able to do that on because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">the technological level</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">but on a physical and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:33.760" style="s2">emotional and mental level</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2">we&#39;re still lacking very much behind to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.760" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">really ask us the question</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">do we really doing what we want</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s hard you know</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">but yeah my question is that uh it</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">sounds to me as if you&#39;re championing</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.599" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">a uh tribal communal masculinity like</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">returning to sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">collective networked masculinity um</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">it also sounds like your champion um</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:59.599" style="s2">championing like</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">sexual self-discovery and liberation um</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.599" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">and since men naturally compete over</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">women sort of in tribal setting</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">do you guys also champion traditional</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">and um or something else and do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:14.799" style="s2">see some sort of uh sexual regulation</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">that needs to be imposed</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.799" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to have a tribal way of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.680" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">for men you might say</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">thanks so much for your question aaron i</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.559" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">i love this question i i it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">question that has</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">it occupies so much of my mind um i have</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">my per my personal view is that one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:44.079" style="s2">the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">why marxism was so so much of a failure</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.079" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">and one of the reasons why practical</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.359" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">communist</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">politics is so ineffective</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:54.720" style="s2">is because they don&#39;t have an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.720" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">of human psyche and sociosexual</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.319" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">and one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:07.599" style="s2">roadblocks to authentic communism of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">communal</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.599" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">style of living is of course that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">our sublimations fall in a stable</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">pattern within</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:20.000" style="s2">what we call the nuclear family between</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">a man and a woman</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.000" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">raising children and overcoming that as</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">a stable</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">is to me the biggest possible challenge</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">you could think so i don&#39;t have i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">concrete um answers</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">but what i can say is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">whatever our sexual nature it</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">does not fall into a stable category</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">meaning if you say polyamory if you say</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:56:58.319" style="s2">monogamy if you say whatever category</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">you use</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.319" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">our sexuality does not fit neatly into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">it rebels against any mental</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">abstractions of this nature</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:12.960" style="s2">and that makes it extremely chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">and that makes it extremely emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.960" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">intensely disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">and most of our identities vis-a-vis</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:26.319" style="s2">are in my view reaction formations</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">against the chaos of this fact</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:30.319" style="s2">to give some stability to give some</p>

<p begin="00:57:37.599" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">is that this energy does find some</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">man and woman are linked by the child</p>

<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:58.079" style="s2">is i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.760" end="00:58:00.079" style="s2">in this sense one of the most authentic</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.079" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">sublimations that you can give your life</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:04.799" style="s2">because i had a conversation for example</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.520" end="00:58:07.920" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.799" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">um with one of my phd colleagues who</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.920" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">wrote a book and he has many and he has</p>

<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">and he was we&#39;re just remarking over how</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">much more complex and how much more real</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">his children</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">seem to him than his books or his phd</p>

<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s a way in which our cultural</p>

<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">pale in comparison to our biological</p>

<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">so if my here&#39;s my final here&#39;s my final</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.119" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">thought on this on this problem is if</p>

<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:40.160" style="s2">a transcendence to a higher order level</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:42.960" style="s2">of social being in a communal setting</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.160" end="00:58:44.559" style="s2">you have to treat very carefully how</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">these relations</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">are synergistically coherent with</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.680" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">reproduction if you don&#39;t figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">the synergies are coherent with</p>

<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">it will it will be a nightmare and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">will fall apart and it will disintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">so that to me is one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">horizons for thinking today and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">contemporary philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">i&#39;ll quickly give my my two pins here um</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.640" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">i agree with cadell this is the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:17.680" style="s2">um situation in communal environments</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">and having lived on eco villages and</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.680" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">talked to a lot of people creating them</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">even here in bali talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">creating them</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">the number the number one and two things</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:27.440" style="s2">that destroy intentional communities are</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">sex and money</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.440" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">which relate to power obviously the</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.200" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">and the sexuality one it&#39;s like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">been so repressed</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">in the christian west there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">taboo</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">um things like you know the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:45.280" style="s2">revolution polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">swinging all these these deviant you</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.280" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">know again</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">because of the repression modalities i</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:51.760" style="s2">think have emerged out of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">um and to your first point erin i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.760" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">this is a great question</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">um the communal tribally linked</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="00:59:58.400" style="s2">masculine is the strongest masculine in</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.400" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">opinion the isolated masculine and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">corporate high-rise on wall street or</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">the isolated masculine in the suburbs</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">is a very weak form and i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">a lot of evidence for that</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">now in a healthy tribal communal dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">and by healthy i mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:19.440" style="s2">there are clear agreements there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.359" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">clear shared goals and values</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.440" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">there&#39;s some form and it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">be religious but there&#39;s some form it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.799" style="s2">can be musical</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">it can be revelatory it can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.799" end="01:00:30.079" style="s2">initiatory it can be psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:32.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different ways to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.079" end="01:00:34.559" style="s2">create communitas that actually work</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.480" end="01:00:36.400" style="s2">they&#39;re all ancient i think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.559" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">modern spends we can obviously do with</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.400" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">tech and all the things we&#39;ve learned we</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:42.160" style="s2">can bring it all forward</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.680" style="s2">i&#39;m not proposing we go back to archaic</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">structures and just like</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.680" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">you know live in loincloths they tried</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">that in the 60s it was a nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">we can integrate and go forward and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">communal the communal tribe</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">collective and again this is this is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">sense i have i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.920" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">ever i would think fully experienced it</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">it does exist somewhere i hear good</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">things about tamara and portugal i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">know if any of you are familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">that community has a really long running</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">track record</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:17.680" style="s2">but the the issues of sexual competition</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:20.319" style="s2">with men and women would be non-issues</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">as nullified by the communitas field</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.319" end="01:01:22.880" style="s2">where if the whole village is presencing</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.880" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">and there is communication even if</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">so-and-so is sleeping with so and so and</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:29.920" style="s2">this person wanted to and like</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">you know all that stuff&#39;s just going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.920" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">exist you know we&#39;re tribal we&#39;re apes</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gods and we&#39;re apes it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">be there but i believe it can be</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">dealt with in a good way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">you know a game where people lose i</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">it can create a game where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">maturation and growth</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">and this is again elders if there are</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">elder men that hold business</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">of power and are properly respected</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:01:59.200" style="s2">mediation and ability to navigate these</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:01.280" style="s2">spaces is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.200" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">critical if it&#39;s a bunch of young 20</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:05.119" style="s2">alpha males that are in</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">that are basically 12 year old boys in</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.119" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">puberty and</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:10.000" style="s2">strong masculine bodies yeah it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">to turn into orgies it&#39;s going to turn</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.000" end="01:02:13.440" style="s2">into violence</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:15.599" style="s2">so if you have the intergenerational</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.440" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">dialogue if you have communitas</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.599" end="01:02:19.680" style="s2">if you have agreements and collective</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">value systems i believe it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.680" end="01:02:24.319" style="s2">navigateable</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s a belief so i&#39;m trusting</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.319" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:29.440" style="s2">before before you pick up daniel i just</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:31.920" style="s2">wanted to</p>

<p begin="01:02:31.920" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">kevin said about the win-loss dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:38.319" style="s2">that if someone gets sex someone else</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:41.359" style="s2">views that they don&#39;t get sex</p>

<p begin="01:02:47.119" end="01:02:52.000" style="s2">was something was taken away from me</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:52.640" style="s2">because they because they had sex this</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">is because</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">the second positive sum yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:03:00.400" style="s2">yeah we can&#39;t it&#39;s hard to view sex in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:03.680" style="s2">positive sum frame basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:05.119" style="s2">because because sex is one a super</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.680" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">enjoyable energy</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.119" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">and two of a feeling that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:12.799" style="s2">it&#39;s scarce a feeling that it&#39;s lacking</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">so when you combine this</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.799" end="01:03:17.680" style="s2">the extreme enjoyment from sexuality and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">the perception of lack of sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.680" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">it gets hyper valued so the only way in</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:26.960" style="s2">which that could be reduced</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:28.960" style="s2">is if there was an authentic sublimation</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.960" end="01:03:29.599" style="s2">where that same level enjoyment is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.960" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">produced</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.599" end="01:03:33.760" style="s2">inside the individual and the only</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">experience i know that can do that</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.760" end="01:03:39.200" style="s2">is the psychedelic experience so</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">if psychedelic experience was a part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">the community would that change the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:45.039" style="s2">we discuss sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that&#39;s a possibility but</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.039" end="01:03:49.039" style="s2">i&#39;ll give that to you daniel sorry for</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:53.039" style="s2">taking over</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.039" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">thank you very good thoughts still um</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.039" end="01:03:59.920" style="s2">to i&#39;m always the last one in the round</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.520" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s what is my my aim is always</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.920" end="01:04:05.440" style="s2">to to bridge kevin and cadell and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">put my synchronicities into that that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.440" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">always always my</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">my role and my position where i find</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:13.520" style="s2">myself i also very confident in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:16.880" style="s2">but sometimes it&#39;s hard because i have</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.520" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">so many thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.880" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">but um what i can say from here is um</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">i do think that we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:31.200" style="s2">a cultural change on the nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">nuclear family that&#39;s not especially in</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">that are still in this process where the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">man makes</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:38.960" style="s2">the money and the woman takes care about</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">the children</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.960" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">but we have other cultures where this um</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.920" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">this polarity has has changed into a</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">multiplicity</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:51.839" style="s2">we are right now with the with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">uncertainty on how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.839" end="01:04:56.319" style="s2">proceed on that</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">and if it comes about a tribal community</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.319" end="01:05:01.280" style="s2">or digital networking</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">person that is highly linked with</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.280" end="01:05:04.559" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">or if it&#39;s someone in in the city where</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.559" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">you have the multiplicity of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">possible relationships to to find</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:14.079" style="s2">yourself your sexuality and so on</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2">it becomes uh quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.079" end="01:05:17.920" style="s2">disturbing and and the need for some</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">stability</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:24.799" style="s2">is on the stake what i believe is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:28.000" style="s2">the desire that drives</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.799" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">sex and power</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.000" end="01:05:31.520" style="s2">is one of the challenges that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:34.839" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.520" end="01:05:37.039" style="s2">look outside of ourselves but inside of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.839" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">ourselves if we</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.039" end="01:05:43.200" style="s2">find desire in</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">in the sex and in in power about making</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.200" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s because it is the driving force</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.760" end="01:05:53.760" style="s2">of of change and</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">if we get stuck in it we also get stuck</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.760" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">in our self-development</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">that is why i appreciate on one hand</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">to have an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">where you can actually see someone else</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:10.400" style="s2">with all the love and have the sexual</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:14.240" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.400" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">but i also see that um as something that</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.240" end="01:06:20.400" style="s2">is not permanent that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:23.599" style="s2">can be permanent but uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.400" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">as soon as you reach a point</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.599" end="01:06:30.319" style="s2">where you change yourself that much</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:30.960" style="s2">that the attraction that the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.319" end="01:06:33.760" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.960" end="01:06:35.200" style="s2">gives to you is not something anymore</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.760" end="01:06:38.319" style="s2">that you feel</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.200" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">as something desirable</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:45.440" style="s2">then you change yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:47.520" style="s2">and if the relationship changes with you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.440" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">that is for me the most beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.520" end="01:06:51.680" style="s2">outcome that you can have</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">so the relationship continues and there</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.680" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">is continuous growth</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">paralleled what i see is</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:01.119" style="s2">with the multiplicity is that this</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">changes or the possibility to change or</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.119" end="01:07:05.200" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.839" end="01:07:06.559" style="s2">to to go through big changes of one</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.200" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.559" end="01:07:13.680" style="s2">is that breaks up are more often</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.559" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">which could be repaired more easily in</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.680" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">smaller communities because there is not</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:19.039" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:20.640" style="s2">of the multiplicity to get there but on</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.039" end="01:07:23.760" style="s2">the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.640" end="01:07:27.200" style="s2">i feel really if you just step</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.760" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">back from um</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.200" end="01:07:33.359" style="s2">from this is this is just love or this</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">is just sex or this is just</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.359" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">unconscious desire that driving me but</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">if you put yourself</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.440" end="01:07:43.520" style="s2">into a a reflective mode</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:44.319" style="s2">in a mature consciousness about your</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.520" end="01:07:47.039" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.319" end="01:07:50.000" style="s2">and your community you can take it</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:52.720" style="s2">always as something to grow from</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.000" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">and that should be if you stick together</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.720" end="01:07:57.280" style="s2">in a relationship or not</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:07:58.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter what i did find out</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.280" end="01:08:01.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.000" end="01:08:04.480" style="s2">if you have like a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.039" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">different sexual uh intercourses with</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.480" end="01:08:11.039" style="s2">everybody that disturbs a lot</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">uh every kind of of progress</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.039" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">you just get scattered instead of</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">into one and it&#39;s kind of just to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:22.719" style="s2">the other persons</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:25.359" style="s2">so i didn&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.719" end="01:08:26.719" style="s2">that this is like i mean if you would</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.359" end="01:08:31.279" style="s2">have like one person</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.719" end="01:08:33.839" style="s2">a week sex every day someone else</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.279" end="01:08:36.000" style="s2">i didn&#39;t think that is really healthy i</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.839" end="01:08:39.600" style="s2">mean i&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.000" end="01:08:43.440" style="s2">done this and i couldn&#39;t recommend it</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.600" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">but um to to go really deep</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.440" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">into a trusting uh relationship</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:52.319" style="s2">where you can hold spaces for each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:54.319" style="s2">it&#39;s something very meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.319" end="01:08:56.719" style="s2">but you don&#39;t have to get also in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.319" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">trap to be the third point of someone</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.719" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:02.799" style="s2">you know but just see okay that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:07.040" style="s2">me that&#39;s my growth</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.799" end="01:09:10.319" style="s2">you know and i do believe that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.040" end="01:09:14.319" style="s2">when you go into different phases</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">of learning of changing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.319" end="01:09:18.719" style="s2">you know you just become your desires</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">become less</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:25.839" style="s2">because you already got it you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.159" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">if you really followed like naturally</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.839" end="01:09:31.120" style="s2">okay i have this desire to have this</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.199" end="01:09:34.719" style="s2">sexual intercourse or</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.120" end="01:09:37.600" style="s2">this kind of powers and so on</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.719" end="01:09:38.319" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s the shortcut to say well</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.600" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.319" end="01:09:43.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t have these desires you know just</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:45.679" style="s2">happy as i am</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.600" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">but there is also like the long way of</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:48.319" style="s2">saying well i want to follow this</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">desires</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.319" end="01:09:51.759" style="s2">to feel complete and then you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">to figure out that</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.759" end="01:09:57.920" style="s2">another desire will come up you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:10:00.080" style="s2">and i also see that as something very</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.920" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">meaningful to follow</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.080" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">because otherwise you suppress it</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:11.199" style="s2">so i also um would say</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:12.239" style="s2">follow your dreams follow your desires</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.199" end="01:10:16.239" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.239" end="01:10:19.360" style="s2">at some point the desires</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.239" end="01:10:22.320" style="s2">become less and you really ask yourself</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.360" end="01:10:24.560" style="s2">what is what is meaningful behind all of</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.320" end="01:10:24.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:32.080" style="s2">and and there i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m more into</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.719" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2">into this buddhist perspective where</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.080" end="01:10:35.280" style="s2">like the happiness is like really here</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.320" end="01:10:38.080" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.280" end="01:10:39.920" style="s2">and as soon as you have a desire your</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.080" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">mind and your emotion goes into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.920" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">which is not something that exists</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:49.679" style="s2">and and happiness you find just in here</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.560" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.679" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">but to make this flow happy you know and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:58.960" style="s2">coherent with your life it&#39;s a free fall</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">because you don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.960" end="01:11:05.520" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">just uh accepting it more and more</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.520" end="01:11:11.760" style="s2">so for all the persons that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:13.920" style="s2">i mean there is a lot of unhealthy</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.760" end="01:11:17.600" style="s2">sexuality too</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.920" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">and i do think that it is useful to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.600" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">some regulations</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:26.480" style="s2">for these but to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">spaces for for everyone but in in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.480" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">course of how you develop yourself</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:37.199" style="s2">your desires changes and i do</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:40.640" style="s2">see that the desires</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.199" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">have also a certain arrow which</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.640" end="01:11:43.840" style="s2">which is to realize oneself completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:47.520" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.840" end="01:11:50.080" style="s2">something that is one we don&#39;t lack</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.520" end="01:11:50.080" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.560" end="01:11:56.080" style="s2">but you become real</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.840" end="01:11:58.960" style="s2">of your full potential which is like</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:11:58.960" style="s2">being the one</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.280" end="01:12:08.239" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll leave it like this for for now</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:09.120" style="s2">so many excellent kevin you have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.239" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">question would you</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.120" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">unmute and ask your question</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:19.440" style="s2">oh me hi i&#39;m always see hold on we find</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.560" end="01:12:23.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.440" end="01:12:25.760" style="s2">um yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.280" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">so chapter two of your book is something</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.760" end="01:12:28.800" style="s2">about uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:29.600" style="s2">the history of archetypes and i know</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.800" end="01:12:32.480" style="s2">kevin you</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">all oh i just realized my background is</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.480" end="01:12:37.840" style="s2">a bug i</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">totally didn&#39;t realize that sorry um</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.840" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">and uh alec bug i know right</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">um and kevin you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:48.080" style="s2">paint yourself as you use the word</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:50.960" style="s2">archetypal to describe yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.080" end="01:12:52.800" style="s2">um i&#39;m wondering what the role of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.960" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">framework of archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.800" end="01:12:57.760" style="s2">um plays in your respective analyses and</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:13:00.719" style="s2">understanding and in your trial log</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.760" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">and could you give some examples of say</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.719" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">how different archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:05.280" style="s2">have manifested themselves in the modern</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:07.920" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.280" end="01:13:10.239" style="s2">um where they&#39;re lacking and where they</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.920" end="01:13:12.640" style="s2">can be improved or what kind of new</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.239" end="01:13:13.760" style="s2">archetypes we should be striving for if</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.640" end="01:13:14.239" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way to word the</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.760" end="01:13:17.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.239" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">thank you okay so this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.679" end="01:13:21.440" style="s2">this is one of the topics where kevin</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:24.960" style="s2">daniel and i i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">have disagreements so this question of</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.960" end="01:13:28.880" style="s2">of archetypes so all safe i&#39;ll say for</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.880" end="01:13:35.199" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m kind of as i understand the</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:38.480" style="s2">jungian concept of archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.199" end="01:13:39.679" style="s2">it&#39;s that the archetype say for example</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.480" end="01:13:42.719" style="s2">the wise king</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.679" end="01:13:45.040" style="s2">or the divine queen or you know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.719" end="01:13:47.199" style="s2">divine feminine the divine masculine</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.040" end="01:13:48.080" style="s2">these are kind of reified as eternal</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.199" end="01:13:49.920" style="s2">essences</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.080" end="01:13:51.120" style="s2">that we discover in the collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.920" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.120" end="01:13:55.840" style="s2">and for me i don&#39;t really think</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">archetypes function in that way</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.840" end="01:14:03.760" style="s2">i think archetypes are basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.520" end="01:14:07.120" style="s2">ideas that emerged in evolution</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.760" end="01:14:10.239" style="s2">and that those ideas reflect</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.120" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">a type of evolutionary strategy</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.239" end="01:14:15.600" style="s2">in relationship to evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:18.640" style="s2">constraints so for example</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.600" end="01:14:19.440" style="s2">you could imagine primates very much</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.640" end="01:14:22.239" style="s2">like humans</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.440" end="01:14:22.960" style="s2">evolving in language self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:26.400" style="s2">that whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.960" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">happens and then you know conscious</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.400" end="01:14:31.199" style="s2">entities find themselves</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:32.159" style="s2">in sexuated biological bodies and they</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.199" end="01:14:36.000" style="s2">come up with</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.159" end="01:14:41.360" style="s2">two ideas which kind of cover the field</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.000" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">of you know one body seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.360" end="01:14:44.640" style="s2">stronger it doesn&#39;t have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:47.679" style="s2">reproduce</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:48.080" style="s2">uh has whatever more more muscle mass so</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.679" end="01:14:50.080" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.080" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">suited for certain functions another</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.080" end="01:14:53.440" style="s2">body is</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:54.880" style="s2">shorter it has the capacity to reproduce</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.440" end="01:14:56.640" style="s2">and so forth so it&#39;s going to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.880" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">filtered into these functions</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.640" end="01:15:01.120" style="s2">and that these get reified through</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:03.920" style="s2">different different historical epochs</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.120" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">i think that the crucial dimension in my</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.920" end="01:15:08.080" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:11.120" style="s2">is the asymmetry in the archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.080" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">in the modern period because women are</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.120" end="01:15:14.080" style="s2">collectively wanting to come into the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:16.880" style="s2">traditionally male</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.080" end="01:15:17.600" style="s2">field but it&#39;s not really the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.880" end="01:15:20.480" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.600" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">and and that&#39;s biologically determined</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.480" end="01:15:26.159" style="s2">to the degree that</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:27.920" style="s2">men can&#39;t men men biologically can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.159" end="01:15:30.800" style="s2">reproduce</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.920" end="01:15:31.199" style="s2">like men are biologically unable to</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.800" end="01:15:34.320" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.199" end="01:15:36.159" style="s2">embody that function whereas it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.320" end="01:15:38.960" style="s2">true the other way around</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.159" end="01:15:40.400" style="s2">so to me what this asymmetry in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.960" end="01:15:42.400" style="s2">archetype suggests</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.400" end="01:15:44.159" style="s2">is that these archetypes have nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.400" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">do with eternity</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.159" end="01:15:48.960" style="s2">what i mean here is that both to me</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:51.120" style="s2">here&#39;s the difficult thing to think</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.960" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">how can we think the asymmetry in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.120" end="01:15:54.880" style="s2">archetypes and the way in which they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">be historically transcended for</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.880" end="01:15:58.560" style="s2">something totally different</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:00.400" style="s2">and i think that that historical</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.560" end="01:16:01.840" style="s2">transcen transcendence to something</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.400" end="01:16:03.920" style="s2">totally different</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.840" end="01:16:06.080" style="s2">involves the way in which our identities</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.920" end="01:16:07.120" style="s2">get wrapped up between man woman and</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.080" end="01:16:09.719" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.120" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">so in some sense i think this</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.719" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">internalization of man woman and child</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:17.600" style="s2">internal to each individual is where</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:19.520" style="s2">we&#39;ll find new archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.600" end="01:16:21.600" style="s2">but i i don&#39;t know yet how that will</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.520" end="01:16:24.239" style="s2">manifest of course in our current</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.600" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">universe i think we see many archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.239" end="01:16:29.920" style="s2">of superheroes all sorts of action</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.679" end="01:16:32.480" style="s2">figures many different virtual figures</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.920" end="01:16:35.360" style="s2">in like world of warcraft or</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.480" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">you know there&#39;s all sorts of ways in</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.360" end="01:16:38.159" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:40.239" style="s2">consciousness plays with its body in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.159" end="01:16:42.960" style="s2">virtual avatar form</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.239" end="01:16:45.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s where i try to think what is</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.960" end="01:16:49.040" style="s2">the future of the virtual avatar</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.360" end="01:16:52.159" style="s2">visa vr body</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.040" end="01:16:52.159" style="s2">i&#39;ll pass that to you kevin</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.360" end="01:16:57.760" style="s2">yeah i love this question kevin and not</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.679" end="01:17:01.520" style="s2">just because we have the same name</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.760" end="01:17:02.000" style="s2">um i think i fall much more into the</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.520" end="01:17:05.600" style="s2">jungian</p>

<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:15.440" style="s2">on the teleology i do believe archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:16.960" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t know i wouldn&#39;t claim</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.440" end="01:17:18.560" style="s2">that they&#39;re some kind of eternal</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.960" end="01:17:20.159" style="s2">blueprint like plato&#39;s forms or</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.560" end="01:17:22.000" style="s2">something although i think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.159" end="01:17:24.320" style="s2">elegant way to talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.000" end="01:17:27.120" style="s2">but they do seem to be psychic dominance</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.320" end="01:17:29.920" style="s2">that are older than humanity itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.120" end="01:17:31.520" style="s2">and so when you analyze collective</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.920" end="01:17:33.520" style="s2">dreams and you analyze the myths of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.520" end="01:17:37.040" style="s2">world especially the creation myths</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.520" end="01:17:39.440" style="s2">when you analyze and just look at</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.040" end="01:17:40.159" style="s2">all the different ways humans have used</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.440" end="01:17:43.280" style="s2">animals</p>

<p begin="01:17:44.880" end="01:17:48.640" style="s2">interesting archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:50.800" style="s2">usually conveyed through symbol and</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.640" end="01:17:53.679" style="s2">story that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.800" end="01:17:54.800" style="s2">ubiquitous and so how do these manifest</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.679" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">in our life</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.800" end="01:17:58.480" style="s2">well they manifest in huge ways when you</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:02.320" style="s2">have eyes to see</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.480" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">and so i find that as a man</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.320" end="01:18:06.800" style="s2">archetypes can be extremely empowering</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">there&#39;s also a shadow side of being</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.800" end="01:18:10.880" style="s2">possessed by an archetype and</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:13.679" style="s2">grandiosity which is one of the</p>

<p begin="01:18:37.199" end="01:18:40.400" style="s2">the way i characterize archetypes is</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.280" end="01:18:42.560" style="s2">really like</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.400" end="01:18:43.600" style="s2">when you are embodying your best self</p>

<p begin="01:19:06.080" end="01:19:11.120" style="s2">you are very much embodying an archetype</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.120" end="01:19:12.719" style="s2">you could take a thousand of those cases</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.120" end="01:19:14.000" style="s2">we could all share the case where we</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.719" end="01:19:16.560" style="s2">were that person</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.000" end="01:19:18.480" style="s2">and i guarantee we could through</p>

<p begin="01:19:24.960" end="01:19:28.719" style="s2">that is something like an archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.719" end="01:19:31.360" style="s2">hero and there&#39;s many that</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.719" end="01:19:33.679" style="s2">that you can work with i i really enjoy</p>

<p begin="01:20:28.400" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">idea thought forms emotional energies</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:35.679" style="s2">and integris thought indeed that</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">characterizes</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.679" end="01:20:39.600" style="s2">what we what we think of as the best of</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:40.960" style="s2">us right when you think of a human that</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.600" end="01:20:44.080" style="s2">you would want to emulate</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.960" end="01:20:44.639" style="s2">i believe these humans are to some small</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.080" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.639" end="01:20:48.719" style="s2">more aligned with these archetypes than</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:51.760" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.719" end="01:20:51.760" style="s2">so i&#39;ll leave that there</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.440" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">okay um my notion of archetype is</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.199" end="01:21:05.440" style="s2">that there are as kevin said</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:06.320" style="s2">i studied anthropology in the first</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.440" end="01:21:08.400" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.320" end="01:21:09.440" style="s2">culture and social anthropology there</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.400" end="01:21:12.840" style="s2">are myths</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.440" end="01:21:16.239" style="s2">and archetypes that you find all over</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.840" end="01:21:19.040" style="s2">places times and cultures that</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.239" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any contact to each other</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.040" end="01:21:23.440" style="s2">you know so</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:26.960" style="s2">there is a notion</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.440" end="01:21:29.679" style="s2">they&#39;re not exactly overlapping like</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.960" end="01:21:30.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not like one-on-one but they</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.679" end="01:21:33.600" style="s2">have like</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.480" end="01:21:35.760" style="s2">different notions if if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.600" end="01:21:38.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re asking what i did is an</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.760" end="01:21:38.960" style="s2">investigation it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.440" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">the the archetypes tried to embrace like</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.840" end="01:21:45.520" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.719" end="01:21:46.639" style="s2">of the universe you know when we have it</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.520" end="01:21:49.280" style="s2">more detailed</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.639" end="01:21:51.280" style="s2">we have it in in horoscopes or in in</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.280" end="01:21:53.760" style="s2">calendars and so on</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.280" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">that that have like a circular way of</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.760" end="01:21:58.719" style="s2">seeing things</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:22:02.320" style="s2">we have for example water and fire</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.719" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">as two opposing archetypes so that</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.320" end="01:22:07.120" style="s2">we can find it ourselves with the fire</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:10.400" style="s2">of a passion the fire of the anger</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.120" end="01:22:13.920" style="s2">or the emotions of our tears and</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.400" end="01:22:17.760" style="s2">in in the water or also in</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.920" end="01:22:20.880" style="s2">in in depression or whatever so</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.760" end="01:22:21.360" style="s2">there are like the ideas that we create</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.880" end="01:22:24.719" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.360" end="01:22:27.840" style="s2">our our stories out of our language</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.719" end="01:22:31.280" style="s2">that is an ideal type as</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.840" end="01:22:33.840" style="s2">a sad already that we&#39;re striving for</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.280" end="01:22:36.480" style="s2">and this direction and we that we are</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.840" end="01:22:39.920" style="s2">striving for to be the ideal one</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.480" end="01:22:40.560" style="s2">the ideal is not the real so the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.920" end="01:22:43.760" style="s2">is always</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.560" end="01:22:47.120" style="s2">an idea that that leads us</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.760" end="01:22:48.080" style="s2">so the archetype is also an idea that</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.120" end="01:22:51.199" style="s2">leads us</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.080" end="01:22:52.360" style="s2">to something something bigger because it</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.199" end="01:22:54.800" style="s2">contains</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.360" end="01:22:55.679" style="s2">multiplicities of ideas from what we</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.800" end="01:22:59.040" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.679" end="01:23:02.719" style="s2">is to something that makes us</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.040" end="01:23:06.400" style="s2">more beautiful more true more</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.719" end="01:23:09.920" style="s2">more good somehow and</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.400" end="01:23:12.239" style="s2">in in the in the distinction of</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.920" end="01:23:13.280" style="s2">what kind of archetype we&#39;re striving</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.239" end="01:23:15.840" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.280" end="01:23:17.520" style="s2">it is also our desire of what we want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.840" end="01:23:20.800" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.520" end="01:23:24.159" style="s2">but how this becoming into the real</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.800" end="01:23:27.360" style="s2">of your unique oneness</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.159" end="01:23:31.120" style="s2">is displayed is not</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.360" end="01:23:35.040" style="s2">the fixed idea but it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.120" end="01:23:38.080" style="s2">the real of what you feel is ideal</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.040" end="01:23:41.280" style="s2">for the reveal for you</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.080" end="01:23:45.280" style="s2">so it has like the whole notion that can</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.280" end="01:23:48.400" style="s2">drive you to to become a better person</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.280" end="01:23:48.960" style="s2">to become a notion of or to become</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.400" end="01:23:52.400" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.960" end="01:23:56.239" style="s2">someone that is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.400" end="01:23:59.840" style="s2">ideal and</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.239" end="01:24:02.960" style="s2">one hand the the most</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.840" end="01:24:05.679" style="s2">i think where it comes to also into</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.960" end="01:24:07.199" style="s2">places where the ego kicks into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.679" end="01:24:10.480" style="s2">place where you become</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.199" end="01:24:12.560" style="s2">someone that thinks okay he is the king</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.480" end="01:24:14.080" style="s2">and he is like actually backing and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.560" end="01:24:17.360" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.080" end="01:24:20.159" style="s2">is is very uh dangerous too</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.360" end="01:24:21.360" style="s2">so one of the things that are quite</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.159" end="01:24:24.480" style="s2">crucial in here is</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.360" end="01:24:28.000" style="s2">is a humbleness in working with</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.480" end="01:24:31.120" style="s2">with archetypes that you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.000" end="01:24:33.280" style="s2">you&#39;re creating uh the king</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.120" end="01:24:34.239" style="s2">inside of yourself and you&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.280" end="01:24:37.280" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.239" end="01:24:40.000" style="s2">everybody is a king everybody is a lover</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.280" end="01:24:40.400" style="s2">and there is plenty of space for for</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.000" end="01:24:43.520" style="s2">every</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.400" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">everyone&#39;s uniqueness you know i think</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.520" end="01:24:47.360" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:51.360" style="s2">is very crucial working with archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.360" end="01:24:53.760" style="s2">and and when it comes to to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.360" end="01:24:55.280" style="s2">from the multiplicity into where we say</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.760" end="01:24:57.679" style="s2">okay we have for example</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.280" end="01:24:59.840" style="s2">as kevin said four archetypes where we</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.679" end="01:25:01.840" style="s2">say this is the year this is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.840" end="01:25:03.360" style="s2">it is it comes to the nation where there</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.840" end="01:25:06.080" style="s2">is only one</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.360" end="01:25:06.480" style="s2">you know where we you become just the</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.080" end="01:25:09.360" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.480" end="01:25:10.639" style="s2">that you are and that&#39;s where you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.360" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">thriving anymore to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.639" end="01:25:14.400" style="s2">something more ideal that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.480" end="01:25:18.719" style="s2">and this is the end of archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.320" end="01:25:18.719" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.800" end="01:25:25.760" style="s2">but as long as you you wish for</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.960" end="01:25:27.120" style="s2">being something that you&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.760" end="01:25:30.239" style="s2">archetypes are really</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.120" end="01:25:33.280" style="s2">really useful as long as you take a</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.239" end="01:25:33.280" style="s2">humble path with it</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.600" end="01:25:40.960" style="s2">thank you well we&#39;ve got many questions</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.000" end="01:25:43.360" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.960" end="01:25:44.239" style="s2">here um but we have come to 90 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.360" end="01:25:47.920" style="s2">it might be prudent</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.239" end="01:25:50.800" style="s2">to bring this to a close as</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.920" end="01:25:52.239" style="s2">peter might say um do you guys have any</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.800" end="01:25:53.040" style="s2">closing thoughts anything that you would</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.239" end="01:25:56.400" style="s2">like to</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.040" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">end with um before we do and maybe one</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.400" end="01:26:00.239" style="s2">day we can</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:26:02.400" style="s2">bring it in for a round two sure</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.239" end="01:26:04.880" style="s2">i think the thing that&#39;s being presenced</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.400" end="01:26:06.159" style="s2">throughout a lot of the questions</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.880" end="01:26:08.560" style="s2">a lot of the things that are being</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.159" end="01:26:08.960" style="s2">presenced in the chat have to do with</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.560" end="01:26:11.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.960" end="01:26:12.960" style="s2">paradox between the one and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.440" end="01:26:15.280" style="s2">multiplicity</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.960" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">so the one on the one hand is this</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.280" end="01:26:19.440" style="s2">desire for monogamy this desire for</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:22.480" style="s2">long-term relationships this desire for</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.440" end="01:26:23.679" style="s2">exclusivity this desire for closeness</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.480" end="01:26:26.880" style="s2">and intimacy with</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.679" end="01:26:28.719" style="s2">one other and on the other hand there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.880" end="01:26:30.719" style="s2">this desire for multiplicity which is a</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.719" end="01:26:33.440" style="s2">desire to explore identity</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.719" end="01:26:34.400" style="s2">and a desire to go into difference a</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.440" end="01:26:36.239" style="s2">desire to</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.400" end="01:26:37.679" style="s2">you know play with identity in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.239" end="01:26:40.000" style="s2">different way to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.679" end="01:26:41.360" style="s2">untethered from historical constraints</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.000" end="01:26:44.480" style="s2">and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.360" end="01:26:45.280" style="s2">and i just think i just think that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.480" end="01:26:47.760" style="s2">way in my</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.280" end="01:26:49.360" style="s2">personal life i have come to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.760" end="01:26:51.520" style="s2">this paradox between the one and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.360" end="01:26:54.480" style="s2">multiplicity</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.520" end="01:26:55.280" style="s2">is that if you go too strongly into the</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.480" end="01:26:58.639" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.280" end="01:26:59.600" style="s2">you become almost static and fixed in</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.639" end="01:27:01.760" style="s2">your identity</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.600" end="01:27:03.440" style="s2">to the point where neither you or the</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.760" end="01:27:05.760" style="s2">other can change</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.440" end="01:27:07.920" style="s2">and that becomes paralyzing and if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.760" end="01:27:09.679" style="s2">go too much in the multiplicity</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.920" end="01:27:12.159" style="s2">you go to the point where you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.679" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">like schizophrenic and fragmented and</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.159" end="01:27:15.520" style="s2">disconnected and</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.520" end="01:27:16.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re spread out over too many</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.520" end="01:27:21.600" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.960" end="01:27:25.600" style="s2">and somehow somehow we have to be able</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.600" end="01:27:26.159" style="s2">to cultivate nuance with our sexual</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.600" end="01:27:28.239" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.159" end="01:27:30.080" style="s2">and build long-term meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.239" end="01:27:32.159" style="s2">relationships with others whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.080" end="01:27:35.280" style="s2">sexual or not with them</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.159" end="01:27:36.480" style="s2">and at the same time leave space for</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.280" end="01:27:39.040" style="s2">exploration</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.480" end="01:27:41.120" style="s2">how to do that in my view is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.040" end="01:27:44.560" style="s2">unique to every individual</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.120" end="01:27:47.280" style="s2">but the path of extreme oneness</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.560" end="01:27:48.800" style="s2">and the path of extreme multiplicity are</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.280" end="01:27:51.520" style="s2">both dead ends</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.800" end="01:27:52.400" style="s2">so it has to be some sort of dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.520" end="01:27:55.040" style="s2">balancing</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.400" end="01:27:56.719" style="s2">of of oneness and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.040" end="01:27:58.480" style="s2">different to every person and i think</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.719" end="01:27:59.679" style="s2">it&#39;s different on a developmental</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.480" end="01:28:01.360" style="s2">trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.679" end="01:28:04.080" style="s2">meaning that it&#39;s going to be different</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.360" end="01:28:05.840" style="s2">at 20 than it is at 30 than it is at 40</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.080" end="01:28:08.080" style="s2">than it is at 50.</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.840" end="01:28:09.840" style="s2">um so i think that&#39;s that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.080" end="01:28:10.880" style="s2">presenced a lot and i just wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.840" end="01:28:13.440" style="s2">speak to that because i think</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.880" end="01:28:18.400" style="s2">metaphysically it&#39;s actually hard to</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.440" end="01:28:18.400" style="s2">language this this this balance</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.800" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s all i have to say thank</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.159" end="01:28:25.040" style="s2">you so much everyone thank you so much</p>

<p begin="01:28:37.840" end="01:28:42.320" style="s2">you so much for</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.120" end="01:28:44.239" style="s2">sharing this with us and and inviting us</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.320" end="01:28:46.400" style="s2">on here you know i i think</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.239" end="01:28:48.800" style="s2">the biggest takeaway is that while being</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.400" end="01:28:49.199" style="s2">in a in a dialogue and a discussion like</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.800" end="01:28:51.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.199" end="01:28:52.960" style="s2">with people that are very deep thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.360" end="01:28:54.639" style="s2">and are putting some heavy</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.960" end="01:28:56.639" style="s2">things on the line like heavy in a good</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.639" end="01:29:01.120" style="s2">way is really refreshing</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.639" end="01:29:03.920" style="s2">um that&#39;s one two i think</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.120" end="01:29:04.800" style="s2">clearly that we all are desiring in our</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.920" end="01:29:07.199" style="s2">own way</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.800" end="01:29:09.360" style="s2">to attain clarity and mastery around</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.199" end="01:29:11.600" style="s2">communal living in the sexual space</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.360" end="01:29:13.120" style="s2">and that that is pretty clear from a lot</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.600" end="01:29:14.639" style="s2">of these questions and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.120" end="01:29:16.080" style="s2">incredible because that is at the</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.639" end="01:29:17.440" style="s2">leading edge of</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.080" end="01:29:19.199" style="s2">what i think a lot of us want to do</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.440" end="01:29:20.239" style="s2">smart villages eco villages whether you</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.199" end="01:29:22.159" style="s2">actually want to live in them or you</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.239" end="01:29:23.760" style="s2">want to be part of a digital commons</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.159" end="01:29:25.840" style="s2">i mean this is what it&#39;s all about i</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.760" end="01:29:27.920" style="s2">think as we move forward so i&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.840" end="01:29:30.159" style="s2">to continue that conversation and</p>
